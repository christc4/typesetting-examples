# Will's Résumé

My personal resume written in Groff.
Individual customisation takes place in `WillCashmanResume.ms` whereas the main formatting and styling is done in the macro file `resume.tmac`. It is designed to be a simple framework for building clean, professional resumes.

After changing `WillCashmanResume.ms`, simply run `make` to update your changes in `WillCashmanResume.pdf`.
