# README

This is meant to be a simple example document that is easily readable so that it can be used as a learning tool to get up and running with groff very quickly.

I come form using markdown as well as LaTeX so this document is written with the point of view of someone looking for an alternative to LaTeX for professional looking documents.

I also just wanted to experiment with groff because I like retro computing and typesetting and the idea of using a typesetting system that is older than me to make documents just excites me a little bit.

This document will not go into depth on advanced features of groff like macros but I will attempt to address most features that can be found in markdown.

## TO DO

- [x] lists and bullets
- [x] images
- [x] figures and diagrams using PIC
- [x] equations
- [x] references
- [x] block-quotes
- [x] cover-page features
- [ ] headers and footers
- [ ] page numbering
- [ ] basic formatting (bold, italic, etc)
- [x] code listings
- [ ] tables
- [x] table of contents
- [x] compilation and PDF output
- [x] a short section containing helpful resource
- [ ] a simple guide on how to optimize your workflow and layout a project folder for a document

## Long Term Goals

- convert into a short document that expalins everythin on starting with groff.
- strip back the example document and split into a few samller ones with increasing complexity
- use more meaningful text in the examples
- better organization of the sections
