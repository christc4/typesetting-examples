        NOTICE:  This document describes a  program  which  the  Digital
        Equipment  Corporation has no committment to offer or support at
        this time.  This document is, however, believed to be  an  accu-
        rate description of RUNOFF.

        This version of RUNOFF is not supported by a working group with-
        in  the  Text Processing Special Interest Group.  If you experi-
        ence any difficulties, send a description of  the  problem,  to-
        gether  with  the  .RNO input file and the .DOC output file, to:
        Text Processing Special Interest Group, c/o DECUS, One Iron Way,
        MR2-3/E55,  Marlboro,  MA 01752.  Present plans call for support
        of RUNOFF in source form only.  It is recommended that you  keep
        a  reference copy of the distributed sources so that corrections
        and modifications may be distributed with SLP command files.

                                  INTRODUCTION




        RUNOFF (RNO) is a PDP-11 program to facilitate  the  preparation
        of  typed  or  printed manuscripts, such as memos, manuals, etc.
        The user prepares his material on any regular  PDP-11  terminal,
        and writes it onto a file using an appropriate editor.  The user
        includes not only textual material, but also case and formatting
        information.   RUNOFF then takes the file and reproduces it onto
        the line printer, terminal or other file to produce a final copy
        or final file image.  It performs the formatting and case shift-
        ing as directed, and will also perform line justification,  page
        numbering and titling, etc., as desired.

        The principal benefit of such a program is that  files  prepared
        for  use  with  it may be easily edited and corrected.  Small or
        large amounts of material may be added or deleted, and unchanged
        material  need not be retyped.  After a set of changes, the pro-
        gram may be operated to produce a new  copy  which  is  properly
        paged  and  formatted.   Documentation  may  thus  be updated as
        necessary without requiring extensive retyping.

        2.1  INITIATING RUNOFF

        RUNOFF can be initiated in several ways.   The  general  formats
        for RSX-11 users are:

                        General and Privileged Users
                                MCR>RNO <CR>
                                MCR>RNO filespec

                        Privileged User Only
                                MCR>RUN ...RNO/UIC=[uic]
                                MCR>RUN $RNO/UIC=[uic]



        2.2  RNO COMMAND STRING

        System programs usually require a command string to specify such
        things  as  input files and various options.  A standard command
        string has one of the following forms:

                        output-file=input-file

                                or

                        @command-file

        Both output-file and input-file are strings  comprising  a  file
        specification.

        The second form of command string  (@command-file)  is  used  to
        specify  an  indirect command file.  In this case each record of
        the file is used as a command string before any commands follow-
        ing the indirect command are accepted.

        The command string syntax is described more  completely  in  the
        User's Guide for the relevant operating system.

        2.2.1  FILE SPECIFICATIONS

        An RSX-11 file specification has the following form:

                        Dev:[UIC]Filename.Typ;Ver

        In this specification Dev must be a legal device code.  The  de-
        fault  value  is SY:, the system disk.  UIC must be a valid User
        Identification Code.  Filename is any 1- to 9-character alphanu-
        meric  string  which  specifies  a  file  name.   Typ is a 1- to
        3-character alphanumeric file type.  System programs default  to
        an  appropriate  standard type so the typical user will not have
        to explicitly specify it.  Finally, Ver is a number which is the
        version number of the file.  This field also normally can be om-
        itted since it defaults on input to the highest existing version
        number  for  the file and on output to the highest existing ver-
        sion number plus one.

        Default file specifications (any part of which may  be  overrid-
        den):

                        Input:   SY:RUNOFF.RNO

                        Output:  SY:RUNOFF.DOC



                             Editing RUNOFF Output

             RUNOFF output files may not be  edited  normally  with
             the  standard  RSX/IAS  file  editors.  To edit RUNOFF
             output, the output file must  first  be  processed  by
             TECO with a command of the format:

                     *ERfilespec$EWfilespec/-CR$EX$$





        2.2.2  RNO SWITCHES

        A file specification may have one or  more  switches  associated
        with  it.  A switch is an indicator, consisting of a slash and a
        two-character ASCII name, used to select program  options.   The
        switch  itself  may have three forms.  If the switch designator,
        for example, is SW, then:

                        /SW sets the switch action;
                        /-SW negates the switch action, and
                        /NOSW also negates the switch action.

        In addition the switch identifier may be followed by any  number
        of  values.   The  permitted  values  are  ASCII  strings, octal
        numbers, and decimal numbers.  The default for a value is octal.

        RSX/IAS OPERATING PROCEDURES                            Page 2-3



        Decimal  values  may  be  terminated by a decimal point.  Values
        preceded by a number sign (#) are octal;  the  octal  option  is
        included for explicit documentation purposes.  Any numeric value
        may be preceded with a + or a - sign;  if the number sign (#) is
        used,  the  +  or  -  must  precede it.  The following are valid
        switch specifications.

                        /SW:27:XXX:29.
                        /-SW
                        /NOSW:NOSWITCH:-#50


        RSX/IAS OPERATING PROCEDURES                            Page 2-4



        Eight switches control the RNO program.   These  switches,  des-
        cribed  below,  may  be  specified on either the input or output
        file specification.  the defaults may be set by the system  man-
        ager at Task Build time.

                /SP     -- Spool the output file
                /-SP    -- Inhibit spooling of output file

                /UC     -- Force ALL uppercase output
                /UC     -- Allow normal case conversion

                /FF     -- Force Form-feeds (instead of multi-LFs)
                /-FF:n  -- Simulate Form-feeds with Line-feeds
                                    n is paper length, default set by
                                        your system manager.

                /WA     -- Wait for CR input at beginning of each page
                /-WA    -- Continue printing each page with no wait

                /PA:L:H -- Output only indicated page range{*}
                                    L=lowest page number printed
                                    H=highest page number printed
                                    The default setting is to print
                                        all pages.

                /PS:m:n - Set Page Size to m,n
                                    (See PAGE SIZE command.)
                                    Default is /PS:58:60.

                /TE:A   -- Output device is an AJ832

                /TE:D   -- Output device is a Diablo

                /TE:N   -- Output device does not support scripting

                /HY     -- Hyphenate output

                /UL:B   -- Underline with a spacing-backspace

                /UL:L   -- Underline via line overprint with underline

                          RSTS/E OPERATING PROCEDURES






        3.1  INITIATING RUNOFF

        For RSTS/E users, RUNOFF is run by the general command format:

                                RUN $RNO
                                RNO> filespec

        If the RNO CCL command has been added to the system, the follow-
        ing format may also be used:

                                RNO filespec



        3.2  RNO COMMAND STRING

        RUNOFF resquire a command string  to  specify  input  files  and
        various  options.   A  command  string  has one of the following
        forms:

                        output-file=input-file

                                or

                        @command-file

        Both output-file and input-file are strings  comprising  a  file
        specification.

        The second form of command string  (@command-file)  is  used  to
        specify  an  indirect command file.  In this case each record of
        the file is used as a command string before any commands follow-
        ing the indirect command are accepted.

        The command string syntax is described more  completely  in  the
        User's Guide for the relevant operating system.

        3.2.1  FILE SPECIFICATIONS

        A RSTS/E file specification has the following form:

                        Dev:[PPN]Filename.Typ

        In this specification Dev must be a legal device code.  The  de-
        fault  value  is SY:, the system disk.  PPN must be a valid Pro-
        grammer- Project Number.  Filename is any 1- to 6-character  al-
        phanumeric  string  which specifies a file name.  Typ is a 1- to
        3-character alphanumeric file type.  System programs default  to
        an  appropriate  standard type so the typical user will not have
        to explicitly specify it.

        Default file specifications (any part of which may  be  overrid-
        den):

                        Input:   SY:RUNOFF.RNO

                        Output:  SY:RUNOFF.DOC


        Under RSTS/E, RUNOFF uses the RSX Run-Time  System  and  may  be
        task-built  to  output  its data as an RMS compatible sequential
        file which may be printed by the RSTS/E spooling package without
        further  processing.   To  convert  the  output  to  a  standard
        (ASCII-stream) RSTS/E file, the FLX system program may  be  used
        as follows:

                        RUN $FLX
                        FLX> OUTPUT.TXT/FA=OUTPUT.DOC

        where OUTPUT.DOC was output by RNO.   Normally,  RSTS/E  systems
        will use the "ASCII-stream" version of RNO.TSK.  Files output by
        this version of RUNOFF are compatible with BASIC-PLUS  I/O  for-
        mats.


                                      NOTE

             Source file input to RSTS/E RUNOFF may  be  either  in
             RMS compatible sequential file format or in BASIC-PLUS
             compatible ASCII-stream format.  In the  latter  case,
             all input lines must be terminated by <CR><LF> or <FF>
             sequences.  Other  sequences,  such  as  <LF><CR>  may
             cause erroneous output.

        3.2.2  RNO SWITCHES

        A file specification may have one or  more  switches  associated
        with  it.  A switch is an indicator, consisting of a slash and a
        two-character ASCII name, used to select program  options.   The
        switch  itself  may have three forms.  If the switch designator,
        for example, is SW, then:

                        /SW sets the switch action;
                        /-SW negates the switch action, and
                        /NOSW also negates the switch action.

        In addition the switch identifier may be followed by any  number
        of  values.   The  permitted  values  are  ASCII  strings, octal
        numbers, and decimal numbers.  The default for a value is octal.
        Decimal  values  may  be  terminated by a decimal point.  Values
        preceded by a number sign (#) are octal;  the  octal  option  is
        included for explicit documentation purposes.  Any numeric value
        may be preceded with a + or a - sign;  if the number sign (#) is
        used,  the  +  or  -  must  precede it.  The following are valid
        switch specifications.

                        /SW:27:XXX:29.
                        /-SW

        Seven switches control the RNO program.   These  switches,  des-
        cribed  below,  may  be  specified on either the input or output
        file specification.  the defaults may be set by the system  man-
        ager at Task Build time.

        RUNOFF is initiated with the RUN or R command:

                .R(UN) RUNOFF <CR>
                RUNOFF/RT-11 Version M02.4  October 1981   /I for Info.
                *



        4.2  RUNOFF COMMAND STRING

        RUNOFF's command string follows the format of most other RT-11
        system programs:

                        outfile{/sw...}=infile{/sw...}

        Only one input file is allowed.  The switch(es) may  be  applied
        to  either  file  with  no  difference in effect.  See the RT-11
        User's Guide for more information on command string syntax.



        4.2.1  FILE SPECIFICATIONS

        An RT-11 file specification has the following form:

                        dev:filnam.typ{[n]}

        In this specification, dev is a legal physical or logical device
        name.   The default is DK:, the user's default disk.  Filenam is
        any 1- to 6- character alphanumeric  string  which  specifies  a
        file.   The filename may be omitted for non directory-structured
        devices such as TT:, LP:  or PC:.  Typ is the file  "extension".
        The  default  extension  for input files is .RNO, and for output
        files, it is .DOC.  Finally, the number [n] may be used only  on
        output  files.   It is used to reserve space for the output file
        on disk.  It is normally not needed, as the default  reservation
        is  for  1/2  the  largest free space on the disk, or the entire

        second largest space, whichever is larger.  See the RT-11  manu-
        als for more information on it's useage.



        4.2.2  RUNOFF/RT-11 SWITCHES

        A file specification may have one or more "switches"  associated
        with it.  The syntax is:

                /o:oval   or   /o:dval.   or   /o:x{xx}

        The o is an option letter, oval is  an  octal  value  (default),
        dval  is a decimal value which is signaled by a period after the
        number, and the x{xx} is a 1 to 3 character alphanumeric  string
        which must begin with a letter.  See the RT-11 User's Guide con-
        cerning the command string  interpreter  for  more  information.
        RUNOFF/RT-11 recognizes the following switches:

                /B:n    -- Start printing with  page n{**}
                /E:n    -- Stop  printing after page n{**}

                /F      -- Simulate FF's with 66 lines/page
                           (uses multi-LF's)
                /F:n    -- Simulate FF's with n  lines/page
                           (uses multi-LF's)

                /H:NO   -- Disable hyphenation
                /H:YES  -- Enable  hyphenation (default)

                /I      -- Display useage information

                /T:A    -- Output device is an AJ832
                /T:D    -- Output device is a Diablo
                /T:N    -- Output device does not support scripting
                 (Default)

                /U:B    -- Underline with spacing-backspace (Default)
                /U:L    -- Use overprint-underscore
                /U:N    -- Supress underlining
                /U:S    -- Simulate with hyphen on next line

                /V      -- Display version of this program

                /W      -- Wait for RET> before each page







        ----------
        {**}the /B:n and /E:n switches do nothing on source files  which
        are chapter oriented.












                                   CHAPTER 5

                               SOURCE FILE FORMAT




        The source file contains the textual material which will  appear
        on the final copy, plus information to specify formatting.  Most
        importantly, upper and lower case information also may  be  sup-
        plied so that copy can be prepared on the terminal or other such
        device which can input only upper case letters.  All command in-
        formation  consists of regular ASCII printing characters so that
        a listing of the source file may be examined if the  final  copy
        is not exactly as desired.

        All material in the source file is taken to be source  text  ex-
        cept those lines beginning with a period.  A line beginning with
        a period is assumed to be a command, and must match one of those
        listed in chapter 4.  The commands provide the formatting infor-
        mation, and control various optional modes of operation.

        Usually the text is filled and justified  as  it  is  processed.
        That  is,  the  program  FILLS a line by adding successive words
        from the source text until one more word would cause  the  right
        margin to be exceeded.  The line is then JUSTIFIED by making the
        word spacings larger until the last word  in  the  line  exactly
        meets the right margin.

        The user may occasionally wish to reproduce the source text  ex-
        actly,  which  is done by disabling filling and justification or
        by use of the LITERAL command.  The program may be set  to  fill
        but  not justify, in which case the output will be normal except
        that lines will not be justified to the right margin.  The  pro-
        gram  may  also  be  set  to justify but not fill, although this
        would probably produce peculiar results and is not recommended.

        When the fill mode is on, spaces, and carriage returns occurring
        in  the  source  text  are  treated  only  as  word  separators.
        Multiple separators are ignored.

        Some of the commands cause a BREAK in the output.  A break means
        that  the  current line is output without justification, and the
        next word goes at the beginning of the next line.   This  occurs
        at the end of paragraphs.

        The program will advance to new pages as necessary, placing  the
        title  (if  given)  and the page number at the top of each page.

        SOURCE FILE FORMAT                                      Page 5-2



        The user may call explicitly for a page advance  where  desired,
        and  may  inhibit the occurrence of a page advance within speci-
        fied material.



        5.1  CASE INFORMATION

        Specification of case for files prepared on the terminal is done
        with  two  characters, circumflex (^, 136 octal), and back-slash
        (\, 134 octal).  The  appearance  of  a  circumflex  causes  the
        letter  immediately  following  to be transmitted in upper case.
        The appearance of a back-slash  causes  the  letter  immediately
        following  to  be  converted to lower case.  Any letter not pre-
        ceeded by one of these characters is transmitted in the  current
        mode.   The  mode is initially upper case, and is changed by the
        occurrance of two successive case control characters.  Two  cir-
        cumflexes  (^^)  cause the mode to be set to upper case, and two
        back-slashes (\\) cause the mode to be set to lower case.

        The use of the above corresponds to the use  of  the  shift  and
        shift-lock  keys  on  a  typewriter.  Usually, typing appears in
        lower case.  To type one letter in upper case, the shift key  is
        used.   The  shift-lock  is  set  to type a series of upper case
        letters, after which it is released.

        The following shows the uses of the case control characters:

        ^HERE IS A ^SAMPLE ^SENTENCE IN ^^UPPER CASE\\ AND LOWER CASE.  

        becomes:

        Here is a Sample Sentence in UPPER CASE and lower case.



                                      NOTE

             Case conversion takes place only on ASCII codes 101 to
             132 octal, that is, the upper case letters.  Any actu-
             al lower case letters (codes 141 to 172 octal) appear-
             ing  in  the source will be transmitted unchanged.  If
             the source is prepared on a device such as a DECwriter
             or  model  37  Teletype  which  produce letters of the
             proper case, the mode should be set to upper  case  at
             the  beginning  of the file and left unchanged for the
             remainder.


        An additional character, less-than (<, 074  octal),  capitalizes
        the  entire  word  it precedes.  It then returns the file to the
        current case.  This character is not engaged unless preceded  by
        the  FLAGS  CAPITALIZE  command.  Similarly, the FLAGS HYPHENATE
        command engages the special character  equals  (=,  075  octal),
        which  causes hyphenization to be suspended for the word it pre-

        cedes.



        5.2  SPECIAL CHARACTERS

        &  Ampersand     Underscoring

             The character ampersand (&, 046 octal) is used  to  specify
             underscoring.   The ampersand will cause the character fol-
             lowing it to be underscored, e.g. &f&o&o becomes _f_o_o.

             Underlining of a string of characters can also be specified
             in  a  manner  similar to that of the shift lock operations
             described above.  An appearance of  ampersand  preceded  by
             circumflex  (^&)  will  cause  underlining of all following
             characters except space.  An appearance of  ampersand  pre-
             ceded by backslash (\&) will disable this mode.

        #  Number Sign   Explicit space

             It is occasionally necessary to include spaces in the  text
             which  should  not be treated as word separators.  For this
             purpose, RUNOFF treats the number-sign  character  (#,  043
             octal)  as  a quoted space;  i.e.  it will print as exactly
             one space in the output, will never be expanded nor changed
             to a carriage return.

        _  Underline     Quote next character

             To allow the appearance of the special  characters  (amper-
             sand,  number-sign,  circumflex, or back-slash) in the out-
             put, the underscore character (_, 137 octal) is used  as  a
             quote  character.   The  character immediately following an
             underscore will be transmitted to the output with  no  for-
             matting effect.  The underscore itself is thus another case
             requiring quoting.  The following five  cases  occur:   _&,
             _^, _\, __, _#, _{, _}, and _|.

        ^  Circumflex    Upper-case shift or mode lock

             As described above, the circumflex character (^) is used to
             convert  the  letter  following  to upper-case.  It is also
             used to lock the case mode in upper case, and the underline
             mode  to  "underline  all text".  If it is to appear in the
             printed text, it must be preceded by  the  quote  character
             (_^).

        \   Backslash    Lower-case shift or mode unlock

             As described above, the backslash character (\) is used  to
             output the letter following in lower-case.  It is also used
             to lock the case mode in lower-case, and to disable  under-
             lining.  If it is to appear in the printed text, it must be
             preceded by the quote character (_\).

        SOURCE FILE FORMAT                                      Page 5-4



        <  Less-than     Capitalize next word

             If  FLAGS  CAPITALIZE  has  been  engaged,  the   less-than
             character (<) is a special character used to capitalize the
             entire word it precedes.  If it is to appear in the printed
             text, it must be preceded by the quote character (_<).

        =  Equals-sign   Hypenation disable

             If FLAGS HYPHENATE has been engaged, the  equals  character
             (=)  used  to disable hyphenation for the word it preceeds.
             If it is to appear in the printed text, it must be preceded
             by the quote character (_=).

        {  Left-brace    Reverse half-linefeed

             If the output device type is no  "N",  then  the  left  and
             right  braces are used for superscripting and subscripting.
             The  left-brace  ({   173   octal)   produces   a   reverse
             half-linefeed.   When  combined with the right brace (} 175
             octal)  scripting  is  created;   e.g.    {super}   becomes
             {super}, and }sub{ becomes }sub{.

        }  Right-brace   Forward half-linefeed

             As described above, the right brace (} 175 octal) when cou-
             pled with the left brace will produce scripting.  This will
             only occure when a scripting output device is selected.

        |  Vertical-bar  Engage/disengage alternate character set

             The vertical bar (|, 174 octal) acts as an  on/off  switch.
             it  will  alternatly  transmit  a  shift-out  and a sift-in
             character to  change  the  selected  character  set;   e.g.
             |ABC| becomes ABC.

        ^N Control-N     enchacement on/off;  red/black ribbon

             If an Anderson-Jacobson output device is selected,  a  con-
             trol-N (^N, 016 octal) will alternatly engage and disengage
             the print enchancement;  e.g.  NFOO^N becomes FOO.

             If a Diablo output device is selected, a control-N will al-
             ternatly  select  the  red  and  black  ribbon color;  e.g.
             NFOO^N becomes FOO.

                                RUNOFF COMMANDS




        The following commands will be recognized if they are at the be-
        ginning of a line started with a period.  Any line in the source
        file beginning with a period is assumed to be one of these  com-
        mands.   If it is not, an error diagnostic will be typed and the
        line will be ignored.  Some commands take one  or  more  decimal
        numeric  arguments.   These  are separated from the command by a
        space.  More than one command may be entered on a single line by
        separating the commands with a semicolon (;) or a period (.).

        Multi-word commands may appear in any form.   Thus,  .NO  HEADER
        and .NOHEADER are both legal.

        Many commands may be abbreviated.   Standard  abbreviations  are
        given below each command.



        6.1  TEXT FORMATTING


        .BREAK
        .BR

             causes a break, i.e. the current line will be  output  with
             no justification, and the next word of the source text will
             be placed at the beginning of the next line.

        .SKIP n
        .SK n
        .S n

             causes a BREAK after which n is multiplied by the number of
             spaces  between  lines.   The result is the number of lines
             skipped.  Output is advanced to the top of the next page if
             there  is no room on the current page.  If the current page
             is empty, SKIP does nothing.


        RUNOFF COMMANDS                                         Page 6-2



        .BLANK n
        .B n

             causes the current line to be output with no justification,
             skips  n line spaces, and then starts output of the current
             source text.  BLANK is like SKIP, except that the space  to
             be  left  is  independent  of line spacing.  If the page is
             empty, BLANK does nothing.

        .FIGURE n
        .FG n

             leaves n lines blank to make room for a figure or  diagram.
             If fewer than n lines remain on the current page, text con-
             tinues to fill this page, then the page is advanced  and  n
             blank lines are left at the top of the next page.

        .INDENT n
        .I n

             causes a BREAK and sets the next line to begin n spaces  to
             the  right  of  the  left margin.  The n can be negative to
             allow beginning a line to the  left  of  the  left  margin.
             However, a line cannot begin to the left of column 0.  If n
             is not supplied, the current paragraph indent is used.

        .PARAGRAPH n, v, t
        .P n, v, t

             causes a BREAK and formats the output paragraphs.  The n is
             optional  and,  if  present,  sets the number of spaces the
             paragraph is to be indented.  The default value for n is  5
             (n  can  also  have  a  negative value).  v is the vertical
             spacing between paragraphs.  v can range from 0 to  5.   (1
             is  single  spacing, 2 is double spacing, etc.) t causes an
             automatic TEST PAGE (see the TEST PAGE command).

        .CENTER n;text
        .CENTRE n;text
        .C n;text

             causes a BREAK and centers the following text in the source
             file.   The  centering  is over column (n + left margin)/2.
             If n is not given, it is assumed to be the right margin.


                                        NOTE

                  CENTER, RIGHT MARGIN, LEFT MARGIN, PAGE SIZE, and
                  STANDARD  take both relative and absolute values.
                  Relative values are expressed as +n or -n,  while
                  absolute values of n are unsigned.

        .FOOTNOTE n
        .FN n

             saves n lines at the bottom of the current page for a foot-
             note.  The n is multiplied by the number of spaces set with
             the SPACING command.  If insufficient room remains  on  the
             current  page, space is allocated at the bottom of the fol-
             lowing page.  The text of the footnote should begin on  the
             line  following  the  FOOTNOTE  command.  Indentation, case
             lock, justify, margins, spacing,  and  fill  are  preserved
             around  footnotes.  However, commands that affect page for-
             matting are illegal in a footnote.  Tab stops  are  illegal
             because  they are not preserved.  A footnote within a foot-
             note is also illegal.

             The actual space taken by a footnote can be  more  or  less
             than specified by n.  If necessary adjust n after examining
             a draft printout.

             The footnote is terminated with a line  beginning  with  an
             exclamation point (the remainder of which is ignored).

        .NOTE text
        .NT text

             starts an indented note.  This command  BLANKs  2,  reduces
             both  margins,  centers  the  text (if no text is given, it
             centers the word "NOTE"), and then BLANKS 1.  At this point
             you  enter  the text of the note.  If the left margin is at
             0, the margin reduction is 15, otherwise it is 5.

        .END NOTE
        .EN

             terminates the NOTE command, BLANKs 2, and reverts the mar-
             gins  and  spacing  modes to their settings before the last
             NOTE command.

        .LIST n
        .LS n

             starts an indented list with n spacing, moves the left mar-
             gin 9 spaces to the right for the first LIST command, and 4
             more spaces for each subsequent nested  LIST.   The  normal
             FILL  and  JUSTIFY  modes remain in effect.  Therefore, you
             must disengage them just after the LS command if you want a
             ragged right.

        .LIST ELEMENT;text
        .LE;text

             starts an item in the list, used in  conjunction  with  the
             LIST  comand.   The  elements are numbered sequentially and
             the number is given a negative  indent  so  that  the  list
             lines  up.   The  number  is  followed  by a period and two
             spaces so that the indent will be by -4.  The list elements
             are  separated  by  the standard paragraph spacing and TEST
             PAGE.  If you want to type the text on the same line as the
             command,  you  must separate the text from the command with
             any number of intervening spaces or tabs,  or  (optionally)
             one semicolon.

        .END LIST
        .ELS

             terminates the LIST command and returns to settings  before
             the last LIST command.

        .COMMENT text
        .; text

             causes the line to be ignored.  The text is not printed  in
             the  output  file,  but rather is used as a comment line in
             the source text.



        6.2  PAGE FORMATTING


        .PAGE
        .PG

             causes a BREAK and an advance to a new page.  If  the  cur-
             rent page is empty, this command does not advance the page.
             Just like an automatic page advance,  this  command  prints
             the title (if given) and page numbers on every page.

        .TEST PAGE n
        .TP n

             causes a BREAK followed by a conditional page advance.   It
             skips  to  the  next page if fewer than n lines are left on
             the page.  This capability is to ensure that the  following
             n  lines are all output on the same page.  This command has
             the form t as an optional argument to  the  PARAGRAPH  com-
             mand.

        .NUMBER n
        .NM n

             starts page numbering.  This is the default so there is  no
             reason  to  issue  this  command  unless  page numbering is
             disengaged.  If resumption of page numbering is desired  at
             a certain page, specify n.

        .NONUMBER
        .NNM

             disengages page numbering.  However, pages continue  to  be
             counted,  so that the normal page number can appear if page
             numbering is re-entered with the NUMBER command.

        .CHAPTER text
        .CH text

             starts a new chapter using the text as  the  title  of  the
             chapter.   This  command  acts  as if the following command
             string were entered:

                  .BREAK;.PAGE;.BLANK 12;.CENTER;CHAPTER n

             The n is incremented by 1 automatically.  After the CHAPTER
             n is typed on the page,

                  .BLANK 2;.CENTER;text;.BLANK 3

             occurs.  This command then resets the case, margins,  spac-
             ing,  and justify/fill modes.  It also clears any subtitles
             and sets the chapter name as the title.

        .NUMBER CHAPTER n

             supplies a number (n) to be used in  a  subsequent  CHAPTER
             command.   NUMBER CHAPTER would be used when a chapter of a
             document occupies a source file of  its  own.   In  such  a
             case,  NUMBER  CHAPTER  would  be  the first command of the
             source file.

        .HEADER LEVEL n text
        .HL n text

             starts a section at the level specified and takes the  fol-
             lowing  text  as the header.  n can range from 1 to 5.  The
             sections are incremented by 1 automatically, and the number
             is  output  in  the  form  i.j.k.l.m.  If this is a chapter
             oriented document, the i is the chapter number.  Otherwise,
             it  is the number of the .HL 1 level.  This command acts as
             a

                  .BREAK;.TEST PAGE 9;.BLANK 3

             followed by the section number, two spaces, and the section

             name.  HEADER LEVELS 1 and 2 end with a BREAK.  HEADER LEV-
             ELS 3,4, and 5  end  with  a  space-dash-space  combination
             (#-#).

        .TITLE text
        .T text

             takes the remaining text as the title  and  outputs  it  on
             every page at line 0.  The default is no title.  If a title
             is desired, this command must  be  entered  in  the  source
             file.

        .FIRST TITLE text
        .FT text

             Same as TITLE, but used to specify the title to be  printed
             on  the first page of the document.  This command must pre-
             cede all text in the source file.  Use of the  FIRST  TITLE
             command  is the only way to print a title line on the first
             page of the document.

        .SUBTITLE text
        .SUBTTL text
        .ST text

             takes the remaining text as the subtitle and outputs it  on
             every page.  It appears directly under the title.  The sub-
             title is not indented, but indentation can be  achieved  by
             typing leading spaces.

        .INDEX text
        .X text

             takes the remaining text on the line as a keyword and  adds
             it,  along  with  the  current page number, to the internal
             index buffer.  The command does  not  cause  a  break.   It
             should appear immediately before the item to be indexed.  A
             keyword may be indexed more than once.

        .DO INDEX text
        .DX text

             forces a new page, centers the text, if given, otherwise it
             centers  the  word "INDEX".  This command prints the entire
             contents of the index buffer.  Entries are printed  in  al-
             phabetic  order  and  are  set  against  the  left  margin.
             Regular line spacing is used, except that a blank  line  is
             left  between entries of different first letters.  The page
             number of each entry is placed on  the  same  line  as  the
             entry  and  in  the  middle  of  the page.  Additional page
             numbers for multiple entries follow, separated  by  commas.
             The index buffer is left empty.

        .PRINT INDEX
        .PX

             forces a new page after which it prints the entire contents
             of  the  index buffer.  Entries are printed in alphabetical
             order and are set against the left  margin.   Regular  line
             spacing  is  used, except that a blank line is left between
             entries of different first  letters.   The  number  of  the
             first  page on which each entry appeared is put on the same
             line as the entry, beginning at  the  middle  of  the  line
             (midway  betweeen  the left and right margins).  Additional
             page numbers for multiple entries follow, separated by com-
             mas.  The index buffer is left empty.

             .PRINT INDEX and .DO INDEX perform the same task.  The only
             difference is that .PRINT INDEX does not interrupt the nor-
             mal chapter and page sequencing.

        .SUBPAGE

             executes a PAGE with page numbering  suspended.   The  page
             number  is  unchanged, but letters are appended to the page
             number.  This permits insertion of additional pages  within
             an  existing  document  without  changing the existing page
             numbering.

        .END SUBPAGE

             disengages the SUBPAGE command by executing a PAGE  command
             with page numbering resumed.

        .APPENDIX text
        .AX text

             starts a new appendix using the text as the  title  of  the
             appendix.   This  command  acts as if the following command
             string were entered:

                     .BREAK;.PAGE;.BLANK 12;.CENTER;APPENDIX a

             The a is a letter that is incremented alphabetically  auto-
             matically.  After the APPENDIX A is typed on the page,

                     .BLANK 2;.CENTER;text;.BLANK 3

             occurs.  This command then resets the case, margins,  spac-
             ing,  and justify/fill modes.  It also clears any subtitles
             and sets the appendix name as the title.

        .NUMBER APPENDIX a

             supplies a letter (a) to be used as the letter for a subse-
             quent APPENDIX command.

        .HEADER arg
        .HD arg

             causes the page header (title, subtitle, and  page  number)
             to  be  printed.  Arg should be UPPER to specify upper case
             characters for the title text, LOWER to specify lower case,
             or MIXED.  The initial setting is HEADER UPPER.

        .NOHEADER
        .NHD

             causes the page header (title, subtitle, and  page  number)
             to be omitted.  The header lines are completely omitted, so
             that text begins at the top of the page with no top margin.



        6.3  MODE SETTING


        .JUSTIFY
        .J

             Causes a break and sets subsequent output lines to be  jus-
             tified (initial setting).  The command increases the spaces
             between words until the last word exactly meets  the  right
             margin.

        .NOJUSTIFY
        .NJ

             Causes a break and  prevents  justification  of  subsequent
             output lines to make a ragged right margin.

        .FILL
        .F

             Causes a break and specifies that subsequent  output  lines
             be filled (inital setting).  Sets the justification mode to
             be that specified by the last appearance of JUSTIFY or  NO-
             JUSTIFY.   FILL  adds successive words from the source text
             until the adding of one more word  will  exceed  the  right
             margin.   It  stops  before  putting the last word in.  (If
             hyphenation has not been  disabled,  RNO  will  attempt  to
             break words which cause line overflow into syllables.)

        .NOFILL
        .NF

             disengages the FILL and JUSTIFY  modes.   This  command  is
             used to permit typing a table.

                                        NOTE

                  1. The nofill-nojustify mode need  be  used  only
                  where  there  are several lines of material to be
                  copied exactly.  A single line example  will  not
                  require  using these commands if there are breaks
                  before and after.

                  2. Normally FILL and NOFILL are used to turn both
                  filling and justification on and off.  It is usu-
                  ally desirable to do both.  A subsequent  appear-
                  ance of a justification command will override the
                  fill command however.

                  3. Because of the action of FILL, a single occur-
                  rance  of  NOJUSTIFY  will cause the remainder of
                  the file to be unjustified, with filling as spec-
                  ified.  In order to justify but not fill (not re-
                  commended), a JUSTIFY command must  follow  every
                  NOFILL command.



        .UPPER CASE
        .UC

             sets the output mode to upper case.  This comand  acts  the
             same  as typing two circumflexes (^^).  This is the default
             mode.  There is no need to type  this  command  unless  the
             mode was previously altered to lower case.

        .LOWER CASE
        .LC

             sets the typeout mode to lower case.  This command acts the
             same as typing two backslashes (\\).

        .FLAGS CAPITALIZE
        .FL CAPITALIZE

             enables the less-than (<) character to capitalize  the  en-
             tire  word  it  precedes.   It then returns the file to the
             current case mode.  This special character is  usually  off
             and  must be typed at the very beginning of the source text
             to enable  this  character.   Typing  a  space  or  another
             less-than (<) returns the file to the current case lock.

        .NO FLAGS CAPITALIZE

             tially off and must be typed at the beginning of the source
             file   to  enable  this  character.   The  FLAGS  HYPHENATE
             character is used to disengage hyphenization for words  im-
             properly hyphenated by the hyphenization algorithm.

             left  margin.  The initial setting is 60.  If n is not sup-
             plied, the current page width (set with the PAGE SIZE  com-
             mand) is used.

        .PAPER SIZE n,m
        .PAGE SIZE n,m
        .PS n,m

             sets the size of the page n lines by m columns and sets the
             right margin to m.  The default setting is 58,60.

        .PITCH n,m
        .PIT n,m

             sets the horizontal and vertical pitch on a supporting out-
             put  device.   The horizontal pitch is "n" and is specified
             as characters per inch.  The value must divide evenly  into
             60  for  Anderson-Jacobson  devices and into 120 for Diablo
             devices.  The default is 12.

             The vertical pitch is "m" and is  specified  as  lines  per
             inch.   "m" must divide evenly into 48.  The default is the
             hardware setting.  "n" and "m" may be set independently.

        .SPACING n
        .SP n

             sets the number of spaces between lines.  The n  can  range
             from  1 to 5.  The default setting is 1.  SPACING 1 is like
             single spacing on a typewriter and SPACING 2 is like double
             spacing.   SPACING  2  puts one blank line between lines of
             text.

        .STANDARD n
        .SD n

             returns all parameters, except the pitch settings, to their
             initial settings and sets n as the page width.  If STANDARD
             60 is specified, margins are reset LM 0, RM 60,  PAGE  SIZE
             58,60,  SPACING 1, paragraph indent 5, and FILL and JUSTIFY
             are enabled.  STANDARD 70 sets right margin to 70 and  page
             size to 58,70.

        .TAB STOPS n,n,...
        .TS n,n,...

             sets tabs.  The n must be greater than 0 and listed in  as-
             cending  order.   If  tabs  already  exist,  the issuing of
             another TAB STOPS command clears all previous  tabs  before
             setting new ones.  The default tabs are set at eight-column
             intervals to match the Digital  hardware  standard.   These
             tabs  are at columns 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, and
             80.  The tabs are converted to the  appropriate  number  of
             non-expandable  spaces.   If there are no regular spaces to
             the left of the tabs, they will print out at the  appropri-
             ate  position,  even  if FILL is on.  If LITERAL is on, the
             tabs are not converted to spaces, but are output as tabs.

        .AUTOPARAGRAPH
        .AP

             causes any blank line or any line starting with a space  or
             tab to be considered as the start of a new paragraph.  This
             command allows normally typed text to be justified  without
             special  commands.   It does not cause a paragraph if blank
             lines are followed by a command.

        .NOAUTOPARAGRAPH
        .NAP

             disengages the AUTOPARAGRAPH mode.

                             RUNOFF ERROR MESSAGES



        RUNOFF produces error messages in the following format:

                        ?RUNOFF-level-error message

        This appendix tabulates the error messages produced  by  RUNOFF.
        Most of the error messages are self-explanatory.  In some cases,
        RUNOFF prints the line in which the error has occurred, so  that
        the  user  can  examine the source line which caused the problem
        and correct it.

        The RT-11 version has some system-specific  messages  which  are
        listed at the end of this appendix.

             1.  ?RUNOFF-F-INTERNAL BUFFER OVERFLOW

                 This message is an internal program  error  and  should
                 never occur in normal use.

             2.  ?RUNOFF-E-ILLEGAL COMMAND text ON OUTPUT PAGE nn

                 where nn is the page on  which  the  command  text  oc-
                 curred.

             3.  ?RUNOFF-E-CAN'T JUSTIFY LINE:  text

                 where text is a line containing no spaces  (other  than
                 quoted spaces), so that RUNOFF is unable to justify it.

             4.  ?RUNOFF-F-FATAL ERROR, ABORTING

                 This an message is internal program  error  and  should
                 never occur under normal use.

             5.  ?RUNOFF-F-ERROR ON OUTPUT FILE

                 A write error has occurred on the output file.  One  of
                 the following conditions exists:

                 1.  The device is full or is write protected.

                 2.  The hardware has failed.

        RUNOFF ERROR MESSAGES                                   Page A-2



                 3.  The user does not have write access  privileges  to
                     the file.


             6.  ?RUNOFF-F-ERROR ON INPUT FILE

                 A read error has occurred on an input file.  One of the
                 following conditions may exist:

                 1.  A problem  exists  with  a  physical  device  (e.g.
                     device cycled down).

                 2.  The file is corrupted or the format is wrong.

                 3.  The file is a nonsource file.  (Object file, etc.)


             7.  ?RUNOFF-F-NOT ENOUGH MEMORY

                 The input file contained either too many INDEX  entries
                 and  RUNOFF ran out of index buffer space or a FOOTNOTE
                 command has caused overflow of the buffer reserved  for
                 footnotes.   RUNOFF  stops  processing  the input file.
                 The user should delete some index entries and/or reduce
                 the  amount  of  footnote  text  for the last page pro-
                 cessed.

             8.  ?RUNOFF-E-CAN'T INDENT LIST ELEMENT

                 The user has nested lists that cause RUNOFF to  attempt
                 indenting beyond the right margin.

             9.  ?RUNOFF-E-CAN'T REDUCE MARGINS

                 A NOTE command occurred after the margins were  set  to
                 values that prevent the NOTE command from reducing mar-
                 gins by 15.

             10. ?RUNOFF-E-COMMAND SYNTAX ERROR

                 The user has entered a command in a  format  that  does
                 not conform to syntax rules.

             11. ?RUNOFF-E-OUTPUT FILE SPECIFICATION ERROR

                 An error  exists  in  the  output  file  specification.
                 Correct the specification and re-enter the command.

             12. ?RUNOFF-F-OUTPUT FILE OPEN FAILURE

                 The file system, while attempting to  open  the  output
                 file, has detected an error.  One of the following con-
                 ditions may exist:

                 1.  The user's directory file is protected  against  an

                 2.  A problem exists with the physical device.

                 3.  The volume is not mounted.

                 4.  The specified file directory does not exist.

                 5.  The device is full of write protected.


             13. ?RUNOFF-E-INPUT FILE SPECIFICATION ERROR

                 An  error  exists  in  the  input  file  specification.
                 Correct the specification and re-enter the command.

             14. ?RUNOFF-F-INPUT FILE OPEN ERROR

                 The file system, while  attempting  to  open  an  input
                 file, has detected an error.  One of the following con-
                 ditions may exist.

                 1.  The user directory file  is  protected  against  an
                     open.

                 2.  A problem exists with the physical device.

                 3.  The volume is not mounted.

                 4.  The specified file directory does not exist.

                 5.  The file does not exist as specified.


             15. ?CSI-F-error message (RT-11 only)

                 The RT-11 command string interpreter  was  unable  com-
                 plete successfully.  see the RT-11 System Messages Man-
                 ual for the meanings of these messages.

             16. Bad switch /x (RT-11 only)

                 The indicated switch is not recognized by RUNOFF/RT-11.

                                BUILDING RUNOFF



        RSX-11M MAPPED SYSTEMS

        All command files follow the standard RSX-11M conventions.

             1.  [100,10] should contain all source modules.

             2.  [100,20] should contain the file RNOASM.CMD.

             3.  [100,20] will recieve the object output files.

             4.  [100,30] will receive listing files.

             5.  [1,20] should contain the file RNOBLD.ODL

             6.  [1,24] should contain the file RNOBLD.CMD

             7.  [1,34] will receive the map output file.

             8.  [1,54] will receive the task image file.

        Procedure:

             1.  Use UFD to set up the proper UFDs, if necessary.   Note
                 that all command files must be changed if you do not do
                 this.

             2.  Use FLX to move the files to their proper UICs.

             3.  Set the UIC to [100,20] and assemble.
                                 SET /UIC=[100,20]
                                 MAC @RNOASM

             4.  Use PIP to construct a concatenated object file for all
                 RNO files:
                                 PIP>RNO.OBS=*.OBJ

             5.  SET THE UIC to [1,20] and build  a  library  containing
                 the RNO object files:
                                 SET /UIC=[1,20]
                                 LBR>RNO/CR=[100,20]RNO.OBS

             6.  Edit the Task Build command file to reflect your  indi-
                 vidual  system needs.  The Task Build command file con-
                 tains parameters to set the default  switches,  default
                 paper size (for /-FF) and default underline mode.

             7.  Build the task image file.  The map will go  to  [1,34]
                 and the task image to [1,54].

        RSX-11M UNMAPPED SYSTEMS

        Users of unmapped systems should follow the  procedure  outlined
        for  mapped  systems,  but  selecting UICs as appropriate.  File
        RNOBLD.CMD will have to be edited to delete the /MM  switch  and
        to change the PAR directive to match system requirements.


        RSX-11D/IAS

        Users of RSX-11D/IAS should follow the  procedure  outlined  for
        users  of  RSX-11M  Mapped  systems.   Since the conventions for
        source and object files are installation dependent, all .CMD and
        .ODL   files   should   be  edited  accordingly.   Additionally,
        RSX-11D/IAS users should alter  RNOBLD.CMD  to  change  the  /MM
        switch to /MU and to change the PAR directive as needed.

        Alternatively, IAS users may use command file RNOIAS.CMD to  as-
        semble  and  build RUNOFF.  The command file contains parameters
        to set the default switches, default paper size (for  /-FF)  and
        default underline mode.


        RSTS/E

        To build RUNOFF under RSTS/E V06C-03  systems,  run  the  $BUILD
        program and specify the RNOBLD.CTL control file on the distribu-
        tion medium.  RNOBLD.CTL assumes that all files have been copied
        to  account  [100,100]  (use PIP.SAV).  If users desire to build
        directly from the distribution or from another account, it  will
        be   necessary  to  edit  RNOBLD.CLT  to  change  references  to
        [100,100] to the [p,pn] used in the distribution.  Both the RT11
        and  RSX  Run-Time Systems are assumed present in the system, as
        the PIP.SAV, MAC.TSK, LBR.TSK, and TKB.TSK programs are required
        in the build procedure.  The Task Builder run will normally pro-
        duce the message:

        ?TKB -- *DIAG*-MODULE ERR    MULTIPLY DEFINES SYMBOL EOF

        This is not an error.  At the  (successful)  completion  of  the
        procedure, RNO will be ready to run.

        The last step of RNOBLD.CTL copies the files  necessary  to  use
        RNO  (i.e., RNO.TSK and RUNOFF.RNO) to account [1,2].  This step
        should be deleted or changed if users do not desire to store RNO

        BUILDING RUNOFF                                         Page B-3



        in [1,2].

        To use the Concise-command language feature of RSTS/E, the  fol-
        lowing CCL command should be installed:

                        CCL RNO=[P,PN]RNO.TSK

        RNO.TSK is not a privileged program.  It should, however, be in-
        stalled with an <104> protection code if it is desirable for all
        users on the system to access it.


        RT-11

        First copy all of the files from the distribution  medium  to  a
        disk with at least 500 blocks free.  Delete the files RUNOFF.RNO
        and RUNOFF.DOC from the disk.  Assign that disk as DK:Then type:

                @RNOASM<cr>

        After the assembly is complete, link RUNOFF by typing:

                @RNOLNK<cr>

        There should be no error messages.  RUNOFF  takes  approximately
        8KW of memory.  If it is desired to make RUNOFF smaller, the de-
        finition of the symbol H$$PHN in the file RNPRE.MAC may be edit-
        ed  out, which will eliminate the hyphenation feature.  then the
        file RNOLNK.COM should be edited to remove the line which  links
        HYPHEN.OBJ into RUNOFF.  In addition, processor that support the
        EIS instruction  set  may  speed  the  operation  of  Runoff  by
        un-commenting  I$$EIS  in  RT11.MAC.   Reassemble RUNOFF.MAC and
        UARITH.MAC and then relink.

        A good test is to process the RUNOFF.RNO documentation file.
