There is the file runoff.info from
http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics/doc/info_segments/

But it is better called here: `Multics_runoff_1979.txt'

#####

There are 2 files for `runoff' in Multics at
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/honeywell/multics/

1) from 1980: AG92-03A_multicsCmds_Feb80.pdf
This file is complete.  And so the `runoff' part is extracted as the
file: `Multics_runoff_1980.pdf'.

2) from 1987: AG91-04A_mpmVol2_Jan87.pdf
This file is incomplete, but has the same information for `runoff' as
the file of 1980 above.  So this file is not used here.

So the only usable `Multics runoff' documentation is the file:
`Multics_runoff_1980.pdf'.
