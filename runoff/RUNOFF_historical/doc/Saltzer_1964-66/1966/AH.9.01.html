Saltzer, X6039<BR><BR><U>Purpose</U>The command TYPSET is used to create  and  edit  12-bit  BCDline-marked   files.    This  command  permits  editing  andrevising by context,  rather  than  by  line  number.    Thecommand RUNOFF will  print  out  (in  a  format  subject  tocontrol words placed in the file via TYPSET)  a  12-bit  BCDline-marked file in  manuscript  format.    RUNOFF  containsseveral special control features  which  were not  availablewith the DITTO command, including type-justification.<BR><BR><U>References</U>This work represents one more iteration in the arduous  taskof creating an "ultimate" editing scheme.  As  such,  it  isprimarily a synthesis of techniques which have  been  provenvaluable in several separate problem areas.  It is felt thatthis particular synthesis brings  to  bear  on  the  editingproblem an easy to use  package  of  techniques,  and  mightprovide a  model  for  an  editor  on  a  "next  generation"time-sharing system.  Here is a list of some of the  sourcesof ideas for these commands:      J. McCarthy              (Colossal typewriter)      S. Piner                 (Expensive Typewriter)      P.

TYPSET,  along  with  thecommand RUNOFF,  is  a  replacement  for  the  (old  system)commands MEMO, MODIFY, and DITTO.  Editing is  specified  bycontext, rather than line number, and input is  accomplishedat high speed since the program  does  not  respond  betweenlines.<BR><BR><U>Usage</U>                        TYPSET name"name" specifies the primary name of a file to be edited, orof a file to be created; it may be absent, in which  case  afile is to be created, and must be named later by the "FILE"request.When TYPSET is ready for typing to begin, the  word  "Input"or "Edit" is typed, and the  user  may  begin.    If  he  iscreating a file, he begins in high-speed input mode;  if  heis editing a file, he begins in edit mode.<BR><BR><U>High</U>-<U>Speed</U> <U>Input</U> <U>Mode</U>In high speed input mode, the user may type lines of  up  to360 characters in length (e.g., 120  underlined  characters)separated by  carriage  returns.    He  does  not  walt  forresponse from the program or the supervisor  between  lines,but may type as rapidly as desired.  The full character  setof his keyboard may be used.The user leaves high-speed input mode and enters  edit  modeby typing an extra carriage return.  When  switching  modes,the program acknowledges the switch by typing  the  name  ofthe new mode, "Input" or "Edit".<BR><BR><U>Edit</U> <U>Mode</U>In Edit mode, the program recognizes "requests" of the  formgiven below.  All requests take effect immediately on a <u>copy</u>of the file  being  edited.    Except  where  a  request  isexpected to cause a response, such  as  "PRINT,"  successiverequests may be  entered  immediately  on  successive  lineswithout waiting for a  response  from  the  program.    Eachseparate request must begin on a  separate  line.    Programresponses are typed in red, if you use a two-color ribbon.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  3<BR><BR><U>Character</u> <U>Set</u>The standard  12-bit  character  set  is  available.    (SeeSection AC.2.01.)  The preset erase character is #  and  thepreset kill character is @ .  The 1050  characters  lozenge,cent sign, plus-over-minus, and exclamation point should not  *be used in TYPSET memos.  Anticipated future changes to  the1050 character set are <u>not</u> guaranteed to preserve  the  codevalues or existence of these characters.<BR><BR><U>Requests</u>Editing is done line by line.  We  may  envision  a  pointerwhich at the beginning of editing is above the first line ofthe file. This pointer is moved down to different  lines  bysame requests, while other requests specify some  action  tobe done to the line next  to  the  pointer.    All  requestsexcept FILE may be abbreviated  by  giving  only  the  firstletter.  Illegal or misspelled requests  will  be  commentedupon and ignored.For purposes of description, the requests have been  dividedinto two categories, those necessary for  effective  use  ofthe command, and special-purpose requests which are  not  sogenerally   useful.    The  first  category  includes  eightrequests:LOCATE character string     This request moves the pointer down to the  first  line     which contains the given character string.  Only enough     of the line need be specified to identify  it  uniquely.     Since the pointer only moves <u>down</u> through the file  the     second   occurrance   of  a  line  containing  a  given     character string may be located by  giving  the  LOCATE     request  twice.  The  line  which  has  been  found  is     printed in its entirety.     It is not necessary to count blank characters  exactly.     If one blank character appears at  some  point  in  the     request string, any number of blank characters or  tabs     at the corresponding point in the file will  be  deemed     to satisfy the request.  If 2 blank  characters  appear     together in the request string, there must be at  least     two blank characters or tabs at the corresponding point     in the file, etc.     If the LOCATE request fails to find a  line  containing     the given character string, a message is  printed,  and     the pointer is set to point after the last line in  the     file.  Any requests which were  typed  in  between  the     LOCATE which failed and the message  from  the  program     about the failure are ignored.  Another LOCATE  request    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  4     will move the pointer back to the top of  the  file  to     begin another scan down through the file.PRINT n     Starting at the pointer, n lines  are  printed  on  the     typewriter console.  The pointer is left  at  the  last     line printed.  If n Is absent, 1 line  is  printed  and     the pointer is not moved. If the pointer is  not  at  a     line (e.g., above or below the file, or at a line  just     deleted) only a carriage return is typed.NEXT n     This request moves the pointer down "n" lines.  If  "n"     is absent, the pointer is moved to the next line.DELETE n     This request deletes "n" lines, starting with the  line     currently being pointed at.  The pointer is left at the     last deleted line.  If "n" is absent, the current  line     is deleted and the pointer not moved.INSERT new line     The line "new line" will be inserted after the line  by     the pointer.  The first  blank  following  the  request     word is part of the request word, and not part of   the     new line.  The pointer is set to  the  new  line.    To     insert  more   than   one  line,  give  several  INSERT     requests, or just type a carriage return to  switch  to     high-speed input mode.  All lines  typed  are  inserted     after the line being pointed at.  When the user returns     to edit mode by typing an extra return, the pointer  is     set to the last inserted line.  If the very first  edit     request given is an  INSERT,  the  inserted  lines  are     placed at the beginning of the file.  If an  INSERT  is     given after the pointer has run off the bottom  of  the     file, the inserted lines are placed at the end  of  the     file.CHANGE /string 1/string 2/ n G     In the line being pointed at, the string of  characters     "string 1" is replaced  by  the  string  of  characters     "string 2".  If "string 1" is void, "string 2" will  be     inserted at the beginning of the line.   Any  character     not appearing within either  character  string  may  be     used in place of the "slash" character.  If  a  number,     "n", is present, the change  request  will  affect  "n"     lines, starting with the one being  pointed  at.    All     lines in which a change was made are printed.  The last    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  5     line scanned is printed whether a change  was  made  or     not.  The pointer is left at the last line scanned.  If     the letter "G" is absent, only the first occurrence  of     "string 1" within a line will be changed.   If  "G"  is     present, all occurrences of "string 1"  within  a  line     will be changed.  If "string 1" is  void,  "G"  has  no     effect.   Blanks  on  CHANGE-request  strings  must  be     counted exactly.        Example:        line:                It is a nice day in Boston.        request:             CHANGE /is/was/        new line:            It was a nice day in Boston.        request:             CHANGE xwasxisx        new line:            It is a nice day in Boston.        request:             CHANGE ' '.' g        new line:            It.is.a.nice.day.in.Boston.        request:             CHANGE '."        new line:            Itis.a.nice.day.in.Boston.        request:             CHANGE "tis"t is"        request:             CHANGE '.' ' G        request:             CHANGE 'on 'on.'        new line:            It is a nice day in Boston.FILE name     This request is used to terminate the  editing  process     and to write the edited file on the disk.   The  edited     file is filed as "name (MEMO)".  If "name"  is  absent,     the original name will be  used,  and  the  older  file     deleted.  If no name was originally given, the  request     is Ignored and a comment made.  If "name" Is given  and     a file of that name already exists, the  user  will  be     asked If he wishes to delete the old file.   When  this     request Is finished, the user returns to command level,     and the supervisor will respond by typing "R"  and  the     time used.TOP     This request moves the pointer back to above the  first     line in a file.The following seven requests are handy for special purposes,but will probably not be used as often as the onespreviously described.BOTTOM     This request moves the pointer to the end of  the  file     and switches to input mode.  All lines which  are  then     typed are placed at the end of the file.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  6ERASE c     The   character   "c"   becomes  the  erase  character.     normally, the character "#"  is  the  erase  character.     (The erase character is used to delete  the  previously     typed character or characters.)KILL c     The   character   "c"   becomes   the  kill  character.     Normally, the character  "@"  is  the  kill  character.     (The kill character is used to delete the  entire  line     currently being typed.)APPEND character string                                       *     The string of characters "character string" is appended     to the line being pointed at.VERIFY p     If the parameter, "p" is "OFF", the  following  program     responses are not automatically typed:               "INPUT" or "EDIT" when the mode is changed.               Lines found by the FIND or LOCATE requests.               Lines changed by a CHANGE request.     If  the  parameter  "p"  is  "ON",  the   responses are     restored.  The command begins In "ON" mode.RETYPE new line     The line "new line" replaces the line being pointed at.     The first blank following the request word is  part  of     the request word and therefore is not part of  the  new     line.FIND character string     This request moves the pointer down to the  first  line     which <u>starts</u> with the given character string.SPLIT name     All the lines above the pointer are split into  a  file     called "name (MEMO)".  Any old copy of "name (MEMO)" is     deleted.  The  remainder  of  the  file  may  still  be     edited, and  filed  under  another  name.    The  SPLIT     request may be used several times during a single edit,     if desired.  Unless at least one "TOP" request has been     given, "name" must be different from the original  name     of the file being split.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  7QUIT                                                          *     This request is used to terminate the  editing  process     without making any changes to the  original  file,  and     without creating a new file.   All  intermediate  files     are deleted, and the user returns to command level.<BR><BR><u>Backspacing</u>The backspace  key  may  be  used  to  create  overstuck  orunderlined characters.  All overstruck characters are storedin a standard format, independent of the way they were typedin.  CHANGE-, LOCATE-  and  FIND-request  strings  are  alsoconverted to this standard format, so it is not necessary toremember the order in  which  an  overstruck  character  wastyped in order to identify it.   For  example,  suppose  theline:                 The N&Oslash;RMAL M&Oslash;DE statement of MADhad been typed in by typing the letters NORMAL, fivebackspaces, a slash, and four forward spaces.  The slashed &Oslash;in N&Oslash;RMAL can be changed to a standard O by typing                        CHANGE '&Oslash;'O'<BR><BR><u>Restricted</u> <u>Names</u> <u>and</u> <u>Recovery</u> <u>Procedures</u>Two special names are used for intermediate files by TYPSET.They are:          (INPUT FILE)          (INPT1 FILE)Following a QUIT sequence (or a CTSS system  breakdown)  oneor both of these files may  be  found.    (Whenever  a  QUITsequence has been given, a SAVE command should be issued  tosave the status of all files.)   Because  the  (INPT1  FILE)generally contains a complete copy of  the  file  since  thelast TOP command,  it may be renamed and used  as  a  sourcefile, and may permit recovery of lost requests.  The  (INPUTFILE) contains only that part of the file <u>above</u> the pointer,and therefore contains only a partial record of the originalfile.  The original file is never  deleted  until  the  new,edited file has been successfully written and closed.The intermediate files are  normally  written  in  permanentmode.  If the user's track  quota  becomes  exhausted  whileediting,  TYPSET will switch to temporary mode  intermediatefiles.  If it is necessary  to  leave  the  edited  file  intemporary mode, a comment will be made.If a new  file  name  is  to  be  created  (including  theseintermediate files) and the user already has a file  of  thesame name in his directory, he is first asked if  he  wishesto delete the old file.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  8                Summary of TYPSET requests.<BR><BR><u>abbrev.</u>                <u>request</u>                 <u>response</u>Basic requests:   L             LOCATE string              line found *                                            end-of-file   D             DELETE n                   end-of-file   N             NEXT n                     end-of-file   I             INSERT line                none   P             PRINT n                    printed lines,                                            end-of-file   C             CHANGE QxxQyyQ n G         changed lines *   T             TOP                        none                 FILE  name                 Ready messageSpecial-purpose requests:   B             BOTTOM                     "Input" *   V             VERIFY ON (or OFF)         none   S             SPLIT name                 no name given   R             RETYPE new line            none   E             ERASE x                    none   K             KILL x                     none   A             APPEND string              none              *   F             FIND string                line found *                                            end-of-file   Q             QUIT                       Ready message     ** These responses will not occur if VERIFY mode is off.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01     12/66  9            A Right-Justifying Type Out Program<BR><BR><BR><u>Program</u> <u>Name</u>: RUNOFF<BR><BR><u>Program</u> <u>Description</u>RUNOFF is a command used to type  out  memorandum  files  ofEnglish text, in manuscript format.  Control words scatteredin the text may be used to provide detailed control over theformat.  Input files may be prepared by the context  editor,TYPSET.<BR><BR><u>Usage</u>              RUNOFF NAME1 -P1- -P2- ... -Pn-       NAME1   is the primary name of a file "NAME1  (MEMO)"               to be typed out.       P1,P2,  etc.,   are    any      number      of    the               following parameters, in any order:       STOP    Pause between pages.       NOWAIT  Suppress the initial pause to load paper  and               the pause between pages.       PAGE n  Begin printing with the page numbered "n".       BALL n  Typewriter is using printing ball  "n".    If               this parameter  is  omitted,  Runoff  assumes               that the ball in use will properly print  all               CTSS characters in the file.  The number  "n"               is engraved on  top  of  the  printing  ball.               CTSS characters not  appearing  on  the  ball               being used will be printed as blanks, so that                  they may be drawn In.<BR><BR><u>Control</u> <u>Words</u>Input generally consists  of  English  text,  360  or  fewercharacters to a line.  Control words must begin a new  line,and   they   begin  with  a  period  so  that  they  may  bedistinguished from other text.  RUNOFF does  not  print  thecontrol words..line length n     Set the line length to "n".  The line length is  preset     to 60.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  10.indent n     Set  the  number  of  spaces  to  be  inserted  at  the     beginning of each line to "n".  Indent is preset to 0..undent n     In an indented  region,  this  control  word  causes  a     break, and the next line only will be indented n spaces     <u>fewer</u> than usual.  This  control  word  is  useful  for     typing indented numbered paragraphs..paper length n     This control word is used for running off a  memorandum     file on non-standard paper.  The number "n" is  a  line     count, figured at 6 lines per inch.   If  this  control     word is not given, "n" is assumed to be 66, for 11-inch     paper..single space     Copy is to be single spaced.  This  mode  takes  effect     after the next  line.    (The  normal  mode  is  single     space.).double space     Copy is to be double spaced.   This mode  takes  effect     after the next line..begin page     Print out this page, start next line on a new page..adjust     Right adjust lines to the  right  margin  by  inserting     blanks in the line.  The next line  is  the  first  one     affected.  (This is the normal mode.).nojust     Do not right-adjust lines..fill     Lengthen short lines by moving words from the following     line; trim long lines by moving words to the  following     line.  (This is the normal mode.)    A  line  beginning     with one or more blanks is taken to be a new paragraph,     and is not run into the previous line.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  11.nofill     Print all lines exactly as they  appear  without  right     adjustment or filling out..page -n-     Print page numbers.  (The first page  is  not  given  a     page number.  It has instead  a  two-inch  top  margin.     See also "Manuscript Conventions", below.)  If  "n"  is     present, insert a page break and number the  next  page     "n".  Note that RUNOFF does not print completely  empty     pages..space -n-     Insert "n" vertical spaces (carriage  returns)  in  the     copy.  If "n" carries spacing to the bottom of a  page,     spacing is stopped.  If "n" is absent or 0,  one  space     is inserted..header xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     All of the line after the first  blank  is  used  as  a     header line, and appears at the top of each page, along     with the page number, if specified..break     The lines before and after the  ".break"  control  word     will  not  be  run  together  by  the  "fill"  mode  of     operation..center     The following line is to be centered between  the  left     and right margins..literal     The following line is not a control word,  despite  the     fact that it begins with a period..heading mode P     This control sequence alters the mode  of  the  running     head to that specified by the parameter "P".    Any  of     the following parameters are allowed:       CENTER  The header will be centered on the page.       MARGIN  The header will be adjusted against the right               margin of the page.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  12       FACING  On even-numbered pages, the  header  will  be               adjusted against  the  left  margin,  on  odd               numbered pages against the right.      OPPOSED  The  header  will  be  adjusted  against  the               opposite margin from the page number.          In   the   absence  of  a  .HEADING  MODE  control          sequence, the default option is OPPOSED..odd page     This control word causes the current page to be printed     out, and the next page to be  numbered  with  the  next     higher odd page number..paging mode P1 P2 ... Pn     This     control  sequence  alters  the  mode  of  page     numbering to that specified by the  parameter  P1,  P2,     etc.  The P1's may be in any order, and  selected  from     the following list:       MARGIN  Page numbers will  be  adjusted  against  the               right margin.       FACING  Odd page numbers  are  adjusted  against  the               right margin, even page numbers are  adjusted               against the left margin.       CENTER  Page numbers are centered between  the  right                and left margin.          TOP  Page numbers are placed on  the  fourth  line               from the top of the page.       BOTTOM  Page numbers are placed on  the  fourth  line               from the bottom of the page.          OFF  Page numbers are discontinued.       PREFIX "string"  The  string  of  characters  between               quotation  marks  is  prefixed  to  the  page               number.  The quotation marks may be  next  to               each other, in which case no prefix is used.       ROMANU  Page numbers will be printed  in  upper  case               Roman numerals.       ROMANL  Page numbers will be printed  in  lower  case               Roman numerals.       ARABIC  Page  numbers  will  be  printed  in  Arabic.               (This is the normal mode.)    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  13        SET n  Set the next page number to be "n".       SKIP n  Skip "n" page numbers.     If in a single use of .PAGING MODE several pi's specify     competing  functions,  the  last  one  specified  takes     precedence.  When the .PAGING MODE sequence appears  in     text at point A, all text up to A  (and  probably  some     text after A) will appear on a page controlled  by  the     previous paging mode.  The new paging  mode  will  take     effect on the next page.  Then there  is no  danger  of     getting page numbers both at the top and bottom of  the     same page.     Use of the TOP parameter may conflict with the  heading     mode.  If a heading and a page number should be printed     in   the   same  column,  the  page  number  will  take     precedence.     In the absence of a .PAGING MODE control sequence,  the     default options are: TOP MARGIN PREFIX "PAGE".append A     Take as the next input line the first line of A (MEMO).     Note that the whole of A  is  appended,  and  that  the     appending is an irreversible process -  that  is,  once     RUNOFF encounters the  .APPEND  control  word  it  will     switch to file A (MEMO) and  continue  from  its  first     line. Other text in the original file (which  contained     the control word) will not be processed by RUNOFF.  The     file A (MEMO) may, of course, itself call for appending     of still another file, and so on.All control words may be typed in either upper case or lowercase.  Illegal control  words  are  ignored  by  the  RUNOFFcommand.  A comment may appear to the  right  of  a  controlword, as long as it is on the same line.<BR><BR><u>Abbreviations</u>All control words may be abbreviated if desired.  A list  ofabbreviations is given in the summary.   In  most  cases,  asingle word is abbreviated by giving its first two  letters;two words are abbreviated by giving the first letter of eachword.<BR><BR><BR><u>Manuscript Conventions</u>The RUNOFF program assumes a page length of 11 inches,  with6 vertical lines per inch. The top and bottom margins are  1inch, except for the first  page  which  has  a  2-inch  topmargin.  If a header is used, it will  be  placed  1/2  inch    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  14from the top of the page.  The first page is  not  numbered,nor is it given the header line, unless  the  control  words".header" and ".page 1" appear  before  the  first  line  oftext.Customary margins are 1-1/2 inches on the left and 1 inch onthe right, implying  a  60-character  line.    This  is  thestandard line length in the absence of margin control words.Unless restrained from doing so by NOWAIT, the program stopsbefore the first page  for  loading  of  paper.    The  STOPparameter will cause a stop between all pages.    The  papershould be loaded so that after  the  first  carriage  returntyping would take place on line 1 of the paper.    The  leftmargin stop of the typewriter should be placed at the  pointtyping will begin, and the right margin moved as  far  rightas possible.  Now, when you type the first carriage  return,the program will start typing and <u>continue</u> to the end of thefile.<BR><BR><BR><u>Tabs</u>When performing right-adjustment, the  RUNOFF  command  doesnot   take  special  account  of  the  tabulate  characters.Therefore, tabs should not be used  unless  "fill"  mode  isoff.  If tabs on a 1050 are not set  at  the  CTSS  standard  *settings of 11, 21, 31, etc.,  the  supervisor  may  mistimecharacters or insert  extra  carriage  returns.    For  thisreason, use of tab characters is not recommended.If a memo does use tabs in a section where  "fill"  is  off,the mechanical tab stops  on  the  typewriter  must  be  setproperly.  The following conventions should be used  in  anymemo which uses tabs:  The  first  two  lines  of  the  memoshould contain two comments, beginning with the words  ".SETTABS AT", followed by a string of blanks and x's,  with  thex's positioned at the  desired  tab  stop  positions.    Thesecond comment should be ".TABS SET AT" followed by a stringof tabs and x's. If the typewriter is correctly set up,  thetypset request "PRINT 3" will cause  the  two  lines  to  beprinted out with the x's lined up.    Since  the  supervisor  *assumes that tab stops are at 11, 21, 31, etc., a line  withtoo many tab characters may appear to overflow the  carriagesize, and the supervisor may insert extra returns.<BR><BR><BR><u>Backspacing</u>Underlining or overtyping may be accomplished with  the  aidof the backspace key, even in a  line  that  is  subject  toright adjustment.    CTSS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE     Section AH.9.01    12/66  15              Summary of RUNOFF Control Words<BR><BR><BR><u>abbrev.</u>        <u>control</u> <u>word</u>             <u>automatic</u> <u>break</u> .ap           .append A                     no .11           .line length n                no .pl           .paper length n               no .in           .indent n                     no .un           .undent n                     yes .ss           .single space                 yes .ds           .double space                 yes .bp           .begin page                   yes .ad           .adjust                       yes  .fl           .fill                         yes .nf           .nofill                       yes .pa           .page (n)                   yes, if n .sp           .space (n)                    yes .he           .header xxxx                  no .br           .break                        yes .ce           .center                       yes .11           .literal                      no .hm           .heading mode P               no .op           .odd page                     yes .pm           .paging mode P                noIf "automatic break" is yes, the lines before and after  thecontrol word will never be run together,  and  the  previousline will be printed out in its entirety before the  controlword takes effect.                                                             (END)</PRE>
