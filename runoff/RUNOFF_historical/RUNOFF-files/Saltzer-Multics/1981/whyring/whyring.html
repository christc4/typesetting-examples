     In a world increasingly populated with Ethernets and Ethernet-like
nets there nevertheless continues to be a strong interest in rings of
active repeaters for local data communication.  This paper explores
some of the engineering problems involved in designing a ring
that has no central control.  It then compares one ring design
with the Ethernet on several different operational and subtle technical points
of
design, maintainability, and future prospects.
On each of these points the ring possesses important or interesting advantages.
At the same time, the most commonly cited advantage of a ring,
"deterministic access time," is shown to be illusory.  The paper concludes
that the data communication ring is a sound idea that will prove its
value on operational rather than theoretical issues.

<H3>Introduction</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
    The M.I.T. Laboratory for Computer Science has, for more than three years,
operated a prototype one Mbit/sec. distributed control ring network of eight
nodes.  About one year ago, the laboratory installed an improved, simpler,
and now commercially available,
ten Mbit/sec. ring design, intended to link groups of up to 250
desktop computers.  Since there are already several competing local network
designs
that use contention-controlled broadcast on passive coaxial cable rather than a
repeater ring, we are
often asked why one should bother to develop an alternative approach--the
contention-controlled broadcast technology is field proven, its properties are
well
understood and adequate for the application.
In addition, there are at least three difficult engineering problems
involved in the design of a distributed control ring network:
reliability of the repeater string, distributed initialization and
recovery, and closed-loop clock coordination.
Of course the ring approach has also been
field-proven in the forms both of laboratory developments [1,2,3], and
commercial products [4,5], but in no case in a way that settles all the
questions.
Upon analysis, it appears that an apparent preference for contention-controlled
broadcast
networks in the United States but for ring networks in Europe has been
more determined by accidental historical precedents than by
persuasive technical arguments.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     This paper examines briefly nine technical differences between the
contention-controlled
broadcast approach and the ring, and argues that it is interesting to
pursue the ring technology.  It assumes that the reader is familiar with the
basic concepts involved in local networks and in ring networks as described
in published papers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
There are a wide variety of possible designs both for rings and for
broadcast networks, and these design choices have both gross and subtle
differences that affect comparisons.
To be specific, the kind of ring network assumed in this discussion is a
token-controlled
system in which the originator removes his own message and in which
there is no central control or monitor station.  Both the one and ten
Mbit/sec. rings at M.I.T. mentioned earlier, as well as the IBM Z-ring [3],
are of this design.
For contrast, the Ethernet local communication network developed
by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center will be used, with the understanding
that it is typical of a contention-controlled passive coaxial cable broadcast
design [8,9,10].
The Mitre Corporation MITREBUS [11], another contention-controlled broadcast
design, is mentioned for
comparison also.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     These specific designs are chosen because they reflect two distinct
and important design choices:
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .in 8 -->
<ul>
</center>
<!-- .un 3 -->

-  access control by contention (Ethernet) versus token (ring), and

<!-- .un 3 -->

-  communication by broadcast (Ethernet) versus point-to-point (ring).
</center>
<!-- .in 0 -->
</ul>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
As shall be seen, the nine technical differences discussed all flow directly
from these two choices.  This point should be kept in mind when applying
the observations to other local network designs that use a different
combination of design choices, for example, a token-controlled broadcast
net or a contention-controlled ring.

<H3>Ring design problems</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     The three difficult ring engineering problems referred to above appear
to have elegant and straightforward solutions, and one of the reasons
for trying out ring technology in the field is to verify that these
solutions work well in practice.  Other papers [2,12,13,14] explore these three
engineering problems and considerations in their solution in some depth, so
they are only summarized here:
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .in 5 -->
<ul>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

1.   Reliability of the repeater string.  The basic problem here is that
a failure in any one repeater can disrupt the entire local network and, if
one strings together one hundred or more active repeaters, one would
expect to end up with a very fragile system.
Further, locating
the troublesome repeater could require perambulation of the entire network.
Very reliable repeaters and careful system engineering seem to be needed
at first glance.  However, a simpler
solution to these problems is to arrange the transmission links between
successive
nodes so that each internode link loops through a central point, a wire center.
At the wire center, bypass relays that are energized remotely by
the network stations can do a majority of the reconfiguration
operations automatically.
The resulting configuration, a star-shaped ring, creates a centralized
location for maintenance and reconfiguration and at the same time provides
reliability, without compromising
the distributed nature of the ring control.
Further, clusters of nodes can be connected by nearby wire centers that are
in turn connected hierarchically through more distant wire centers.
This approach reduces the wiring cost that one might anticipate in a
star topology.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

2.   Distributed initialization and recovery.  To avoid designating some one
ring
node as special (and thereby making ring operation depend on that node's
continued good health) some algorithm is required whereby all active repeaters
can quickly and simply agree upon the need for initialization and recovery,
and not fall all over one another trying to accomplish it.  A suitable
strategy can be devised using two ideas developed for passive broadcast
networks.  First, when any node detects ring trouble, it jams (as in Ethernet)
the ring net with a characteristic signal that insures agreement among all
participants.  Second, after jamming, a virtual token, whose time of arrival
is based on the station's address (as in the Chaosnet [15],) determines which
single
station actually performs network reinitialization.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

3.   Closed-loop clock coordination.  A subtle problem of 
distributed agreement on data transmission rate arises in a ring.
The issue is that not only must the collection of repeaters agree on a
common clock rate, but that clock rate must result in an integral
number of bit times of delay when traversing the closed ring.
Fortunately, there appear to be at least three different, workable ways of
achieving this agreement.  The simplest of these ways is to
open the ring when originating a message, and thereby allow all non-originating
repeaters simply to track the originator.
An intermediate approach based on inserting time wedges in the clock at
repeaters that fall behind the fastest repeater was used in the prototype
ring [6].  The most sophisticated approach is to have a
phase-locked-loop in each repeater tracking its preceding neighbor, and design
loop filters so that the resulting ring of PLL's is stable [14].
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .in 0 -->
</ul>
     These three problems are, of course, problems only until they are solved.
Since good solutions appear to be in hand,
the following discussion assumes that the ring design being
compared with the Ethernet includes the star topology, automatic
decentralized reinitialization, and any one of the clock coordination
techniques.

<H3>Nine points of comparison of rings with Ethernets</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
1.   The contention-controlled broadcast net has a significant analog
engineering component,
while the ring net is almost entirely a digital
design.  This difference looks very interesting to explore, because of its
possible ramifications in ability to exploit rapidly advancing
progress in digital technology and VLSI.  To understand this difference,
consider that a broadcast net transmitter's signal
must be receivable by all receivers on the
cable.  These receivers are at varying distances from the transmitter and
therefore will experience different attenuations and echoes.  Similarly
each receiver must be able to hear every transmitter.  In all, there are N(N-1) 
such combinations that must work in an N-node network, and the transceiver
system must be designed conservatively enough that the worst possible
receiver-transmitter placement combination (in terms of echo buildup
and attenuation) must deliver acceptable performance.
The analog noise level contributed by idle transmitters grows with
the number of nodes, though probably less than linearly.
Finally, in order
for a "listen-while-transmit" collision detection feature of an Ethernet
to work, an active transceiver must be
able to notice that it is not the only active one.  Thus the
receiver part must be capable of detecting the weakest other transmitter
during its own transmissions and distinguishing
that other transmitter from its own transmitter's echoes.
This set of requirements is not impossible to meet, but 
very careful analog transmission system engineering is needed, and the
resulting design has many analog components.
In contrast, the analog part of a ring network repeater is more tractable.
Any given transmitter sends a signal down a private line to
only one receiver.  The receiver has one echo environment and one received
signal level to cope with.  Thus, a relatively simple line driver/line
receiver combination can suffice.  For this reason, the passive broadcast
technology is straining to reach a 10 Mbit/sec. signalling rate with
a 200 node net, while the ring can operate at that speed and scale with a fairly
elementary analog system.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     While engineering in the analog domain is
substantially easier in the ring, in the digital domain the
situation reverses.  Note that two of the three difficult ring engineering
problems discussed earlier (initialization and clock coordination) can be
handled by techniques that are mostly digital.
This difference in the character of the hard
engineering problems of the two technologies offers an exploitation
opportunity that may favor the ring network.  The recent and projected
waves of technology improvement have benefited the digital domain
more than the analog, mostly because it is easy to see how to
solve problems systematically by increasing digital component count; it often
seems to be harder to take systematic advantage of increased numbers of
components in the analog domain.  A less compelling, but still interesting,
argument is that because of the simple analog transmission system
required by the ring, even the line drivers and receivers might be
integrable into a future VLSI implementation; it is probably harder to do
this integration for the more complex analog transceiver technology of the
passive broadcast net.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
2.   A problem with the Ethernet that is closely related to its analog
domain engineering emphasis lies in ground reference and power supply.  It
is important that a local network not impose a uniform ground reference
on all attached hosts.  If it did, the network risks carrying large ground
currents or creating ground loops.  In order to obtain acceptable transceiver
performance in a broadcast environment,
all present Ethernet designs seem to require direct coupling of
an active component (e.g., the base of a transistor) to the cable, with
consequent need for a power supply whose ground reference is the cable
shield.  To avoid adding a central, shared component, a per-node, isolated
power supply for the active part of the transceiver electronics seems to be a
requirement of
an Ethernet.  The ring, on the other hand, can be designed to deliver
enough energy that ground isolation can be achieved in the signal path ahead
of the first active component of the receiver.  (The prototype M.I.T. ring used
optical
isolators for this purpose; the ten Mbit/sec. ring uses pulse transformers.)
Finally, because sensitive, active electronic components are directly attached
to
the Ethernet coaxial cable conductors, transient suppression (e.g., from
lightning)
requires that the coaxial cable ground shield system be grounded at no more
than one point.  (To enforce this requirement whle maintaining the ability to
divide a long cable into sections for trouble shooting, the initial Ethernet 
specification [10] required
that there be <i>no</i> ground for the cable.  Such a floating
conductive system becomes a personnel hazard in the case in which it
accidentally becomes shorted to an electric power conductor.)
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
3.   Electromagnetic compatibility between the net and other physically
adjacent electrical equipment is generally easier to engineer with a
balanced transmission medium than with an unbalanced one.  One of
the attractions of the Ethernet is the ease of attaching to it at
any point, which ease relies on the use of clamp-on connectors with coaxial
cable, an unbalanced
medium.  If one tried to use a balanced transmission medium for the
Ethernet, it would probably become necessary to install ordinary connectors
every time a new node is added, and the easy attachment virtue would be
compromised.
In addition, the Ethernet strategy of listening for collisions
depends on the transmitter generating an average DC level.  Collision detection
with balanced lines would
probably become more complex,
since in the most obvious balanced waveform modulation schemes the average DC
level is zero.
In contrast, the ring
network can use shielded twisted
pair and balanced waveform modulation, thereby reducing both radiation
to other equipment and susceptibility of the network to noise spikes
and electrical interference originating elsewhere.  At the same
time, the passive star arrangement for a ring captures much of the easy
attachment property.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
4.   An attraction of the passive broadcast net is the intrinsic high
reliability
that comes from having a minimum number of active components whose
failure can disrupt the net.  The most important shared component--the
coaxial cable--is completely passive.  In contrast, the primary
objection to a ring network is the operational fragility of a
series string of 100 or more repeaters.  However, this fragility
disappears when using the passive star arrangement of
the ring network.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
5.   Another attraction of the passive broadcast net is that it is exceptionally
easy
to install--a single cable is routed through the building, near
every office or other location in which a network node might be needed.
Actual attachment of nodes can be deferred until the node is required,
at which time attachment can be accomplished by clamp-on connectors;
attachment does not disrupt network operation.  However, hand-in-hand
with this convenience goes an associated inconvenience, namely that
trouble isolation and first-aid repair cannot easily be centralized.
Some kinds of failures will require foot-by-foot inspection of the
network and each node attachment, involving access to offices
and other spaces
throughout the building.  The passive star configuration of the ring network
completely overcomes this potential problem.
With a passive star, addition of a new station involves running a cable
from the office to a nearby wire center, so one might consider wiring a building
in advance by running one such cable per office.  Then, installation of a
station is done by attaching a connector and plugging it in.  No extra
disruption is associated with this kind of installation.
Further, many buildings are already designed with cable trays and wire ducts
in place that emanate from a wire center, because both telephone and
electric power wiring practice also call for wire centers.
Field experience with both kinds of networks is really required to
determine which is more effective on day-to-day operational issues such as
this and the previous two.
Such experience is being reported for the Ethernet [9,16]; corresponding
experience with a ring is not yet so extensive.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
6.   There is an intrinsic limitation in the contention-controlled broadcast net
approach in its
ability to make effective use of higher speed transmission media,
such as optical fibers.
In a contention network,
at the beginning of each packet transmission there is a period when there
is a risk of collision:  this period is proportional to the length of the
transmission medium, since the packet is exposed to
collision until its first bit propagates to the farthest transceiver.
The duration of this exposure is thus fixed by the physical configuration.
As the transmission speed increases, the time required to transmit an average
size packet decreases, until at some transmission rate the packet transmission
time becomes
as short as the cable propagation time.  At that point, most
of the advantage of carrier
sense is lost and the system becomes an ordinary Aloha channel, with
an intrinsic data capacity limit of about 18% of the channel capacity [3,17].
For a 1 Km. coaxial cable, the end-to-end propagation time is typically 4500
nsec.
This is comparable to the time required to transmit a 60-octet packet at
100 Mbit/sec.  Thus an attempt to build a 100 Mbit/sec. passive broadcast net
might result
in an effective performance limit near 20 Mbit/sec.  The ring, because it
does not use a contention access scheme, does not have any corresponding
limiting effect, and thus can be scaled up directly to a 100 Mbit/sec.
configuration.
(The importance of this limitation in contention-controlled nets depends
critically on
the distribution of packet sizes.  If most packets are 6000, rather than 60,
octets in length the limitation would be inconsequential at a 100 Mbit/sec.
rate.
One can make a good argument that any application that requires a
100 Mbit/sec. transmission rate for 100 nodes will not typically generate
small packets because of per-packet software overhead, so there should be an
opportunity
to avoid the Aloha phenomenon.  Until some more
experience is gained with applications that really require this
bandwidth, the question will remain unanswered.  Experience with the
Hyperchannel [18] network, which is a contention-controlled net
that runs at 50 Mbit/sec., may be useful in this regard.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
7.   A second limitation of the passive broadcast net approach that appears to
require some considerable ingenuity to overcome is to
take advantage of fiber optic technology.  This technology offers the
attraction of very high speed, excellent electromagnetic compatibility,
avoidance of lightning and ground reference problems, and (predicted) low cost.
However, the problems of turning optical fiber into a broadcast medium 
are formidable.  One must invent a satisfactory technique for tapping an optical
fiber and detecting a signal without diverting too much optical energy or
else the system will not scale up very well in number of nodes.  Yet the
same tap must allow introducing a new signal without loss.
(Some recent experiments with many-tailed star couplers are promising, but that
approach
gives up the single cable routed by every office that is one of the
chief attractions of the Ethernet [19].)  In
contrast, since a ring network uses one-way, point-to-point transmission,
replacing the wire links in a ring network with fiber optic links is
quite straightforward.
The Cambridge ring has operated for some time with one fiber optic link [1].
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .in 0 -->
</ul>
8.   Because it uses repeaters, a ring network can with ease span much
greater physical distances than can the passive broadcast net.  The
passive broadcast net can also be augmented with repeaters, as in the
Ethernet standard and the Mitrebus.  However, use of contention
control, which makes the propagation time between the two most widely
separated stations a critical, performance-limiting parameter, limits the
distance that one can extend a broadcast net even with repeaters.
Since in order to arrange a ring to span a longer distance at least
parts of it must be "stretched out" rather than fully looped back in a
passive star, one trades away some maintenance ease to gain a
greater geographical span.  Thus the contention-controlled broadcast
net trades both performance and maintenance ease with increased
geographical coverage, while the ring trades only maintenance ease.
The distance spanning effect is quite substantial, for two reasons.
First, when using comparably expensive driver, receiver, and cable
technology, a single ring link, being point-to-point rather than
broadcast, can be longer than a single broadcast cable segment.
Second, when successive ring links are placed in tandem the
maximum geographical span is multiplied by half the number of stations--perhaps
a factor of 100.  Thus for an area such as a campus of a
</center>
<!-- .bp -->
hundred buildings
and building wings, a ring may have a considerable advantage over a
passive broadcast network.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .in 0 -->
</ul>
9.   A final, practical question to consider is whether or not there might be
anything about a ring network that intrinsically requires either more or
less complex logic than a contention-controlled broadcast network.  Only
examination
of in-field designs can answer this question, but such examination is trickier
than one might expect, because every local net designer seems to have
chosen a different function packaging approach.  Thus one design
includes packet buffers, another doesn't but includes a direct memory
access channel for some popular computer bus, the next assumes that part
of the network control will be handled by software rather than hardware.
To compare more carefully, implementations in medium-scale integration for the
experimental Ethernet,
the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Chaosnet, and the ten
Mbit/sec. ring network were compared by measuring the board area required to
hold
the implementation of the network control logic up to but not
including speed-matching buffers.  All three were found to require something
less than 50 square inches of densely packed wire-wrap card.
Casual observation of the
implementation of a Mitrebus interface and a Prime Computer ring net
controller suggested that these two network designs were similar in
complexity to the others.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
    The conclusion is that there is
no significant intrinsic difference in the complexity of implementation
of the two approaches, and a straightforward TTL implementation
of a ring network should require about the same amount
of hardware as an equivalent function contention-controlled broadcast net
operating at the same speed.
(This comparison of hardware complexity is distinct from that of point one,
earlier, which raised some questions about the ease of VLSI implementation
of the analog components of the broadcast network.)
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .ce -->

<H3>Non-determinism</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     A sometimes-mentioned point of difference between token control as used
in the ring and contention control as used in the Ethernet is the ability
to predict the maximum time one must wait to obtain access.
Superficially, it appears that a carefully-designed token control net
could have an advantage here.  If one limits the maximum message length,
and insists that the token must be passed along after sending one message,
then every network user has a guarantee that the token makes steady progress,
and one can calculate with confidence the maximum length of time one might
have to wait for access.  In contrast, in the case of the Ethernet,
since every attempt to transmit could in principle produce a collision,
there is a worrisome possibility that one could go on engaging in
collisions indefinitely.  Such a possibility would be of concern, for
example, in a distributed real-time process control application in which
a deadline might be missed.  This property is sometimes summarized by saying
that the Ethernet is "non-deterministic".
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     That analysis is, however, superficial, because it omits a real-world
consideration that intervenes to make the contention network
and the token network much more similar than one might expect.  In any network,
no matter how access is controlled. there is a finite probability of
transmission
error.  In a token-controlled ring, an error may destroy the token at the
worst possible time, or when a station nearing a deadline finally receives
the token the message it sends may be damaged by an error, and retransmission
may be needed.  Thus the prospective recipient of the message can find that the
deadline has been missed; the token ring is non-deterministic, too.
One must accept the fact that the real world provides no guarantees, only
a probability of success.  Once that principle is clear, one can specify
a required success probability and choose system parameters accordingly.
However, this approach applies equally well to the token and contention
networks.
Given a required probability of successfully meeting a deadline, one can
calculate immediately a loading level for an Ethernet that meets the
deadline with more than the required probability in the face of contention.
The rest of the system must, of course, be designed to insure that the
intended Ethernet load is not exceeded, either absolutely or else with a
probability consistent with the system success goal.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     The numbers that result can be quite practical.  For
example, in a 50-node ring, one must plan to wait for as many as
50 maximum length messages to be sent until the token
arrives.  The probability that an Ethernet is busy for n or more successive
message intervals when it is loaded to a fraction of its capacity
r (r&lt;1, exponential message arrivals, fixed message length)
is approximately r .  For r = 0.5 (a 50% loaded network) the
probability that a wait of more the 50 message intervals occurs
is thus less than about 10   , probably 5 orders of magnitude smaller
than the probability of a transmission error that calls for retry
or reinitialization.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     In practice there is one more level of subtlety to this line of argument.
Suppose we have designed both an Ethernet and a ringnet for a time-critical
application, and have determined the error rates on both nets and the
maximum allowed load on the Ethernet so that the chance of missing the
deadline is acceptably small.  In the case of a token-controlled ring, if
any host attempts to present an abnormal traffic load to
the network, the token-control mechanism effectively throttles the runaway host,
and other network participants still have their usual chance of meeting
their deadlines.  In the contention-controlled Ethernet, an abnormally active
host can increase the probability of contention and thereby lower the
chance of meeting deadlines.  This difference represents a genuine
advantage of the token ring.  But if the system is correctly designed,
this effect must be second order, when
one considers that any single host is normally throttled internally by
software overhead anyway.  One might hypothesize a conspiracy
of several runaway nodes, but such a hypothesis takes us
into the realm of predictably low-probability events.
(One can also argue about whether incorrectly designed Ethernets
fail more spectacularly than incorrectly designed token rings, but
that somehow seems to be an uninteresting discussion.)
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     Thus it appears to us that non-determinism is an
unimportant difference between the contention system and the token approach.

<H3>Broadband</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     A related idea is that of using
radio frequency broadcast signalling on coaxial cable ("Broadband") as, for
example,
the Mitre Corporation has done [11].  In these systems, both broadcast
and contention control of access are used, so this scheme boils down to
translating
an Ethernet from baseband to some carrier frequency.  It thus has most of the
same
attractions and disadvantages of the Ethernet, but with three extra appeals:
</center>
<!-- .in 5 -->
<ul>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

a)   The same coaxial cable can also carry other radio frequency signals
with different purposes, for example cable television.  Thus bringing the data
network into an office would automatically bring the CATV system there, too.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

b)   The coaxial cable is used in a frequency range where there is less
dispersion
(change of propagation velocity with frequency) so a greater bandwidth
can be obtained.
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
</center>
<!-- .un 5 -->

c)   The cable television industry has developed a useful collection
of modestly priced components, including cable attachment hardware
and radio frequency linear integrated circuits that one could exploit.
In particular, high bandwidth, low delay analog repeaters are available
at a modest price; this availability leads to more uniform, higher signal
levels.  Higher signal levels in turn allow simpler analog design and
ground isolation techniques to be used.
</center>
<!-- .in 0 -->
</ul>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
The radio frequency signalling approach, however, ends up with the same kind
of large analog engineering component as does the Ethernet-type broadcast net,
this time in the
form of wide-band linear amplifiers, voltage controlled oscillators, filters,
modems, and phase-locked loops.  Although there are available integrated
circuits that help
perform those functions, in real applications those circuits must be surrounded
by additional analog components--capacitors, resistors, transformers, etc.
In exploiting
cable television industry developments, one misses the opportunity
to exploit what may be even more potent (by reason of volume and potential
total integration) economic forces in the digital logic area.
Finally, if one tries to make use of the potential for higher bandwidth it
turns out that one cannot so easily take advantage of the television
industry chips.  But if one uses discrete
components, the cost climbs substantially.

     Apart from these considerations, the broadband network is an example
of a contention-controlled broadcast system, so the earlier technical
comparisons with the token-controlled ring seem to apply to it also.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
</center>
<!-- .sp -->
<p>
     Considering these various technical arguments, it appears that one
cannot make a clear case for either the contention-controlled broadcast net or
the ring
technologies.  Both approaches have good arguments
in their favor, and it is likely that operational issues such as ease of
installation, maintenance, and administration will dominate the detailed
technical issues.  Thus practical experience with 100-node ring networks
is really required to establish concrete comparisons of reliability and
ease of maintenance and reconfiguration in the field.  The answer
to the question asked in the opening paragraph is that there seems to be
substantial technical interest in continuing to pursue ring technology.

     A second conclusion concerns the development and use of standards for local
networks,
such as the Ethernet standard of Xerox, Intel,
Digital Equipment Corporation [10], and the IEEE Project 802
proposed standards. [20]  With the current state of understanding
and with substantial technical issues still to be resolved, it is clear that
such standards
cannot provide guidance on the choice of local network technology
for a particular application; they can only provide guidance on how to
implement a particular technology.  Separate standards are required for
bus and ring technologies,
just as separate standards apply to phonograph records and magnetic
tapes.  In recognition of this requirement, IEEE Project
802 has recently reorganized itself into three parts, concerned respectively
with Ethernet-like networks, token rings, and token buses.

     Finally, the diversity of local network technologies prompts a need for a
network interconnection standard that is technology-independent.  One
approach to such a standard may be found in the fourth part of the IEEE
Project 802 standard--the High-Level Interface (HILI) standard, which
takes a formal, functional approach to specifying a general interface to a
local network.  Another approach, which we believe bears investigation, is to
define an interconnection standard at a hardware level that is
technology-independent, a standard that specifies a common
interface between a local network controller, or access device,
and the hardware that is specific to a host processor's I/O structure.

     This paper is a collection of conclusions and
thoughts developed in conversations over several years with ring and Ethernet
advocates too numerous to identify.  Comments on drafts of this paper by
Butler Lampson and David Reed sharpened up several of the observations.
