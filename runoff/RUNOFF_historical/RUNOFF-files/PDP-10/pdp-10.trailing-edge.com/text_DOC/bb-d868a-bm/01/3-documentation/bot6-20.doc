BOOT.DOC -- Version 6(130)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOT is used to load the TOPS-20 Monitor from disk into  KL10  memory.
On  normal system startup, BOOT is automatically loaded and started by
RSX20F,  and  will  load  the   TOPS-20   Monitor   without   operator
intervention.

BOOT  is  also  responsible  for  dumping  KL10  memory  after  system
malfunction, for later analysis.

BOOT version 6(130) runs with TOPS-20 Release 3.

BOOT is documented in the following documents:

     DECSYSTEM-20 Software Installation Guide
