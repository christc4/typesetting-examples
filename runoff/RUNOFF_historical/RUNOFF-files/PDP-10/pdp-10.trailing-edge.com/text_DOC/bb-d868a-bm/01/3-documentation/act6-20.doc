ACCT20.DOC -- Version 6
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

ACCT20 generates accounting  reports  from  the  data  in  the  System
Accounting  File,  FACT.BIN.   It  serves  as  an  example of relevant
techniques  for  customers  wishing  to  develop  reporting   programs
tailored  to  their own installation.  ACCT20 will not process the new
format USAGE files produced by TOPS20 Release 3.  Refer to the program
CONV20 for information on converting USAGE files to FACT file format.

ACCT20 version 6 only runs on Release 3 of TOPS20.  (Note:  ACCT20  is
a Fortran program.  If you type

     INFORMATION VERSION

after loading ACCT20 into memory, you will get the version  number  of
FOROTS rather than the version of ACCT20.)

ACCT20 is documented in the following documents:

     DECSYSTEM-20 Accounting System Specification.

     DECSYSTEM-20 Operators Guide



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in ACCT20 for Release 3 of TOPS-20.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

ACCT20 can no longer handle disk usage information due to the addition
of multiple structure support.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run ACCT20

ACCT20 consists of one file, ACCT20.EXE.

In addition, PA1050.EXE must be on SYS:

ACCT20  reads  the   contents   of   the   System   Accounting   File,
<ACCOUNTS>FACT.BIN.   This  file  is  usually  renamed  to  the user's
directory prior to running ACCT20.

4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing ACCT20

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 2
     RESTORE <*>ACCT20.EXE (TO) SYS:*.*.-1
     REWIND


4.3  Files Needed to Build ACCT20

ACCT20 is built from the following files:

     ACCT20.FOR
     ACCSUB.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building ACCT20

(Note that FORTRAN must be on SYS:)

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 3
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT ACCT20.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


4.5  Special Considerations

Release 3 is the last Release to  support  ACCT20.   ACCT20  is  being
replaced by USAG20.
