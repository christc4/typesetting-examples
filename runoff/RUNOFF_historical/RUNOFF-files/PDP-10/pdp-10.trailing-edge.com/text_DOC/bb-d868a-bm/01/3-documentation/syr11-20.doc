March 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

SYSERR is a program used to list the  contents  of  the  system  error
file.   It  is the report generating portion of the DECSYSTEM-20 Error
Detection, Recover, and Reporting package.

SYSERR Version 11(614) runs on TOPS20 Version 3.

SYSERR uses HELPER, SCAN, and the compatability package.

Documentation on how to run SYSERR and descriptions of report  formats
may be found in the DECSYSTEM-20 System Error Detection, Recovery, and
Reporting Reference Manual.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

This  release  of  the  SYSERR  package  includes  the  following  new
functions:

     1.  Support 2020 type entries.

     2.  Support RH11/UBA massbus controller.

     3.  Support RM03 disk drives.

     4.  Handles extended length Serial Numbers.

     5.  New summary formats for RH11/UBA and RM03.

     6.  Fixed KLINIK and Network entries.

     7.  Reworked summary routines for Massbus entries.

     8.  Added 'PS:' to default input file definition.

     9.  Reworked /DEV: switch.
