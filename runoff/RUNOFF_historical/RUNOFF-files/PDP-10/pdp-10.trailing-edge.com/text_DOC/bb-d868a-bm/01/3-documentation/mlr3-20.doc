MAILER.DOC -- Changes from V2(4) to V3(6)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

MAILER is a privileged system program which, in cooperation with MAIL,
delivers messages to users.  MAILER ordinarily runs under SYSJOB.

MAILER version 3(6) runs only on Release 3 of TOPS-20.

MAILER depends on the program MAIL  3(4)  and  the  privileged  system
program  INFO  3(4).   Messages  delivered  by  MAILER are read by the
program RDMAIL.

MAILER is not formally documented.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
