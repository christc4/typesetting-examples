FILCOM.DOC -- Changes from 20A(17) to 20B(40)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

The FILCOM program compares two  files  and  outputs  the  differences
between them.

With FILCOM you may compare both ASCII files and binary files.  FILCOM
compares ASCII files line by line and binary files word by word.

FILCOM runs under all releases of TOPS-20.

FILCOM requires the TOPS-10 Compatibility Package (PA1050)  to  reside
on SYS:  to run correctly.

FILCOM is documented in the DECSYSTEM-20 User's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in FILCOM for Release 3.
