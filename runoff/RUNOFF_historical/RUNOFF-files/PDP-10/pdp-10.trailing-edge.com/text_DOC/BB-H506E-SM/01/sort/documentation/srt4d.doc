SRT4D.DOC -- Changes from SORT V4C(467) to V4D(530).



1.0  SUMMARY

1.1  Functions

SORT is the high performance sort/merge package for the  DECSYSTEM-20.
SORT may be run as a stand-alone sort/merge, or embedded in a COBOL or
FORTRAN program.

This release, SORT V4D(530), contains all published edits  up  to  and
including edit 530 and fully replaces SORT V4C.


1.2  Monitor

SORT runs under all supported monitors,  and  has  been  tested  under
Release 6.1 of TOPS-20.

See section 4 for details of how to rebuild SORT.


1.3  Software Dependencies

SORT V4D requires release versions of MONSYM.UNV, MACSYM.UNV and,  for
COBOL, MACREL.REL.  These files are included on the tape.

The internal COBOL-74 SORT  requires  version  12A  or  later  of  the
COBOL-74  object  time system, C74O12.EXE and C74LIB.REL, to reside on
SYS:.

The internal FORTRAN SORT requires the FORTRAN library, FORLIB.REL, to
reside on SYS:.


1.4  Relevant Documentation

SORT is documented in the following manuals:

DECSYSTEM-20 User's Guide, AA-4179B-TM
DECSYSTEM-20 SORT/MERGE User's Guide, AA-4186C-TM
COBOL-74 Language Manual AA-5059A-TK
FORTRAN Reference Manual, AA-4158B-TM
These may be found in Software Notebooks 1, 7, 8, and 9.
SRT4D.DOC                                                       Page 3


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The following switches were added in V4C.  They are not documented.

/NOCRLF
This switch tells SORT that BOTH the input and the  output  files  are
fixed size ASCII records containing no carriage control characters.

/AFTER-ADVANCING and /BEFORE-ADVANCING
These switches tell SORT where the carriage-control characters  go  in
relation  to  the  record.   /AFTER  is the normal way, /BEFORE is the
COBOL-74 compatible way.  These switches affect output  only  as  SORT
can  read  either  format  correctly  and  just  ignore the extraneous
cr-lfs.

/MAX-TEMP-FILES
This switch specifies the maximum number of temporary files  that  can
be used during the SORT or MERGE.


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

.BR No known bugs or deficiencies.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Contents of the SORT Distribution Tape.

For details of the combined COBOL/SORT tape see COBOL.INS.

The SORT distribution tape is written in DUMPER  format  and  contains
the complete SORT/MERGE system.  There are four save sets.

The save sets are:


1.  SORT-DOCUMENTATION

2.  SORT-BINARY

3.  SORT-SOURCE

4.  SORT-BUILD

The SORT-DOCUMENTATION save set contains the following files:

         SORT.BD    -- directory of SORT-BINARY save set
         SORT.SD    -- directory of SORT-SOURCE save set
         SORT.RD    -- directory of SORT-BUILD save set
         SORT.HLP   -- the HELP file for SORT
         SRT4D.BWR  -- the Beware file for SORT 4D
         SRT4D.DOC  -- the Doc file for SORT 4D

The SORT-BINARY save set contains the  files  required  to  run  SORT.
These files are normally kept on SYS:.

The SORT-SOURCE save set contains all the  source  files  required  to
build SORT.

The SORT-BUILD save set contains the Rel, Log, UNV  files  etc.   from
the final build.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing SORT

Mount the SORT or COBOL/SORT tape  on  logical  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

DUMPER
TAPE MTA0:
REWIND
DENSITY 1600-BPI
SKIP 1
RESTORE <*>SORT.EXE <SUBSYS>*.*.-1,-
<*>SORT.HLP <SUBSYS>*.*.-1
REWIND

4.3  Instructions for Building SORT

Full building instructions for SORT can be found in SORT.CTL.

To simplify the build process, all logical names  required  have  been
placed  in  a file called SORT.CMD.  The user should examine this file
and make appropriate changes.  The SORT command file SORT.CTL  does  a
TAKE of SORT.CMD to set up the logical name environment.

To generate stand-alone SORT, load all of  the  SORT-SOURCE  save  set
into SORT-SOURCE:, load SORT.CTL and SORT.CMD from the SORT-BUILD save
set into SORT-BUILD, modify SORT.CMD and type:

     SUBMIT SORT/TIME:0:30:00

If  LIBOL.REL,  LIBSHR.REL,   FTDEFS.UNV   and   METUNV.UNV   are   in
COBOL-68-BUILD:,  a  COBOL-68  SORT  will  be  built and inserted into
LIBO12.EXE and LIBOL.REL.

If  C74LIB.REL,  C74SHR.REL,  FTDEFS.UNV   and   METUNV.UNV   are   in
COBOL-74-BUILD:,  a  COBOL-74  SORT  will  be  built and inserted into
C74O12.EXE and C74LIB.REL.

If FORLIB.REL is in SORT-BUILD:, a FORTRAN  SORT  will  be  built  and
inserted into FORLIB.REL.

To build only a COBOL-68 SORT type:

     SUBMIT SORT/TIME:0:20:00/TAG:COBOL


To build only a COBOL-74 SORT type:

     SUBMIT SORT/TIME:0:20:00/TAG:CBL74


To build only a FORTRAN SORT type:

     SUBMIT SORT/TIME:0:20:00/TAG:FORTRA

The following edits were made to SORT as a result of bugs found:
472          Release core before returning to the calling program.
             TOPS-10 COBOL and FORTRAN SORTs (except FSORT) do not
             release the core they retained before returning to the
             calling program. Make a CBC FUNCT. call for these cases.
             Area Affected: CUTBAK in SORT.MAC
             GCS,24-Nov-81,SPR:10-31747
             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SORT.MAC

473          ?ILL MEM REF can occur when using FSORT.
             SORT's data pages can fail to be created if the physical
             core limit is reached. In this case, attempt to create
             the page on disk. If this would exceed the users virtual
             limit, give an error message.
             GCS,9-Dec-81,SPR:10-31774
             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SRTSTA.MAC

474          Edit necessary when using FSORT with FORTRAN V6.
             Change in initialization Procedure to set up stack
             correctly for version 6 FORTRAN.

475          ?PC out of bounds
             Edit to disallow the /HELP switch when called from
             FORTRAN programs.
             ERD,15-Dec-81,SPR:10-31773
             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SRTSTA.MAC

476          TOPS20 FORTRAN SORT does not resolve the address of the
             passed argument correctly since SORT now runs in section 5.

             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SRTSTA.MAC,SRTCMD.MAC

477          If a FILOP. fails, the wrong error code is sometimes typed.
             This occurs on TOPS-10 only.
             GCS,18-Feb-82,SPR:10-32102
             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SRTUUO.MAC

500          Various errors in collating sequence code.
             The first word of a TOPS-10 collating sequence file is
             missing. Numeric literals in a file fail. Excess code on
             TOPS-20. No test for duplicate characters in file.

             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SRTSTA.MAC,SRTSCN.MAC,SRTJSS.MAC,SRTCER.MAC

501          Illegal memory reference while outputing to a blocked file.
             A test to determine if a BLT is necessary to clear some
             locations was erroneous.

             A:SRC SRTPRM.MAC,SORT.MAC

502          If the PMAP% fails to map pages to the output file because
             the users disk quota is exceeded or the disk is full, then
             make the error message fatal (but continuable) again.

503          A TOPS-10 FORTRAN SORT can go virtual when it shouldn't.
             FOROTS V6 allocates some area, data and stack, above the
             OTS. Fix the way SORT calculates the memory used, so that
             it will include this area.

504          If a long command is given in a FORTRAN SORT(FSORT) call
             which specifies the /COLLATE:FILE:file switch, the error
             "?SCNUOP Unmatched open parenthesis" can occur.
