1.0  SUMMARY

The major changes between COBOL V12B and COBOL V12C are:

Bug fixes (see sec 2.1 through 2.6).

COBOL version 12C consists of:
        CBL74    version 12C(1574)
        C74OTS   version 12C(1141)
        COBDDT   version 12C(47)
        ISAM     version 12C(212)
        LIBARY   version 12C(31)
        RERUN    version 12C(7)

The above software will run on all supported  monitors  and  has  been
tested under TOPS-20 release 4.

COBOL-74 version 12C conforms to the full ANSI  highest  level  except
for:
RPW  It contains ANS-68 Report Writer

See section 3 for known deficiencies.

See COBOL INSTALLATION GUIDE  for  configuration  switch  setting  and
compatibility issues.

1.2  Required Software

The following software or later is required to build COBOL V12C.

     Name           Version
     ----           -------
     MACRO          53A(1173)
     LINK            4A(1220)
     MAKLIB          2A(67)
     MACREL         Release 4
     PA1050         4.1(363)

     Note, this is the official Release 4  PA1050  plus  all  required
     patches.   It is required to run COBOL 12C programs.  Although it
     is not actually required to build COBOL we  recommend  that  this
     version replace the official release 4 version.

3.1                 Deficiencies from COBOL v12 and v12A


     COPY REPLACING has some problems in that it is  not  possible  to
     replace either part of PIC xyz without replacing the whole.
     i.e.  REPLACING ==PIC S9(10)==
     will work
     but
     REPLACING ==PIC== or REPLACING ==S9(10)== will not.

     Note, it was never  the  intent  (and  it  contravenes  the  ANSI
     standard) for COPY REPLACING to replace part of a data-item.
     REPLACING AA by BB should not turn AA-XYZ into BB-XYZ.

     There is currently an incompatibility between TOPS-10 and TOPS-20
     that  causes  a  problem  for  simultaneous update under TOPS-20.
     Under TOPS-10 it is possible to have one program open a file  for
     INPUT  (only)  without  simultaneous  update control while at the
     same time another program is running that opens the same file for
     simultaneous update.  Currently TOPS-20 does not support the open
     mode that allows this, so that the first program to open the file
     will  stop  the  other, with its different mode, from running (it
     will die with an open error).  This incompatibility will  not  be
     addressed by TOPS-20 until a future release.

     We do not recommend that this change  be  installed  unless  your

     The ASCII to EBCDIC translation table was changed in  version  12
     (as  the  result  of  several  SPRs)  so  that the translation of
     graphics was more correct.   However  it  is  still  not  correct
     according  to  IBM  documentation, we are currently investigating
     wha t VAX does to see if there can be a DEC to  IBM  standard  we
     can  live  with.   However  it  seems  that  we now in some cases
     generate incorrect EBCDIC characters for minus zero.  The interim
     solution for those who see this problem is to put the translation
     t able back the way it was in version 11 knowing  then  that  the
     translation of some graphics will be wrong.

3.2                 Deficiencies from before COBOL v12


     Program ID same as filename, procedure name or data name  results
     in spurious error messages.

     If A=B and C=D or E for subscripted A and  C  gives  wrong  code,
     cause "SUBSCRIPT not POSITIVE" run time message if subscripts not
     COMP or INDEX.

     Error not detected.
     A RESET FINAL clause is legitimate only when FINAL is given as  a
     control.   Violation  of  this  rule  goes  undiagnosed.  A RESET
     clause  can  only  accompany  a  sum  clause.   A  RESET   clause
     accompanying a source clause receives no diagnostic.

     Incorrect error message.
     DATA-NAME RC which is defined on last line of the working-storage
     section is incorrectly diagnosed as undefined in the declaratives
     area of procedure division.  It is considered to be defined ok in
     the report section, however.

     Incorrect error message.
     COBOL rules make the presence of  a  data-name  optional  in  the
     control  footing  report description provided there is no need to
     reference the report group.  In the case where the  data-name  is
     present  the  program  compiles without error.  In the case where
     the data name is not present the compiler seems to be disallowing
     sections in the procedure division.

     DBMS error handling
     Errors which relate to the schema are not tabulated in the  error
     count, and they go only to the TTY.

     If "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON x" where x is  "INPUT",  "OUTPUT
     or  "I-O"  and  "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON file-name" are both
     specified, then file-name may not be OPENed for x.

     User error is not diagnosed:  When the value of an 88-level  item
     is  not the correct class, and the item is subordinate to a group
     item which has the clause "USAGE INDEX", the program will compile
     without an error diagnostic.

3.3                 SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE:


     Because of a problem in the TOPS-20 monitor, records updated in a
     file  via  SMU  mode  which  cause  the  length of the file to be
     extended by one program will not be found by  other  users  until
     both  programs  close  and  reopen  the  file.   To overcome this
     restriction for ISAM files, the ISAM utility sets the  file  size
     for  .IDX  and  .IDA  files  to  +infinity (2**35 -1) in the file
     descriptor block (FDB).  Please  note  that  the  files  physical
     length  is  the correct number of bytes written.  The file's size
     in pages is displayed correctly by VDIRECTORY.

     This fix allows simultaneous update users to process  ISAM  files
     correctly.   However  some  programs or TOPS-20 commands (such as
     FILCOM or QUEUE LPT:  = FILE/PRINT:OCTAL) which attempt to access
     the file sequentially will run improperly - they will run and run
     and run...

     A special purpose utility SETEOF.EXE is included  in  the  BINARY
     save  set.  SETEOF may be used to extend the file size in the FDB
     to a large, user specified size or  to  reduce  a  file  with  an
     extended file size to the actual file size (rounded upward to the
     next  page).   This  will  allow  users  of   random   files   in
     simultaneous   update   mode  to  extend  the  file  size  before
     processing.  Conversely, if a user wishes to sequentially process
     a  file  with  an extended file size, the user may use SETEOF and
     specify a file size of "0" to reduce the file to the actual  file
     size (rounded upward to the next page).
