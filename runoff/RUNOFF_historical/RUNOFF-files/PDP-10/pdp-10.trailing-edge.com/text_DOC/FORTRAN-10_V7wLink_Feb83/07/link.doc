1.0  INTRODUCTION



LINK is the linking loader for the DECsystem-10.   LINK  5.1
is a development release of LINK for the DECsystem-10.  This
version includes a number of new features, internal changes,
and bug fixes.

LINK 5.1 supercedes all previous versions.   It  runs  under
all  supported  monitors,  and has been tested under TOPS-10
7.01A.

LINK is documented  in  the  LINK  Reference  Manual.   This
manual  is  available  as  part  of volume 11 of the TOPS-10
Software  Notebooks,   or   separately   as   order   number
AA-0988C-TB.




2.0  INSTALLATION


To install LINK the following files must be moved onto SYS:


     1.  LINK.EXE

     2.  LNKSCN.EXE

     3.  LNKLOD.EXE

     4.  LNKMAP.EXE

     5.  LNKXIT.EXE

     6.  LNKOV1.EXE

     7.  LNKOV2.EXE

     8.  LNKERR.EXE

     9.  LNK999.EXE

    10.  OVRLAY.REL


The LINK.HLP and LINK.DOC  files  should  be  moved  to  the
system directories HLP:  and DOC:  respectively.

3.0  REBUILDING LINK


All the files required to rebuild LINK are included  on  the
tape:   sources,  command  files,  and  a control file.  The
control  file  LINK.CTL  reassembles  the  LINK  and  OVRLAY
modules  and  re-links LINK.  It requires a time limit of 20
minutes.  KS installations may require more time.

Note that in the future LINK patches will be distributed via
AUTOPATCH.  This procedure requires a set of unmodified LINK
sources.  It is recommended that an unmodified set  of  LINK
sources  be  preserved if maintenance edits or site-specific
enhancements are made.



4.0  RECENT CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES


     1.  Users converting existing FORTRAN  applications  to
         FORTRAN  77 as well as those writing new FORTRAN 77
         programs  will  be  able  to  use   the   load-time
         typechecking    facility    in   LINK.    Use   the
         /DEBUG:ARUGMENTS switch when compiling your FORTRAN
         program   to   get   link-time   messages  flagging
         inconsistencies in the number and kind of arguments
         being  passed  to  a  subroutine  or  function.  In
         addition the /ERRORLEVEL or /LOGLEVEL LINK switches
         may be used to get more detailed information.

     2.  If compilation errors occur during  the  processing
         of  a  LOAD, DEBUG or EXECUTE command LINK will now
         issue  the  ?LNKSUP  Loading  Suppressed   message.
         FORTRAN  version  7  and  future languages will not
         necessarily  produce  .REL  files  if   compilation
         errors  occur.   For  languages  that  produce .REL
         files despite errors, run LINK explicitly  or  give
         the  LOAD,  DEBUG or EXECUTE command a second time.
         This will clear the  compilation  error  count  and
         LINK will load the files.

     3.  LINK now supports writable overlays.  See Chapter 5
         of  the  new LINK-10 manual for more information on
         this feature.  This chapter has been  expanded  and
         extensively  revised and it should prove helpful to
         users  writing  command  files  to  build  overlaid
         programs.

     4.  LINK   supports   the   following   new   switches:
         /SUPPRESS  (  for  "undefining"  a global symbol ),
         /LIMIT ( for limiting the  size  of  a  segment  or
         PSECT ) and /MAXNODE ( for increasing the number of
         overlay links that can be included in a single load
         ).   These  new  switches  are described in the new
                                                      Page 4


         LINK-10 manual.

     5.  The  /PLTTYP  switch  permits  a  user  to  specify
         whether  a  disk  file  should be plotter format or
         printer format.




5.0  RESTRICTIONS


     1.  It is possible to cause infinite looping or illegal
         memory  references  if  segments or PSECTs overlap.
         This   happens   because   reference   chains   for
         unresolved symbols may be corrupted by the overlap.
         Use the /LIMIT switch to set the  maximum  size  of
         segments  and  PSECTs  to  get memory maps, logs or
         other  diagnostic  information  if  you  find  that
         changing  a  program's  size  or position in memory
         causes LINK to loop when loading the program.

     2.  If a program is being structured  to  use  overlays
         and  there  is  a  very  large  number  of  symbols
         associated with a particular overlay link, LINK may
         issue  an  ?LNKMEF  memory expansion error if a map
         file is requested.  If this occurs use  the  switch
         /NOLOCAL on some or all modules being loaded to cut
         back the number of symbols.

     3.  Sites which customize LINK to  search  user-defined
         libraries  by default require a patch to the module
         LNKINI to avoid an "Unknown Language" error.   This
         patch will be included in a future AUTOPATCH tape.

     4.  Users who request a  runtime  log  file  for  their
         overlaid  FORTRAN  programs  require a patch to the
         overlay handler.  This patch will be included in  a
         future AUTOPATCH tape.

     5.  An illegal memory reference may occur when LINK  is
         writing  a  line printer format overlay plot.  This
         patch will be included in a future AUTOPATCH tape.




6.0  NOTES ON .REL BLOCK RESTRICTIONS FOR COMPILER WRITERS


     1.  There are inconsistencies in  the  usage  of  PSECT
         indices in old and new .REL blocks.
                                                      Page 5


     2.  LINK currently expects type 1120-1127 blocks to use
         routine  names that can be translated to SIXBIT and
         which are unique in the first six characters.  Also
         this  routine  name  must be a global symbol.  Type
         mismatch warnings also display only the  first  six
         SIXBIT  characters  of  the global symbol name.  No
         currently supported language is  affected  by  this
         deficiency.

     3.  The .TPLOD  bit  defined  for  the  type  1120-1127
         blocks   is   not  currently  used.   No  currently
         supported language is affected by this deficiency.

     4.  There are conflicts between the  documentation  and
         the implementation of type 1070 blocks:
          Fullword  addition  is  used  for  additive  symbol
          fixups.

          Right halfword addition is used for other  additive
          fixups.

          Fullword fixups are done when thirty-bit fixups are
          requested.

     No currently supported language is  affected  by  these
     errors.
