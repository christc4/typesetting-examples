Version:

1.0	Implemented a  new File  Transfer Spooler  for TOPS-20.   FTS-20
	utilizes a completely new, RMS-based DAP interface.  The  DECNET
	interface, known  as  BLISSNET-20, is  also  newly  implemented,
	although based on specifications of Paul Winalski.  The queueing
	system is new, and completely independant of GALAXY.  The  COMND
	interface is the Dawson COMAND package, with some modifications.
