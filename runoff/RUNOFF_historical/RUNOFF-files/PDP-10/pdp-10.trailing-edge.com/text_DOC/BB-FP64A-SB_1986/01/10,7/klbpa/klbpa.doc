1.0  SUMMARY

KLBPA is a program which controls the Background Performance  Analysis
statistics   gathering   by  a  7-series  TOPS-10  monitor  using  the
"performance meter" available on all KL-10 cpus.  As  such,  KLBPA  is
meaningful only on KL-10 based systems.

KLBPA has been tested on KL-10 processors under the  7.00  version  of
the monitor.

See the manual KLBPA.MAN for details on  how  to  use  KLBPA  and  the
manual  SYSDPY.MAN  for  an  explanation  of  the  currently available
statistics gathered.
