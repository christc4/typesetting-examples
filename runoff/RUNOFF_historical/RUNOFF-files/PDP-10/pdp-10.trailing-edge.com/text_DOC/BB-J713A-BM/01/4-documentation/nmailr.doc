NMAILR.DOC -- Changes from V101B(27) to V3(30)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

NMAILR is a systems program which allows users  to  send  messages  to
users  at  other sites on the ARPANET.  Messages sent by SNDMSG may be
stored in the sender's disk area and then sent  over  the  ARPANET  by
NMAILR.   If  the remote site is down NMAILR tries to send the message
again later.

NMAILR version 3(30) runs only on Release 3 of TOPS-20AN.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in NMAILR for Release 3.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None as of 1-January-78.



4.0  INSTALLATION AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run NMAILR

NMAILR consists of one file, NMAILR.EXE.

NMAILR creates the file <SYSTEM>MAILER.FLAGS to keep track of of users
that have mail to be sent over the ARPANET.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing NMAILR

Mount the  tape  labeled  QT010  on  MTA0:   and  type  the  following
commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 2

     NMAILR.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV
