SNDMSG.DOC -- Changes from V101B(54) to V3(55)
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

SNDMSG is a program which allows  users  to  send  messages  to  other
users,  both locally and at other sites on the ARPANET.  Messages sent
by SNDMSG are stored in the receiver's disk area so that they  may  be
referenced when convenient.

SNDMSG version 3(55) runs only on Release 3 of TOPS-20AN.

SNDMSG depends on the programs NMAILR to send mail over  the  ARPANET.
Also,  the  program  RDMAIL  is  used  by  message  recepients to read
messages.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in SNDMSG for Release 3.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

SNDMSG will only send mail to non-files only directories on  PS:.   If
you  want to send messages to other directories, you must send them to
the file <DIRECTORY-NAME>MAIL.TXT explicitly.



4.0  INSTALLATION AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run SNDMSG

SNDMSG consists of one file, SNDMSG.EXE.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing SNDMSG

Mount the  tape  labeled  QT010  on  MTA0:   and  type  the  following
commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 2
     RESTORE <*>SNDMSG.EXE (TO) SYS:*.*.-1
     REWIND

4.3  Files Needed to Build SNDMSG

     SNDMSG.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building SNDMSG

Mount the  tape  labeled  QT010  on  MTA0:   and  type  the  following
commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 3
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <SELF>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C

4.5  Special Considerations

must   be   running.   Ordinarily,  this  system  program  is  started
automatically by SYSJOB.

6.0  SUGGESTIONS
