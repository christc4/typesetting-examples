D2D (disk to disk) copies an entire  disk  pack  to  another
disk  pack.   Using  Super-USETI  and  Super-USETO  (SUSET.)
instead of LOOKUP and ENTER, as well as performing  its  own
file  space  allocation  and  Storage Allocation Table (SAT)
management, results in a fast copy.   At  the  Univesity  of
Texas at Austin, copies of RP06s using FUR which run 4 hours
are performed in 40 minutes with D2D.  Unlike  "image"  copy
programs  which  also  use  SUSET.  but simply copy block to
block and result in a  useless  BADBLK.SYS,  D2D  creates  a
refreshed pack with a valid BADBLK.SYS.
