                    OPERATING PROCEDURES


                          LOADING

Load LNKX11 with the command .LOAD LNKX11,LNKXEX
and then .SSAVE LNKX11 (code is two-segment).


                          RUNNING

Run LNKX11 by typing the monitor command .R LNKX11


                            NOTE

               This assumes that LNKX11 is
               resident in SYS:


LNKX11 will respond with:
        LINK Vxx (where xx is the LINK version number)
        #

                       COMMAND STRING

Type a command string in the following format:
#(load module),(load map),(symbol table) = (object modules)
(/ switches)
The default extensions for these are:

Load Module             LDA
Map Output              MAP
Object Module           OBJ
Symbol Table            STB


Commands can be read from a file, called the "indirect
command file." There is no default extension for this file.
An indirect file is specified by @.
Example:        @myfile.cmd
