There were a few modifications that we made to the XCOM from  DATALINE
Systems.  ULXCOM has those changes.

These   modifications   eliminate  the  sensitivity  to  the  case  of
identifiers, handle tabs in the source text a bit more elegantly,  and
print out the procedure names on the controlling TTY as they are being
compiled.

Suggested functionality: 1) Add CREFing. 2) Handle line numbers in the
source. (Modify HMON). 3) Generate KL extended instructions for string
operations.
