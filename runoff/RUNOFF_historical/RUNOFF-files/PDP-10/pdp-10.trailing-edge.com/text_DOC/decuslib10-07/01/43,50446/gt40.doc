                   GIDUS-DISLIB IMPLEMENTATION



     THIS  BACKUP  TAPE  CONTAINS  SIX  SAVE  SETS   WRITTEN   IN
INTERCHANGE MODE.  THESE SAVE SETS ARE:

       I) DOCUMENTATION

      II) SIXBIT LOADER

     III) EIGHT BIT LOADER

      IV) MACRO-11 FILES

       V) DISLIB ROUTINES

      VI) ALL FILES



     AT ACADIA THE GT40 IS CONNECTED TO THE DECSYSTEM-10 ALONG  A
STANDARD TELETYPE INTERFACE AS LINE NUMBER 1 (THIS IS A 2400 BAUD
LINE).  IF THE GT40 IS NOT CONNECTED ON LINE  NUMBER  1  AT  YOUR
INSTALLATION  IT  WILL  BE NECESSARY TO MODIFY THE ROUTINE IO.MAC
AND THEN FUDGE IT IN TO  THE  APPROPRIATE  DISLIB  LIBRARY.   THE
MODIFICATION  NEEDED  IS  VERY SIMPLE AND CAN BE FOUND BY READING
IO.MAC.  THE FILE "DISLIB.REL" IS THE  DISLIB  LIBRARY  FOR  JOBS
USING   THE  F40  COMPILER  (AS  WE  DO  AT  ACADIA).   THE  FILE
"DISF10.REL" IS DISLIB COMPILED WITH THE FORTRAN-10 COMPILER.

     THE  BINARY  PROGRAMS  FOR  THE   GT40   ("SCROLL.BIN"   AND
"GIDUS.BIN") WERE ASSEMBLED FROM THE CORRESPONDING P11 FILES WITH
THE MACDLX CROSS ASSEMBLER.  THE TWO LOADER PROGRAMS  EXPECT  THE
OBJECT PROGRAMS TO BE IN THE FORMAT OUTPUT BY MACDLX (I.E.  PAPER
TAPE FORMAT).  FURTHERMORE THE FILE "SYSMAC.SML" IS NECESSARY FOR
ASSEMBLY SO THE ASSEMBLER "PALX11" WILL NOT DO.

     ACADIA SUPPLIES NO MAINTENANCE FOR THE GIDUS-DISLIB  PACKAGE
BUT  I WOULD BE WILLING TO ATTEMPT BUG FIXES BY MAIL.  HOWEVER, I
WILL BE LEAVING ACADIA ON AUGUST 31, 1977.  THE SYSTEM  HAS  BEEN
RUNNING  FOR  OVER A YEAR AT ACADIA AND SEEMS QUITE STABLE.  BEST
OF LUCK WITH YOUR INSTALLATION AND I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED  WITH
THE PERFORMANCE OF GIDUS-DISLIB.
