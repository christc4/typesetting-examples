                  ANSI format tape writer
               User's guide and documentation




     TAPE11 is a TOPS-20 only utility  to  write  tapes  for
transportation to non-TOPS20 machines.  ANSI standard labels
are used to identify the files written to the tape.   TAPE11
has   the   capability  to  write  either  ASCII  or  EBCDIC
characters to the tape.  It has limited support for  writing
8-bit  binary  images as well.  TAPE11 has full defaults for
most parameters when writing tapes.  Defaults not  built  in
on program startup are physical block length, logical record
length, volume ID and tape drive specification.


Command Action


ASCII

          ASCII is the default character set to write  tapes
     with.   Since the KL10 is using only 7 bits of data per
     byte, no parity bit is  set  when  the  characters  are
     converted   to  8  bits.   The  character  set  in  use
     determines how labels are written.  ASCII writes  ASCII
     labels, EBCDIC writes EBCDIC labels.  The character set
     may not be changed after volume labels are written.


BLOCKSIZE

          BLOCKSIZE sets the number of  bytes  per  physical
     record  when  writing  data  to  the tape.  The command
     accepts a decimal number in the range of 80  to  32768.
     The  default is 512.  This command must be given before
     any  files  may  be  written  to  tape.   Setting   the
     BLOCKSIZE   to   a   value  smaller  than  the  current
     RECORDSIZE produces a warning message, and  resets  the
     RECORDSIZE to be equal to the BLOCKSIZE.


DENSITY

          DENSITY sets the bits per inch (BPI) to  use  when
     writing tapes.  Allowed values are 200, 556, 800, 1600,
     6250 and DEFAULT.  Setting an illegal value  (say  6250
     BPI  on  a  TU45) will produce errors only when data is
     written to the tape.  DEFAULT defaults to the last  SET
     TAPE DENSITY given to the EXEC.

EBCDIC

          EBCDIC sets the character set used in writing  the
     tape  to  IBM EBCDIC.  All labels and data written will
     be translated from ASCII into EBCDIC.   Once  data  has
     been  written  to  tape,  the  character set may not be
     changed.  See the ASCII command.


EOT

          EOT is a tape positioning command.  It  moves  the
     tape  to after the last file (to the double tape mark).
     If the EOT command is used,  the  VOLUME  command  must
     have  been  given or the file labels will be incorrect.
     (The file set ID will  show  "Anylbl").   This  command
     will  produce an error if data has already been written
     to tape.


EXIT

          EXIT ends the execution of TAPE11.   The  tape  is
     unaffected.  CONTINUE will restart TAPE11.


FILE

          FILE specifies a file to write to the  tape.   The
     specification  allows  wildcards  in  every field.  The
     format of the command is FILE Str:<Dev>File.Ext.Gen the
     default  is *.*.* Files that cannot be accessed are not
     processed.  Data errors in the source file are  treated
     like  an  EOF.   The FILE command may be given multiple
     times in one running of TAPE11.


FORMAT

          FORMAT selects the data format to write  the  tape
     with.   Options  are  BINARY, DEFAULT, FIXED, IMAGE and
     VARIABLE.  BINARY format is the same as  IMAGE,  except
     that 8 bit bytes are read from disk.  Data is read from
     disk in RECORDSIZE chunks and written directly to  tape
     in    BLOCKSIZE   physical   length   records   without
     conversion.  If RECORDSIZE does  not  equal  BLOCKSIZE,
     then  the  records  written on tape are padded with the
     pad character.  The default  format  is  IMAGE.   FIXED
     format  is  N  records per block, each record taking up
     exactly  RECORDSIZE  bytes,  packed  into  a  BLOCKSIZE
     buffer.  Card image records are written in this format.
     (80/800 normally).  VARIABLE  format  is  the  FILES11A
     format for compatability with RSX/RSTS/VMS systems.  In
     VARIABLE format, records of up to RECORDSIZE  are  read

     and  inserted  into  the BLOCKSIZE record with a 4 byte
     header.  No CR or LF  is  inserted  after  the  record.
     NULLS are not written.  If a record is to big to fit in
     the space remaining, it is placed at the start  of  the
     next  block,  and  the partial block is filled with pad
     characters.


HEADERS

          The HEADERS command  changes  the  number  of  HDR
     records  written  in the tape label field.  The minumum
     count is 2, the  maximum  is  9.   The  format  of  the
     command  is  HEADERS  n Where "n" is a positive decimal
     number.  The records (HDR3 to HDR9) are all blanks past
     byte position 4.


HELP

          HELP lists a short description of all commands.


INFORMATION

          INFORMATION lists all current  settings  and  tape
     status.   If  a  parameter  has  not been set, it is so
     noted.


LABELS

          LABELS sets a flag to inhibit the  actual  writing
     of  labels on the tape.  If no labels are selected, the
     80.  character labels are  not  applied  to  the  tape.
     Arguments are YES to write the labels (default), and NO
     to inhibit the writing.  You must still supply  a  tape
     volume ID.  This feature is useful for writing straight
     card image tapes.


PADDING

          PADDING  specifys  the  character  used   to   pad
     incomplete  records.   When  BLOCKSIZE  is not an exact
     multiple of RECORDSIZE, or a record is read  that  does
     not  fill  RECORDSIZE  in  FIXED mode, there are unused
     bytes at the end of the  record  or  buffer.   The  pad
     character is inserted to fill the gap.  The default (at
     startup) is "^"  (octal  136).   PADDING  requires  one
     octal argument.


PARITY
TAPE11 ANSI format tape writer                        Page 4
EFBS at EE for ASW


          PARITY specifies the parity to  use  when  writing
     the  tape.  Options are EVEN or ODD.  ODD parity is the
     standard, and is the default.


PUSH

          PUSH duplicates the action  of  the  EXEC  command
     PUSH.   It  starts  up another EXEC and waits for it to
     finish.  Type POP to return to TAPE11.


RECORDSIZE

          RECORDSIZE specifies the logical record length for
     reading  records from disk, and the size of the logical
     record when blocking records together in FIXED  format.
     RECORDSIZE  must  not exceed BLOCKSIZE.  The default is
     512.  byte  records.   The  range  is  80.   to  32768.
     RECORDSIZE  requires  a  decimal  number of bytes as an
     argument.


TAPE

          TAPE specifies the tape drive to use  for  writing
     files.   The  tape  must be mounted without the labeled
     tape facility in action.   This  means  that  the  tape
     should  be  mounted  as  UNLABLED,  or  be  put  on  an
     unrestricted drive.  Using a labeled tape  with  TAPE11
     will  produce  an  unreadable result.  The TAPE command
     requires a valid tape  specification  as  an  argument.
     I.E.  MTA0:, not MT0:!!


VOLUME

          VOLUME specifies the 6 character volume identifier
     that is written as the first record on the tape.  It is
     also written as part of  every  HDR1  and  EOF1  record
     label.   The default is "TAPE11", or if the EOT command
     was given, "ANYLBL".

     Tape errors  are  retried  once  (monitor  retries  are
used).   If  the record fails to write, a large inter-record
gap (3 inches) is written, and the operation is retried.  If
it still fails, the program gives up and goes on to the next
record.  Errors are identified by block and record number.

     After every file is written, a record and  block  total
is   printed.   After  all  files  in  a  specification  are
processed, a message is printed.  Nulls are not  written  in
VARIABLE  format.  After the last file on tape is written, a
double tape mark is made.
