           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary to set up your
     DECSYSTEM-20 for patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter 2 of the Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference Manual.  This initialization operation is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be able
     to apply the patches distributed periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.  In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must
     create a disk directory referred to as the autopatching directory.
     This directory is used to patch and rebuild the software.  In the
     autopatching directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.  In
     addition, you must also prepare a distribution directory for each
     product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described for
     each of the autopatchable products in section 3 of this document.
     For the DECSYSTEM-20 the following products are currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 1.2 of ALGOL-20

            Version 2 of APLSF-20

            Version 2.1 of BASIC-PLUS-2

     Autopatch V1.2 is supported for applying only those patches
     provided by Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those patches are supported for distributed
     (field-image) software or distributed software that has been
     modified only by autopatching.
                                                                  Page 3


     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an autopatching structure named AP20:, we
     recommend that you make an entry in the LOGIN.CMD file and the
     BATCH.CMD file that DEFINEs AP20:  to be the structure you will be
     using.  If you do this, you will not need to edit the Dumper
     Control Files used to set up the product distribution directories
     or to retrieve patches.  The LOGIN.CMD and BATCH.CMD files must be
     on the PS:  structure for the account you will be logging into to
     SUBMIT these batch control files.  We recommend that you use
     <AUTOPATCH> as this directory name.  The second save-set of the
     patch tape contains tools and control files that are used in the
     autopatching operation.  A list of all the files in this save-set
     is given in section 4 of this document.  Use the DUMPER program to
     restore from this save set to the appropriate disk directories
     those files you need.  The following files should be installed in
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE
     The following file should be installed in PS:<HELP> or one of the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP
     The following file should be installed in the disk directory you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP201.PDF
     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and a
     product description file must be installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to autopatch.  These files
     are in the installation save-set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.  The installation save-set also
     contains batch control files to assist you in setting up the
     product distribution directories.  These "Distribution DUMPER
     Control" files are intended to run under batch.  They issue a MOUNT
     request for the product distribution tape and then run DUMPER to
     restore the required files.  See the last section for a list of
     these files.  For each product you intend to autopatch, you should
     install the associated control files in the autopatching directory.
     For example, if you intend to autopatch the APLSF-20-V2 product you
     would install

                APL2S2.CTL      for APLSF-20 rebuild
                APL2S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL2S2.DDC      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.
                                                                  Page 4


     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for ALGOL-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP
     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE file but
     does have a ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in the ALGOL Autopatch Installation directory
     (INS:).  Unless you COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT process for ALGOL-20-V1-2 will fail.  An edit
     supplied for the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.  The following file is required
     to build the ALGOL product.  It must be available either in the
     patching area (PAT:), the distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the ALGOL-20 distribution
     tape BB-5471C-BM into the disk directory you have set up as the
     ALGOL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save-set "SOURCE files for ALGOL"
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the ALGOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
                                                                  Page 5


     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>ALGV12.DDC
        
     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch build process for ALGOL redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that a structure be specified when providing the directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.
                                                                  Page 6


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Before preparing the APL product for autopatching, it should be
     installed on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.  To make the
     product autopatchable, some of the files from the product
     distribution tape will have to be installed in the disk directory
     that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.  The disk
     directory in which you have installed the executable files for
     APLSF-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.  In
     most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                APLSF.EXE
                GENSF.EXE
                APLTAP.EXE
     You will need to copy the following files from the APLSF-20
     distribution tape BB-5137E-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the APLSF-20 distribution directory.
        
           From save-set "REL LIBRARY FOR TOPS-20 APLSF VERSION 2"
        
                APLS22.REL
                APLG22.REL
                APLW22.REL
                APLS22.LNK
                APLG22.LNK
                APLW22.LNK
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the APLSF-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APL>.  If you wish to
     use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD
     file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.APL> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>APL2S2.DDC

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING BASIC-PLUS-2

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for BASIC-PLUS-2 is referred to as
     the product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                BASIC.EXE
                BASOTS.EXE
     You will need to copy the following files from the BASIC-PLUS-2
     distribution tape BB-5543F-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the BASIC-PLUS-2 distribution directory.
        
        From save-set "Autopatch files for BASIC PLUS 2 version 2.1(320)"
        
                B20CMA.LNK
                B20CMA.REL
                B20OTA.LNK
                B20OTA.REL
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the BASIC-PLUS-2 distribution tape and then
     restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.BASIC>.  If you
     wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.BASIC>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>B20V2A.DDC
        
     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 8


     3.4  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING COBOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for COBOL-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                COBDDT.REL
                COBLIB.REL
                COBOL.EXE

                CPYLIB.EXE
                ISAM.EXE
                RERUN.EXE
     The COBOL V13 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build and/or via encrypted EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files
     from the COBOL-20 V13 distribution tape BB-Z795A-SM into the disk
     directory you have set up as the COBOL-20 distribution directory.

        From save-set "SOURCE files for COBOL V13"

                COBOTS-V13.KEY
                CPYLIB.KEY
                ISAM.KEY
                RERUN.KEY

        If using COBOL-20 V13 with DBMS V6 or V6.1:

        From save-set "BUILDING files for COBOL V13"

                C8XSHR.REL
     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the following
     files are required to build the COBOL product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

                                                                  Page 9


        UNVDEL.CMD

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the COBOL-20 distribution
     tape into the disk directory you have set up as the COBOL-20
     distribution directory.

          Autopatch renames COPYRT.MAC to be COPYRT.CBL
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the COBOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.CBL13>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13.DDC
                for source file updating

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13R.DDC
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for the
     re-build of this product as well as the Autopatch product
     description file are supplied in the Installation save-set on the
     Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in the
     first save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for more information.  The Autopatch build process for COBOL
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.  If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will need
     to copy the following files from the DBMS-20 distribution tape into
     the disk directory you have set up as the COBOL-20 distribution
     directory.

     to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.  If you wish to use this control
     file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will want to
     include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file on the

     If you are NOT autopatching the DBMS-20 product the selection
     process for COBOL V13 will report checksum mismatches for the DBMS
     components of the COBOL compiler.  These messages can be ignored.
     Unlike the V6 product, the V6.1 Autopatch procedure requires that
     COBOL and/or FORTRAN be built BEFORE the DBMS V6.1 Autopatch build
     is submitted.  The DBMS V6.1 Autopatch procedure will implement
     DBMS within COBOL and FORTRAN.
                                                                 Page 12


     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-20 V6.1

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for DBMS-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DBMS.REL
                FORDML.EXE
                XDML.EXE

     The following files are required to build the DBMS product.  They
     must be available either in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL        WILD.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the DBMS-20 V6.1 distribution
     tape BB-4148F-BM into the disk directory you have set up as the
     DBMS-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save-set "DBMS SOURCE FILES"

                DBINFO.CMD

                XDBIND.FIX
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DBMS-20 V6.1 distribution tape and then
                                                                 Page 13


     restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.  If you
     wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> as
     the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB2V61.DDC
        
     Revised copies of DBCS24.CMD, DBCS28.CMD and DBCS2F.CMD for the
     DBMS-V6 product have been delivered on Autopatch tapes.  Be sure
     that these files are NOT in the common patching directory (PAT:).
     If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will need to copy
     the following files from the DBMS-20 distribution tape into the
     disk directory you have set up as the COBOL-20 distribution
     directory.
        
        From save-set "DBMS SOURCE FILES"

                STRDCL.MAC
                STRUNV.MAC
                COPYRT.MAC
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the last save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue a mount
     request for the DBMS-20 distribution tape and then restore the
     appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.  In the DDC file
     which also prepares the COBOL-20 directory CDIS:  is defined to be
     AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.  If you wish to use this control file, but
     are not using an AP20:  structure, you will want to include a 'DEF
     AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure
     for the LOGIN account from which you will SUBMIT this control file.
     However, you will have to edit this control file if you choose not
     to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> or <AUTOPATCH.CBL13> as the distribution
     directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB2V61-CBL.DDC
        
     If you are NOT autopatching the DBMS-20 product the selection

     process for COBOL V13 will report checksum mismatches for the DBMS
     components of the COBOL compiler.  These messages can be ignored.
     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch build process for DBMS redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that a structure be specified when providing the directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.  Unlike the V6
     product, the V6.1 Autopatch procedure requires that COBOL and/or
     FORTRAN be built BEFORE the DBMS V6.1 Autopatch build is submitted.
     The DBMS V6.1 Autopatch procedure will implement DBMS within COBOL
     and FORTRAN.  The DBMS control file will re-build the COBOL OTS in
     PAT:.  You should not INSTALL COBOL until after the DBMS build has
     finished.  Otherwise, you will have to manually copy the COBOL
     files built by DBMS to INS:.  A similar circumstance exists with
     FORTRAN.  If you will be Autopatching DBMS for use with FORTRAN you
     may want to remove the leading semi-colons associated with DBMSF
     from the FTN211.PDF and/or FTN2X1.PDF file before SELECTing FORTRAN
     for Autopatching.  Then you should not INSTALL FORTRAN until after
     the DBMS build has finished.  Otherwise, you will have to manually
     copy the DBMSF.EXE file built by DBMS to INS:.

     The DBMS control file will create the following language support
     files:

     For COBOL-74 V12C support (KS only)
        C74O12.EXE
        C74LIB.REL see notes 1 and 2

     For COBOL V13 support (KL only)
        COBOTS-V13.EXE
        COBLIB.REL see note 2

     For FORTRAN V11 support
        DBMSF.EXE
        FORLIB.REL see note 3

        Note 1: created when the DBMS-20 V6.1 stub is not detected
                     in the existing link-time library.
        Note 2: created when DBMS-20 V6 support had previously been
                     added into the link-time library.
        Note 3: created when the supplied FORLIB.REL does not contain
                     FORTRAN edit 3354.

     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET-20


     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you MUST install
     the product on your system as described in the DECNET-20
     Installation Guide in Notebook 7 of the TOPS-20 Notebook set.
     Unless the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to
     SELECT it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for DECNET-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:

        CTERM-SERVER.EXE        NETGEN.EXE
        DNMAC.EXE               NFT.EXE
        DTEDMP.SYS              NIPGEN.EXE
        DTEMPS.SYS              NMLT20.EXE
        DTEMPT.SYS              SETHOST.EXE
        FAL.EXE                 TKB36.EXE
        NCPTAB.REL              VNP36.EXE
                                *.SYS

     *.SYS is the front end system file with your node name
     You will need to copy all of the files in the PS:<DN20> directory
     from the DECNET-20 distribution tape BB-H240E-BM into the disk
     directory you have set up as the DECNET-20 distribution directory.
     These files should already exist in the PS:<DN20> directory as part
     of the original DECNET-20 installation.

        DAPLIB.MAC      DNCONN.MAC      NFT.MAC         SETHOS.MAC
     A batch control file to retrieve these files has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DECNET-20 distribution tape and then
     restore the third save-set to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DECNET>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DECNET>
     as the distribution directory.


        To execute this control file, issue the following command:

        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DEC2V4.DDC

     The DECNET-20 front end build also requires the following files
     from the original installation:

        CETAB.MAC
        NETPAR.MAC
        NMLACC.MAC

     The above files are NOT on the release tape.  They are created
     during the required installation process.  NMLACC.MAC is deleted
     after a successful front end build to protect the Network
     Management Access Control information it contains.  Connect to the
     directory in which your front end was built and do the following:

        @NETGEN
        NETGEN>RESTORE xxxxxx.CNF

        ;where xxxxxx is your front end node
        ;name.  The configuration file (.CNF)
        ;was automatically saved when you did
        ;the original installation.

        ;If your site doesn't use Network Management Access Control
        ;skip the following 3 DEFINE commands

        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT USER foo1
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT PASSWORD foo2
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT foo2

        NETGEN>FINISH

     Copy CETAB.MAC and NETPAR.MAC into the DECNET-20 Autopatch
     distribution directory.  If you wish the protection of having the
                                                                 Page 17


     NMLACC.MAC file deleted after a successful build, rename it into
     the directory you have set up as the DECNET-20 patching directory,
     and the above procedure will be required before each Autopatch
     update of DECNET-20.  Otherwise, copy NMLACC.MAC into the DECNET-20
     Autopatch distribution directory.

     When SELECTing this product for Autopatching the PEP program will
     ask for the nodename.  Use the same name as was used during the
     initial installation.  If your product installation directory
     (INS:) does not include the front end system image, usually
     "nodename".SYS, then copy it into that directory.

     Connect back to your original directory.

     It is possible to use DECNET without the MCB front-end code.  At
     this time, the Autopatch process for DECNET requires you to build
     the MCB.  If you do not intend to use the MCB then you may SELECT
     DECNET for Autopatching after 1) creating a null FOO.SYS file in
     the directory you intend to use as INS:  and 2) copying the
     CETAB.MAC, NETPAR.MAC and NMLACC.MAC files from the second save-set
     of the Autopatch tape into the area you intend to use as DIS:.

     When SELECTing DECNET answer the node name with FOO.SYS.  The Patch
     and Build control file for the re-build of this product as well as
     the Autopatch product description file are supplied in the
     Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last section
     of this document for a list of these files.  There is a DUMPER
     control file provided in the first save-set which will restore
     these files to the proper directory.  See the README documentation
     in the first save-set for more information.

     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for FORTRAN-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                FORTRA.EXE
                FORO11.EXE
                FORLIB.REL
                FORDDT.REL

     The FORTRAN V11 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build and/or via encrypted EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption the KEY files must be retrieved from the
     FORTRAN distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-20 V11 distribution tape BB-4157I-SM into
     the disk directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-20 distribution
     directory.

        From the seventh save set

                FORTRA.KEY
                FORLIB.KEY
                FORO11.KEY
                FORDDT.KEY
     If you are also using DBMS with FORTRAN you will need the
     FORDBM.REL file from the first save set of the Autopatch tape.  If
     you desire to Autopatch FORTRAN via updated sources the following
     files are required.  They must be available either in the patching
     area (PAT:), the distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV
        MONSYM.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the FORTRAN-20 distribution
     tape BB-4157I-SM into the disk directory you have set up as the
     FORTRAN-20 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the FORTRAN-20 distribution tape and then
     restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>.  If
                                                                 Page 20


     you wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>FTN211.DDC
                        for source file updating

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>FTN2X1.DDC
                        for EXE/REL replacement updating
        
     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for the
     re-build of this product as well as the Autopatch product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set on the
     Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in the
     first Save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for more information.  The Autopatch build process for FORTRAN
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.
                                                                 Page 21


     3.8  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FTS-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for FTS-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                FTS.EXE
                FTSLIB.REL
     You will need to copy the following files from the FTS distribution
     tape BB-M251A-BM into the disk directory you have set up as the
     FTS-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the second save-set
        
                FTSLIB.REL

        From the third save-set

                FTS20.REL
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the FTS-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTS>.  If you wish to
     use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD
     file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.FTS> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>FTS201.DDC
        
     Since there is some file/module set-up processing and some of the
     files must be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file
     to set up the directory.  The FTS product build also requires some
     files from the Autopatch tape.  The following files are put into
     the FTS patching directory by the DUMPER Control Files which
     process the Autopatch Tape.
                DAP2V1.REL
                XPN2V1.REL
     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
                                                                 Page 22

     3.9  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING GALAXY-20

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for GALAXY-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                BATCON.EXE      NEBULA.EXE
                CDRIVE.EXE      OPR.EXE
                GLXLIB.EXE      ORION.EXE
                GLXLIB.REL      PLEASE.EXE
                LISSPL.EXE      QUASAR.EXE
                LPTSPL.EXE      SPRINT.EXE
                MOUNTR.EXE      SPROUT.EXE
     The following files are required to build the GALAXY product.  They
     must be available either in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        ACTSYM.UNV      ARMAIL.REL      LCPORN.REL      LCPTAB.REL
        MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV      NCPTAB.REL
        NEBMAC.UNV      SERCOD.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from a TOPS-20 distribution set
     into the disk directory you have set up as the GALAXY-20
     distribution directory.
        
     TOPS-20 V7.0 Distribution tape BB-LW55A-BM

        SPRINT.MAC      SPROUT.MAC
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     mount requests for the TOPS-20 distribution tapes and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>.  If you wish
                                                                 Page 24


     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>GALV60.DDC
        
     If you use any of the TOPS-20 Monitor/EXEC DDC files, the required
     files for this product will be loaded into a common distribution
     directory which must be specified when selecting this product for
     autopatching.  The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of
     this product as well as the Autopatch product description file are
     supplied in the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See
     the last section of this document for a list of these files.  There
     is a DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 25


     3.10  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING IBMCOM-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for IBMCOM-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
                                        HASP only

     An indirect command file to perform this operation has been
     included in the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This
     file will issue mount requests for the IBMCOM-20 distribution tapes
     and then restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.
     In this batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.IBMET>
     or AP20:<AUTOPATCH.IBMHSP>.  If you wish to use this control file,
     but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will want to include a
     'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:
     structure for the LOGIN account from which you will SUBMIT this
     control file.  However, you will have to edit this control file if
     you choose not to use the supplied defaults as the distribution
     directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>IETV21.DDC      for IBMCOM-20-ET-V2-1
                or
        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>IHSV11.DDC      for IBMCOM-20-HASP-V1-1
        
     The PROD.P11 file is included on the Autopatch tape.  The IETV21
     and IHSV11 DUMPER command files to process the Autopatch tape will
     copy the PROD.P11 file to the default distribution directory.  This
     must be done before the IBMCOM products will be able to be
     SELECTed.  The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of
     this product as well as the Autopatch product description file are
     supplied in the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See
     the last section of this document for a list of these files.  There
     is a DUMPER command file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.

        MSTXT.MAC       MSUNV.MAC       MSUTL.MAC       MSUUO.MAC
        MSVER.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the TOPS-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.MS>.  If you wish to
     use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD
     file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.MS> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>MS211S.DDC
        
     The ARMAIL.MAC file is restored but is Autopatched by the UTILITIES
     product.  Be sure to use the ARMAIL.MAC file from the UTILITIES
     distribution area if you are Autopatching UTILITIES.  The Patch
     control file for this product as well as the Autopatch product
     description file are supplied in the Installation save-set on the
     Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in the
     first save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for more information.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the distribution tape and then restore the
     appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.MS>.  If you wish to use
     this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will
     want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file

     3.13  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING PASCAL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for PASCAL-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                PASCAL.EXE
                PASDDT.REL
                PASLIB.REL
                PASOTS.EXE
     The following files are required to build the PASCAL product.  They
     must be available either in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        CMD.REL         MACREL.REL
     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the PASCAL distribution tape
     BB-P557A-BM into the disk directory you have set up as the
     PASCAL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the fourth save-set
        
                PAS2D1.REL
                PAS2L1.REL
                PAS2O1.REL

        From the fifth save-set

                HSPACE.REL
                PAS2C1.REL
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the PASCAL-20 distribution tape and then
     restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.PASCAL>.  If you
     wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.PASCAL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>PAS2V1.DDC
        
                                                                 Page 30


     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of this product
     as well as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided in the first save-set which will
     restore these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 31


     3.14  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING PSI-20 V1.1

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  This product is very closely related to the
     DECNET-20-V4 product.  In fact, there are many common modules.  We
     have designed the Autopatch process for PSI to use part of the
     Autopatch process for DECNET.  You should read and follow the
     instructions for 'PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET-20 V4'.  DO
     NOT, however, SELECT DECNET-20 for Autopatching.  The PSI products
     include the DECNET products and you will be Autopatching the
     complete product set when you Autopatch PSI.  The disk directory in
     which you have installed the executable files for PSI-20 is
     referred to as the product installation directory.  In most cases
     this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to
     SYS:.  In addition to the files listed in the DECNET section of
     this document, this directory must contain the files:
        
        PSITST.EXE      X25GAF.REL      X25GAM.REL      X25GEN.EXE
        X29SRV.EXE
        *.SYS

     where * is the desired node name for your system and must match
     your response to the node name question which is asked when
     SELECTing PSI for Autopatching.  In addition to the files listed in
     the DECNET section of this document, you will need to copy the
     following files from the PSI-20 V1.1 distribution tape BB-W661B-BM
     into the disk directory you have set up as the DECNET-20
     distribution directory.
        
        From the third save-set
        
        FLN.STB         FLN.TSK         FLP.STB         FLP.TSK
        GAN.STB         GAN.TSK         GAT.STB         GAT.TSK
        NML.STB         NML.TSK         PLE.STB         PLE.TSK
        PLN.STB         PLN.TSK         PLP.STB         PLP.TSK
        FLPDLC.M11      GATLLC.M11      PLPLLC.M11

     Note that the NML.STB and NML.TSK files on the PSI distribution are
     different from the ones on the DECNET-20 distribution.  A batch
     control file to perform this operation has been included in the
     installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue a
     mount request for the PSI-20 distribution tape and then restore the
     appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DECNET>.  If you wish to use
     this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will
     want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file
     on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you will
     SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DECNET> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
                                                                 Page 32


        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>PSIV11.DDC
        
     Remember to FIRST use the DEC2V4.DDC file as described in the
     DECNET-20 section of this document.  The Patch and Build control
     file for the re-build of this product as well as the Autopatch
     product description file are supplied in the Installation save-set
     on the Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a
     list of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in
     the first save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for more information.
                                                                 Page 33


     3.15  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for SORT-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                SORT.EXE
     The SORT V5 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build and/or via encrypted EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from the
     SORT or COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the
     following files from the SORT-20 V5 distribution tape BB-Z761A-SM
     or the COBOL-20 V13 distribution tape BB-Z795A-SM into the disk
     directory you have set up as the SORT-20 distribution directory.

        From save-set "SOURCE files for SORT V5"

                SORT.KEY
     If you desire to Autopatch SORT via updated sources the following
     files are required to build the SORT product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        MACTEN.UNV      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the SORT-20 distribution tape
     or from the COBOL-20 distribution tape into the disk directory you
     have set up as the SORT-20 distribution directory.
        
           From save-set "SOURCE files for SORT V5"
        
                COPYRT.MAC
                COPYRT.TXT

                FTDEFS.UNV
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the SORT-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.SRTV5>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.SRTV5>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>SRTV5.DDC
                for source file patching from the SORT tape

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>SRTV5R.DDC
                for replacement patching from the SORT tape

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13.DDC
                for source file patching from the COBOL tape

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13R.DDC
                for replacement patching from the COBOL tape
     The use of one of the first two DDC files is only required if you
     do not have the COBOL distribution tape.  Use of either of the last
     two DDC files will load files into both the SORT and COBOL
     distribution areas.  The Patch and Build control file for the
     re-build of this product as well as the Autopatch product
     description file are supplied in the Installation save-set on the
     Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in the
     first save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for more information.  The Autopatch build process for SORT
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.

     3.16  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TOPS-20-2060

     The monitor and EXEC for all supported hardware configurations are
     autopatchable with Autopatch-10/20.  Before preparing TOPS-20 for
     autopatching, the monitor and EXEC should be installed on your
     system as described in the installation documentation for TOPS-20.
     The directory PS:<SYSTEM> in which you have installed the
     executable files for the monitor and EXEC is referred to as the
     installation directory.  This directory must contain the files:

     appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this control file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish to
     use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD
     file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20> as the
     distribution directory.  After creating the product distribution
     directory, submit the required control file as a batch job.

     3.17  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TOPS-20-TCPIP

     The monitor and EXEC for all supported hardware configurations are
     autopatchable with Autopatch-10/20.  Before preparing TOPS-20 for
     autopatching, the monitor and EXEC should be installed on your
     system as described in the installation documentation for TOPS-20.
     The directory PS:<SYSTEM> in which you have installed the
     executable files for the monitor and EXEC should be included as the
     last part of your definition for INS:.  This directory must contain
     the files:
        
                MONITR.EXE
                EXEC.EXE
                BUGSTRINGS.TXT

     Autopatch will install the updates to these files in the first area
     in the INS:  definition.  They must then be copied to <SYSTEM>.
     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for TOPS-20-TCPIP utilities is referred to as the product
     installation directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or
     one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This directory must
     contain the files:

                FTP.EXE
                FTPSRT.EXE
                FTSCTT.EXE
                IPHOST.EXE
                MAISER.EXE
                MMAILBOX.EXE
                MMAILR.EXE
                SMTJFN.EXE
                TELNET.EXE

     The following files are required to build the TOPS-20 product.
     They must be available either in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        D36PAR.UNV      GLOBS.UNV       LDINIT.REL      MACREL.REL

        PROLOG.UNV      SCAPAR.UNV      SERCOD.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the TOPS-20 2060 distribution
     tape BB-H138F-BM/BB-LW55A-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the TOPS-20-2060 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     mount requests for the TOPS-20 and TCP/IP tapes and then restore
     the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this control
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>
     as the distribution directory.  After creating the product
     distribution directory, submit the required control file as a batch
     job.
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>T26A70-BIG.DDC for BIG monitor

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>T26A70-MAX.DDC for MAX monitor
     Since there are a number of files involved and some of the files
     must be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file to set
     up the directory.  The Patch and Build control file for the
     re-build of this product as well as the Autopatch product
     description file are supplied in the Installation save-set on the
     Autopatch tape.  See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control file provided in the
     first save-set which will restore these files to the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for more information.

     3.18  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TRAFFIC-20-V4

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should install
     the product on your system as described in the installation
     documentation supplied on the product distribution tape.  Unless
     the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.  The disk directory in which you have
     installed the executable files for TRAFFIC-20 is referred to as the
     product installation directory.  In most cases this will be
     PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the directories belonging to SYS:.  This
     directory must contain the files:
        
                TFR.EXE         TFRCAL.UNV
                TFRCOB.REL      TFRUNV.UNV

     The following files are required to build the TRAFFIC product.
     They must be available either in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the current save-set of the Autopatch tape

        MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files from the TRAFFIC-20 V4
     distribution tape BB-5372E-SM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the TRAFFIC-20 distribution directory.

        TFR.MAC
     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the TRAFFIC-20 distribution tape and then
     restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TRAFFIC>.  If
     you wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TRAFFIC>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TFRPAT>TFR2V4.DDC

     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish
     to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
     BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from

     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>UTLV70.DDC
