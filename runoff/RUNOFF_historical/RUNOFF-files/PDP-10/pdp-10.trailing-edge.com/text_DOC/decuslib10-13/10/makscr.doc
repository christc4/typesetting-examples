Invoking Fpaint -

	To start Fpaint simply type the following --

	Fpaint Filename [/nosource] <cr>

		Filename - a FIVE character filename of all the Fpaint files:
			 Filename.SCR - the screen definition file.
			 Filename.AUX - the Fpaint auxillary file.
			 FIlename.FOR - the ForTran subroutine package
				         genarated by Fpaint.

		/nosource - if this switch is included no .AUX or .FOR
			  files are generated.





Editing an Fpaint screen -



-Moving around the screen

	Cursor Keys - The keyboard cursor keys allow you to move the cursor
		    around the screen, moving the cursor past the edge of the
		    screen in any direction will cause the cursor to wrap
		    around to the opposite edge of the screen.

	Tab/RevTab  - The keyboard tab key allows you to move horizontally
		    to the right on the screen eight columns at a time.  The
		    reverse tab ( Ctrl-X ) on the keyboard moves the cursor
		    to the left eight columns at a time.  The same rule for
		    screen wap applies to the tab keys as it did for the
		    cursor keys.


-Inserting and Deleting text

	Ctrl-W      - The mode of text insertion, insert or overwrite, is
      		    controlled with Ctrl-W.  The current insert mode is
		    displayed at the lower right of the screen.  Insert mode
		    will cause any character typed on the keyboard to be
		    inserted at the cursor position, the rest of the text
		    field will move to the right one position.  If the
		    character is not printable ( control characters, etc. ) or
		    there is no room for the character on the current line the
		    bell will ring and no action will be taken.

	Ctrl-A	    - The attribute of the text can be controlled with Ctrl-A.
		    Typing Ctrl-A at any time will cause a menu to be
		    displayed at the bottom of the screen. The menu lists all
		    possible attributes and combinations of the attributes for
		    displaying text.  Simply move to the attribute of choice
		    with the cursor keys and hit return or just type the digit
 		    corresponding to the attribute of choice.  The current text
    		    attribute is always displayed with the Insert/Overwrite
		    indicator at the lower right of the screen.


	BackSpace   - The keyboard backspace key ( Ctrl-H ) causes the
		    character to the left of the cursor to be deleted and the
		    cursor to move one column to the left.

	Delete      - The keyboard Del key causes the character at the cursor
		    position to be deleted and the text field to the right will
		    be shifted one column to the left, leaving the cursor
		    position unchanged.


-Defining Data Fields

	Ctrl-F      - To create or edit a data field move the cursor to the
		    data field location and type Ctrl-F.  A small menu will be
	 	    displayed at the bottom of the screen which allows you to
    		    choose the data type of the field, for editing old fields
		    the current data type is highlighted and hitting a return
		    will leave the type unchanged.  To select the data type use
		    the cursor keys or type the first letter of the type you
		    choose.
 		      Each data type has slightly different characteristics
                    which must be specified.  Simply enter the data field
		    characteristics as prompted on the various screens. Some
 		    characteristics are not required, such as the help text,
		    while others will default to some common values.  After all
	 	    the information is correct type Ctrl-Z to return to your
		    screen.  The data field will be displayed as underscores
		    with the attribute you chose in the definition for the
		    field.



-Block Operations

	Ctrl-B	    - All block operations are done with Ctrl-B.  To begin
		    a block operation move the cursor to the upper left of
		    the block to be operated on and type Ctrl-B.  A message
		    at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to move the
		    cursor to the lower right of the block and type Ctl-B.
		    Once this is done the block to operate on is defined. If
		    the block you're trying to mark is not a valid block for
		    some reason, maybe a data field crosses a block boundry,
		    the bell will sound and a prompt will be displayed allowing
		    you to move the lower right definition of the block. If
		    you need to move the upper left of the block use the
		    keyboard function key PF1 to move back a level in the block
		    operation.
		      If the block you defined was a valid block a small menu
		    will be displayed at the bottom of the screen which allows
		    you to choose one of two block operations, Move or Delete.
		    The default is always to move the block, to choose the
		    Delete operation move the menu cursor with the cursor keys
		    or simply type a 'D'. If you choose to delete the block you
		    will be prompted to confirm the delete, doing so will cause
		    the text and data fields in the block to be deleted from
		    the screen.  If you choose not to confirm the delete the
		    block operation is aborted.
		      To move the defined block choose the Move option on the
		    menu.  A message will be displayed prompting you to move
		    the cursor to the upper left of the destination region and
		    type Ctrl-B.  If the destination region is valid the block
		    will be displayed in the new location and you will be
		    prompted to confirm the move.  If you confirm the move the
		    move is completed and the screen is redisplayed. If after
 		    seeing where the block will be placed you want to change
		    the destination type the keyboard function key PF1 and
		    you will be allowed to change the destination region.


		    Note:  The PF1 key will always back you up one level in the
			   block operation.

-Copying a Field Definition

	Crtl-V      - To copy a field definiton move the cursor to the data
		    field to be copied and type Ctrl-V.  This loads the
		    definition into a temporary buffer.  The definition will
		    will remain in the buffer until another Ctrl-V is typed.
		    If Ctrl-V is typed while the cursor is not in a data field
		    the bell sounds and no action is taken, the buffer is not
		    disturbed.

	Ctrl-G	    - To write a field definition saved in the temporary
		    buffer with Ctrl-V move the cursor to the location of the
		    new data field and type Ctrl-G. To make multiple copies
		    of a data field you need only save the definition once
		    and use Ctrl-G any number of times to write the definition
		    in different locations.  If the data field won't fit at
		    the cursor position the bell will sound and no action
		    will be taken.


-Exiting the Editor

	Ctrl-Z      - To exit the editor type Ctrl-Z at any time your in the
		    Fpaint screen.  A new screen will be displayed over your
		    screen which allows you to change the filename, screen
		    size, and the menu line for your screen.  Once all the
		    information is correct on the screen type another Ctrl-Z.
		    Your screen will be redisplayed and a small menu will
		    allow you to either leave the data fields ordered as
		    they were when you started the session ( the definition
		    order if a new screen ), or change the data field order.
 		      If you choose to reorder the fields you are then prompted
    		    to move the cursor to each data field and hit the PF1
		    function key.  After the last field is marked the editor
		    completes the exit procedure.



-Aborting the Edit

	Ctrl-C      - To exit the editor at any time without saving any changes
		    type Ctrl-C.
