Abstract:  RENBR modifies the statement numbers in FORTRAN  programs  so
that   these   statement   numbers   become   sequential   and/or  forms
cross-referenced listings of FORTRAN programs.   The  RENBR  program  is
itself  written  entirely  in FORTRAN.  The portion of the RENBR program
which  does  the  renumbering  and/or  forms  the  listing   is   system
independent.   Only  the  routines  which open and close files and which
process the instructions which are typed by the user would  need  to  be
modified  for  use of this program on other computers.  Several versions
of the user interaction routines are supplied.

RENBR can process  programs  and  routines  which  are  written  in  the
FORTRAN-77 language, in the FORTRAN-IV language, and in some dialects of
the FORTRAN-II language.  RENBR can also process programs  and  routines
which  use  the  FORTRAN language extensions allowed by version 7 of the
FORTRAN-10 and FORTRAN-20 compilers.

Two versions of RENBR  are  supplied.   One  of  these  versions  stores
characters  in  FORTRAN-66  Hollerith  arrays.  The other version stores
characters in FORTRAN-77 character strings.  The version of RENBR  which
uses Hollerith arrays is recommended when using either the FORTRAN-10 or
FORTRAN-20 compilers, since this version requires much  less  processing
time.   A  program is provided which converts the version of RENBR which
uses Hollerith arrays to the version which uses character strings.
