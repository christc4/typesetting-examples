1.0  SUMMARY

     DECnet-20 V2.1 for the 2020 consists of one 1600 BPI 9 track 
magnetic tape distributed in DUMPER format.  This version of the
DECnet-20 product set provides the following features :

      o  A DECnet Network File Transfer capability, enhanced
         in V2.1 to allow printing of remote files on remote
         hosts

      o  All maintenance fixes for version 2.0


     The  following  manuals  provide  generic DECnet information
that may be useful:

      o  DIGITAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, General  Description,
         Order   Number  AA-H202A-TK.   Provides  a  general
         overview of DNA.


      o  DDCMP,  Order  Number  AA-D599A-TC.    Provides   a
         complete  specification  of  the  data  link  level
         protocol used in DNA.

      o  NSP, Order Number AA-D600A-TC.  Provides a complete
         specification of the Network Services Protocol.

      o  DAP, Order Number AA-D601B-TC.  Provides a complete
         specification  of  the  Data Access Protocol.  This
         revision of the specification is not  available  as
         of this writing.


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  DECnet File Transfer Utilities

     Two programs, NFT and  FAL,  provide  the  DECnet  file
transfer  capability  for  DECsystem-20.  Access to files on
remote systems from the local TOPS-20 system is provided  by
NFT  (Network  File  Transfer).  Commands provided are COPY,
SET  DEFAULT,  INFORMATION,  SUBMIT,  DIRECTORY,  PRINT  and
DELETE.   FAL  (File  Access  Listener)  acts  as the DECnet
server process which provides  access  to  the  local  hosts
TOPS-20 file system for remote network nodes.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     Major problems with DECnet-20 Version 2.1,  that  might
prevent successful installation or operation, are documented
in the DECnet-20 Beware File.  This file, DECNET.BWR, is  in
the  documentation  save  set on the distribution tape.  The
Beware File is mandatory reading prior  to  installing  this
product.

     Minor  problems  with  this  version  that  should  not
interfere   with   normal  operation  of  this  product  are
documented here.



3.1  NFT/FAL Bugs And Deficiencies

3.1.1  Truncation Of Byte Count In DIRECTORY Output -

     A DIRECTORY command truncates the byte count  and  byte
size  field  to  10  characters.   Thus,  if  the byte count
requires more than 10 character positions, some  digits  may
not be displayed.


3.1.2  No Facility To Set Default SUBMIT Switches -

     The NFT SUBMIT command has no switches, and there is no
way  to  override  any  default switches on the remote node.
The standard defaults for the SUBMIT  command,  provided  by
the remote system, will be obtained.


3.2  Incorrect Wildcard Handling In COPY Command

In the case of an NFT COPY command of the type:

        NFT> COPY *B*.* (TO) *B*.*.-1

the file that  is  actually  copied  to  has  an  additional
character in its name, as indicated by the COPY response:

            ABC.DEF => ABBC.DEF

     For V2.1, all other  known  wildcarding  problems  have
been fixed Also, default file types work.

3.3  NCP/NCU (NETCON) Bugs And Deficiencies


3.3.1  Incorrect Line Counter Output -

     The line counter display provided by NETCON incorrectly
shows counter values over 127 as a number in the range 65000
to  65535.   To  reduce  the  probability  of  this  problem
occuring  set  the  logging  interval  to  a value that will
ensure the line counters are read  and  zeroed  before  they
reach 128.



3.4  TOPS-20 NSP Bugs And Deficiencies


3.4.1  MTOPR Disconnect Function Always Aborts -

     The MTOPR .MOCLZ function with a zero disconnect reason
code  does  not  do a synchronous disconnect when used after
sending data in stream mode.  Any data  which  has  not  yet
been transmitted by NSP at the time the MTOPR is issued will
be lost.  The CLOSF JSYS  will  work  properly  under  these
circumstances.


4.0  Format Of DECnet-20 Distribution Tape

     The DECnet-20 V2.1 Distribution Tape,  QTD20,  consists
of the following five save sets:


DUMPER Save Set Name Directory


Documentation Files for DECnet-20 V2.1 PS:<DECNET>

Binary Files for DECnet-20 V2.1 PS:<SUBSYS>

Source Files for DECnet-20 V2.1 PS:<DECNET>

4.1  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you are upgrading your DECsystem 2020 from TOPS-20 V4. DECnet V2 to
TOPS-20 V4 DECnet V2.1 please perform the following steps prior to
beginning  the instructions in the TOPS-20 DECnet-20 Programmer's Guide 
and Operations Manual (Order Number AD-5091B-T1).  If you are doing a new
Installation of TOPS20-V4 DECnet V2.1  go on  to Step 2.

1) Check to see if the directory PS:<NEW-SUBSYS> exists on your structure.
This area will be used to hold the DECnet V2.1 Binary Files.  This directory
should have been created by the monitor at the time of your installation
for use when updating to newer versions of software.  If this directory does
not exist you must create it.

	@ENABLE
	$^ECREATE PS:<NEW-SUBSYS>
	[New]
	$$WORK  +INF
	$$PERM  +INF
	$$FILES-ONLY
	$$
	$DISABLE
	@

2) Create the directory PS:<NEW-DECNET> if this is an Upgrade or
PS:<DECNET> if this is a new installation, this area will contain the 
DECnet files for Version 2.1.  

	@ENABLE
	$^ECREATE PS:<NEW-DECNET> or PS:<DECNET>
	[New]
	$$WORK 2000
	$$PERM 2000
	$$PROTECTION 774000
	$$USER 4747
	$$PASSWORD XXX
	$$
	$DISABLE
	@

3)Use DUMPER to restore files from tape to disk.  Mount the DECnet 
Version 2.1 distribution tape on an available drive.  

Use the INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS command to determine if tape
allocation is enabled for your system.

	(We will use MTA0 in the examples)

If your installation does not include the tape allocation enabled
feature:

Enter:

	@ENABLE
	$ASSIGN MTA0:
	$DUMPER
	DUMPER>TAPE MTA0:
	DUMPER>REWIND
DOC file for DECnet-20 V2.1 (For the 2020)            Page 7


Or if your installation includes the tape allocation enabled feature:

Enter:

	@ENABLE
	$MOUNT TAPE logical name:
	[logical name: assigned to MT0]
	$DUMPER
	DUMPER>TAPE logical-name:
	DUMPER>REWIND


NOTE: If this is a new installation  PS:<DECNET> and
PS:<SUBSYS> should be used in place of  PS:<NEW-DECNET> and PS:<NEW-SUBSYS>.

			

	DUMPER>ACCOUNT (OF RESTORED FILES FROM) SYSTEM-DEFAULT <RET>
	(Restores files with the system (SYSTEM-DEFAULT) account).

	DUMPER>RESTORE (TAPE FILES) PS:<*>*.*.*  (TO) PS:<NEW-DECNET> <RET>
	(Restores Documentation files.)

	DUMPER>RESTORE (TAPE FILES) PS:<*>*.*.* (TO) PS:<NEW-SUBSYS> <RET>
	(Restores Binary Files.)

	DUMPER>RESTORE (TAPE FILES) PS:<*>*.*.* (TO) PS:<NEW-DECNET> <RET>
	(Restores Source Files.)

	DUMPER>RESTORE (TAPE FILES) PS:<*>*.*.* (TO) PS:<UETP.LIB> <RET>
	(Restores Acceptance Files)
	
	DUMPER>RESTORE (TAPE FILES) PS:<*>*.*.* (TO) PS:<UETP.DECNET> <RET>
	(Restores Sample Files.)

	End of Saveset

If you do not have tape allocation enabled to unload the tape:

Enter:

	DUMPER>REWIND
	DUMPER>UNLOAD
	DUMPER>EXIT
	$DEASSIGN MTA0:
	$DISABLE
	@
Or If you have tape allocation enabled:

Enter: 

	DUMPER>REWIND
	DUMPER>EXIT
	$DISMOUNT TAPE logical name
	$DISABLE
	@

4) Editing SYSJOB.RUN and 4-CONFIG.CMD

 You must find out where the current version of these files exist.
Do a directory of the areas PS:<NEW-SYSTEM> and PS:<SYSTEM> to 
see where they are.  If SYSJOB.RUN is in both PS:<NEW-SYSTEM> and
PS:<SYSTEM> the one that has to be edited is PS:<NEW-SYSTEM> as this
is the current version.  The same holds true for the 4-CONFIG.CMD.

When you have determined where the current version of these files
are you can proceed to the Programmer's Guide and Operations Manual
Chapter 10, Section 10.1 Installation Procedure for further instructions
on editing these files.  

Before you start the Installation and Verfication Procedures in 
Chapter 10, Section 10.2  in the Programmer's Guide and Operators Manual
make sure you have read Section 4.2 of this file. Once you have
completed all tests and have verified that the software has been
installed correctly return to this document Section 4.3 , Final
Installation for instructions on transfering files to appropriate
areas. 



4.2 INSTALLATION AND VERIFICATION PROCEDURES:



PAGE 10-15 (Programmer's Guide and Operations Manual)

Step 1:

5.0  SUGGESTIONS

5.1  DECnet Phase III Node Name Compatibility

     In DECnet Phase III all  node  names  must  include  at
least  one alphabetic character to syntactically distinguish
them from node addresses.  The alphabetic character need not
be  the  first  character,  and  remaining characters may be
either  alphabetic  or   numeric,   6   character   maximum.
Customers are urged to adhere to this convention when naming
Phase II nodes, thus  providing  upward  compatibility  with
DECnet Phase III.


All maintenance fixes for V2.0 have been incorporated into V2.1
Hence, no patch installation is required by specialist or customer.
