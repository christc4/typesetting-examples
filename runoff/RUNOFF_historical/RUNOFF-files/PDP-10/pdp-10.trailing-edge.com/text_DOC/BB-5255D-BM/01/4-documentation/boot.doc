BOOT.DOC -- Changes from V6(131) to V7(134)
January 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOT is used to load the TOPS-20  Monitor  from  disk  into  KL10/KS10
memory.   On  normal  system startup, BOOT is automatically loaded and
started by RSX20F, and will load the TOPS-20 Monitor without  operator
intervention.

BOOT is also responsible for dumping  KL10/KS10  memory  after  system
malfunction, for later analysis.

BOOT version 7(134) runs only with TOPS-20 Release 4.

BOOT is documented in the following documents:

     DECSYSTEM-20 Software Installation Guide

     DECSYSTEM-20 Operator's Guide



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

BOOT will look at location .JBSYM in a file to determine how  much  of
the  file  to  read.   All pages up to the end of the symbol table are
read, which is what the Release  4  monitor  requires.   This  can  be
disabled  by  explicitly  giving  core  limits.   (Using  /A or /(m,n)
switches.)

The core limit to be read in by BOOT has been raised from page 377  to
the page just preceeding BOOT.

There is a new switch /A which indicates that BOOT is to load  all  of
an  EXE file.  Thus /A is equivilant to /(0,n), where n is the highest
page preceeding BOOT.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

BOOT will load the TOPS-20 Monitor from disk only.

This version of BOOT can not load monitors prior to version 4.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run BOOT
BOT7.DOC                                                        Page 3


BOOT requires the file to be loaded, usually ps:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE, be
present on the disk.  The default file is PS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing BOOT

BOOT is distributed on the floppy diskettes containing  the  front-end
software.   It  is  installed  in  the  front-end  area  during system
installation, (see DECSYSTEM-20 Software Installation Guide).


4.3  Files Needed to Build BOOT

     BOOT.MAC
     KLPRE.MAC
     PMT.MAC
     KSPRE.MAC


4.4  Instructions for Building BOOT

The procedure for building BOOT is complex.  It is suggested that BOOT
only be built by submitting the Batch file BOOT.CTL.


4.5  Special Considerations

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

See external changes.  Also  page  allocation  inside  BOOT  was  made
easier by a macro.  The origin of BOOT is now page 777.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
