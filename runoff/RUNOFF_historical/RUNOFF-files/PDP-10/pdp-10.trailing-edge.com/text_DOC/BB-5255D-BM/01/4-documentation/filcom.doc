FILCOM.DOC -- Changes from V21(43) to V21A(55)
June 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of FILCOM resolves several SPRs.

This release will run on all supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

This release includes 10 edits:

Edit #

44     Consider carriage-return to be an EOL character if  it  is  not
       followed  by  LF,  VT,  of  FF.  This gets underlining right in
       update mode.  SPR # 10-22466.

45     Exit when through processing  a  command  if  ^Z  was  used  to
       terminate it.  SPR # 10-22854.

46     Make buffers for headers  big  enough  to  handle  the  longest
       possible filespecs.  SPR # 10-23644.

47     Make all the month names 3 characters  and  lowercase.   SPR  #
       10-23642.

50     Accept a  line-terminating  character  in  lieu  of  a  closing
       right-bracket.  SPR # 10-23642.

51     Keep creation dates in the headers lined up.  Note:  this  edit
       supercedes edit 46.  SPR # 10-23642.

52     Always produce a file in update mode,  even  if  there  are  no
       differences.  SPR # 10-23873.

53     If second input filespec was a magtape, and /W, /E, of  /X  was
       specified, no comparison was done and the first file was merely
       listed.  SPR # 10-23863.

54     Finish teaching FILCOM  about  large  (more  than  a  halfword)
       addresses in EXE files.  SPR # 10-25025.

55     Prevent sporadic bogus differences  with  line-numbered  files.
       SPR # 10-25063.

FILCOM.DOC -- Changes from V20A(17) to V21(43)
January 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a release of FILCOM containing bug fixes and support  for  EXE
files and SFDs.

This release will run on all supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

This release includes 20 edits:

Edit #

20     Checks for double = in binary mode.

21     Forces /1L if /U is seen to print one line changes only.

22     Makes FILCOM able to handle files larger than 2048 DISK blocks.

23     Makes  FILCOM  get  the  job's  project  number  if  only   the
       programmer number is specified, and the job's programmer number
       if only the project number is specified.

24     Improve error messages for file not found etc.

25     Add support for EXE file comparisons.

26     Change "FOO:  Z" to "FOO:  BLOCK 1".

27     Allow EXE files to be printed out as SHR files are.

30     Take  a  quick  exit  if  /Q  is  used  and  a  difference   is
       encountered.

31     Clear internal buffers between commands.

32     Fix bad address calculation in SAV file expansion code.

33     Handle lines with only line sequence numbers  as  blank  lines.
       Also,  handle page marks and BASIC-format line sequence numbers
       correctly.

34     Fix bugs in update mode comparisons introduced by Edit 21.

35     Add command scanner and other support for handling SFDs in file
       specifications.
FLM21.DOC                                                       Page 7


36     Make the header lines contain  more  accurate  information  and
       include SFD information.

37     Compare EXE files correctly when  their  maps  differ  and  the
       second file is the shorter of the two.

40     Unused.

41     Do not write  a  null  output  file  when  no  differences  are
       encountered on a comparison.

42     Allow the output file to have a null extension.

43     Handle EXE files with more than 1000 pages correctly.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

When a SHR/HGH file is  being  printed  out,  it's  origin  is  always
assumed to be 400000, even if it begins at some other core location.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are no changes in the installation instructions.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

One new switch has been added to FILCOM.  The /E switch indicates that
the current file is in EXE format.  This switch is assumed if the file
has an extension of EXE.  If a file is in EXE format, but has  neither
an  extension of EXE nor a /E switch, then the file will be treated as
if it were a straight binary file and will be compared accordingly.

File specifications may now include SFDs  for  the  output  and  input
files.   The  FILCOM  header  line  has  been  changed  to include SFD
information and more information  about  where  the  input  files  are
actually  being  accessed  from,  regardless  of logical names, ersatz
devices, etc.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
