FTP.DOC -- Changes from V101B(26) to V4(30)
March, 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

FTP, FTPSER and FTSCTL are programs which allow users to transfer files
over the ARPANET.  FTP is the user half of the File Transfer Protocol.
FTPSER and FTSCTL are the server half of the File Transfer Protocol.

FTP version 4(30), FTPSER version 4(2) and  FTSCTL  version  4(1)  run
only on Release 4 of TOPS-20AN.

FTP depends on there being a File  Transfer  Protocol  server  at  the
remote site.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The CWD command now accepts directory names  instead  of  user  names.
This  change  was necessary to provide access to structures other than
PS:.
