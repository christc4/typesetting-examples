June 1979

address space.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no new bugs in version 2 of PFH and no new deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install PFH.EXE on SYS.  Do not delete PFH.VMX as it will be  required
should the installation drop back to a monitor previous to 7.00.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

MAKPFH has been eliminated;  PFH is a PSECT.
