2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

THE FOLLOWING VISIBLE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE:

AT KSYS TIME, ALL LEVELS OF SUBJOBS WILL BE KILLED.

WHEN OPSER IS RUN VIA INITIA TO AUTOMATICALLY  RUN  AN  AUTO
FILE,  THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE NAME OF
THE AUTO FILE TO PROCESS.

     1.  IF RUN ON THE "OPR" LINE  (I.E.   MONGEN  ANSWERED,
         USUALLY THE "CTY"), USE "SYS:OPR.ATO"

     2.  IF ANY OTHER LOCAL (I.E.   NON-NETWORK)  LINE,  USE
         "SYS:TTYnnn.ATO",  WHERE  "nnn" IS THE LINE NUMBER,
         LEADING ZEROS SUPRESSED (E.G.  "SYS:TTY4.ATO")

     3.  IF THE CTY ON A REMOTE STATION  (USUALLY  LINE  0),
         USE  "SYS:OPRn.ATO",  WHERE "n" IS THE NODE NUMBER,
         LEADING ZEROS SURPRESSED (E.G.  "SYS:OPR31.ATO")

     4.  IF ANY OTHER NETWORK  LINE,  USE  "SYS:nnnlll.ATO",
         WHERE  "nnn"  IS  THE  NODE NUMBER AND "lll" IS THE
         LINE   NUMBER,   LEADING   ZEROS   SUPPLIED   (E.G.
         "SYS:031042.ATO" FOR LINE 42 ON NODE 31.)




3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES (OR  CHARACTERISTICS)  OF
     JOBS  THAT  MAY  RECEIVE  COMMANDS  THROUGH AUTO FILES.
     THESE JOBS MUST USE CONVENTIONS  SIMILAR  TO  THE  ONES
     USED  BY  BATCON,  LPTSPL,  OR OTHER SUPPORTED PROGRAMS
     THAT ARE DESIGNED TO RUN AS SUBJOBS OF OPSER.  THAT IS,
     THEY MUST HIBERNATE ON TTY INPUT OR GO QUICKLY INTO TTY
     INPUT WAIT.  DOC FILES THAT ACCOMPANIED OPSERS  5A(67),
     5B(73)  AND 5C(110) EXPLAINED THE HISTORY AND NATURE OF
     THE  TIMING  PROBLEMS  THAT  CAN  ARISE,  BUT   IT   IS
                                                      Page 3


     SUFFICIENT  TO  SAY  THAT,  ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY IS
     SMALL, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LINES READ FROM AN AUTO FILE
     DIRECTED  TO  A  SUBJOB  THAT  EITHER HAS SET HIBERNATE
     ENABLE BIT ON TTY INPUT,  SUCH  AS  MCS,  OR  DOES  NOT
     FOLLOW THOSE CONVENTIONS, COULD BE LOST.

     CONSECUTIVE HOURS OR LONGER.  SPR 10-27243

112  IF AN .ATO FILE  HAS  SEQUENCE  NUMBERS,  THE  SEQUENCE

     10-26985
