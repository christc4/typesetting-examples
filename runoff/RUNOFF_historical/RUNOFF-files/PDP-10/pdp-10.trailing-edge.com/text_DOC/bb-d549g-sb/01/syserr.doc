SYSERR.DOC -- Changes from V10A(555) to V12A(1013)
August 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

SYSERR is a program used to list the  contents  of  the  system  error
file.   It  is the report generating portion of the DECsystem-10 Error
Detection, Recovery, and Reporting package.

SYSERR Version 12A(1013) runs on TOPS10 Version 603A.

SYSERR Version 12A(1013) requires DAEMON Version 16(612)

SYSERR uses HELPER and SCAN.

Documentation on how to run SYSERR and descriptions of report  formats
may be found in the TOPS10 and TOPS20 SYSERR Manual (AA-D533A-TK).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

This  release  of  the  SYSERR  package  includes  the  following  new
functions:

     1.  Re-order signal names for the KLERROR report to get all error
         signals to the top.

     2.  Add /SEQuence switch to extract individual entries.

     3.  Add /BRief switch for 2 line entry format.

     4.  New page headers contain SYSERR version #, and system S/N.

     5.  /NDEV switch handles generic device names.

     6.  Supports MTA thru MTD (8 drives) and RPA thru RPD (8 drives).

     7.  /NOW switch to support real-time error logging.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There is a problem with MASSBUS  disk  unit  errors  where  the  drive
registers  may not be saved.  This causes an error message from SYSERR
to be printed on the terminal.  The message is as  follows;   %ILLEGAL
MASSBUS  UNIT TYPE -- ABORTING ENTRY.  SYSERR will then continue to do
the rest of its processing in the  normal  manner.   This  problem  is
fixed  by  MCO   8153  which  is  in  6.03A  and later versions of the
monitor.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  

SYSERR  V3B  contains  several  external  changes  which   are   fully
documented  in  the Software Notebooks as referenced in section 1.3 of
this document.  Included here are brief summaries of these changes.


2.1.1  

Massbus Device Error Reporting is the most significant external change
in  this  release.   The report generated in the listing file contains
the device name, media ID including  the  structure  name,  User's  ID
program name and filename, all of the controller (RH10) status and all
of the device (RS04 or RP04) status including all of the registers  in
the device.  Sample listings and descriptions are found in SYSERR.RNO.
SYR3B.DOC                                                      Page 23


2.1.2  

SYSERR V3B automatically looks for and processes  the  extended  error
files  ERROR.X01 thru ERROR.X77 created by DAEMON V10 and later.  Upon
detecting an error using ERROR.SYS, DAEMON  begins  saving  the  error
information  in  ERROR.X01.   SYSERR  will  look for these files after
encountering EOF on ERROR.SYS  and  start  processing  extended  error
files  according  to the same commands after informing the user on his
(her) terminal and making a notation in the output file.


2.1.3  

The summary listings included at the  end  of  all  output  files  now
include  the  name  and  creation  date  of  all  extended error files
processed and a breakdown of system reloads  by  type  indicating  the
number  of  each type which have occured.  Also the listings for error
counts by device only include those devices which had errors  and  not
all devices on the system.


2.1.4  

The default output file  name  has  been  changed  from  ERROR.LST  to
XXXXXX.LST  where  XXXXXX  is the main switch specified in the command
such as /DSKALL or /CPUPER etc.  This allows multiple passes of SYSERR
to not overwrite the defaulted output file.


2.1.5  

A new /STR:NAME Switch has been  added  to  allow  only  those  errors
concerning  a  specific  structure  regardless  of  the  device it was
mounted on.  This switch is only applicable to disk or massbus units.


2.1.6  

SYSERR no longer needs to  be  assembled  to  build  a  site-dependent
configuration.


2.1.7  

SYSERR V3B now closes the input and  output  files  when  detecting  a
fatal error and preserves the reports generated before the error.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

SYSERR no longer needs to assembled on-site  to  generate  the  proper
configuration.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Internal changes in SYSERR V. 3B include those to support the external
changes  and  definition  of  the  full  range  of  error codes.  This
definition was in order to prevent both DEC  and  customer  using  the
same  error  codes  in  the  future.   The definition is documented in
ERROR.RNO.

SYSERR.DOC -- V3
December 1973



1.0     SUMMARY

        This release provides for Magtape Error Reporting and  handles
        multi-controller  (DPX,FHX,MTX)  tables to be generated on the
        basis of system configuration.

        SYSERR version 3 will run on all 5.06 and later monitors.   It
        has  been  tested  on  5.06  and  later  monitors,  and  fully
        supersedes all previous versions.  SYSERR version 3 works with
        DAEMON  version  7 under 5.06 monitors, but magtape errors are
        not reported.  To obtain reports  on  magtape  errors,  SYSERR
        must be used with DAEMON version 10 or later and 5.07 or later
        monitors.

        For further documentation see SYSERR.RNO, and ERROR.RNO in the
        Software Notebooks.



2.0     EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1     SYSERR version 3 incorporates several new switches to  support
        magtape error reporting.  These include:

        /MAGALL  -  list all magtape entries
        /MAGPAR  -  list magtape parity error entries
        /MAGPER  -  list magtape performance entries
        /MAGSUM  -  list magtape summary statistics


2.2     New Performance Switches

        In addition two  switches  have  been  added  to  allow  error
        criteria   specification   for   performance  entries.   These
        switches are:

        /SRE:#   -  SOFT read error threshold (default 4)
        /SWE:#   -  SOFT write error threshold (default 7)

        When the  user  specifies  /MAGPER  he  will  receive  magtape
        performance  entries  which  have  4 read errors or more and 7
        write errors or  more.   These  default  values  are  assembly
        parameters  called SREDEF and SWEDEF respectively.  The use of
        the /SRE:# and /SWE:# switches override the default value  for
        that  run.  This allows dynamic control of error thresholds by
        the user.
SYR3.DOC                                                       Page 27


2.3     Expanded /DEV Switch

        Generic devices may be  specified  when  using  the  /DEV:NAME
        switch.   Thus  /DEV:DPA will list all DPA controller entries,
        while  /DEV:DP  will  list  all   DP   controller's   entries.
        /DEV:FHA0 will continue to function as normal.



2.4     New /ID:NAME switch

        A new /ID:NAME switch has been added  to  allow  selection  of
        entries  on the basis of the pack or reel identification.  The
        user can specify a single pack or reel  name  and  only  those
        entries corresponding to that particular id will be listed.

2.5     Magtape Error Entry

        The first new entry type is  magtape  error  (code  20).   The
        format of the entry when listed is as follows:


        ***************************************************
        MAGTAPE ERROR(CODE 20) LOGGED ON 16-JUL-73
        AT 10:37:30      MONITOR UPTIME WAS 3:55:05
        ***************************************************
        MAGTAPE PARAMETERS
         UNIT NAME:  MTA0
         REEL IDENTIFICATION: REELID
         OPERATION:  READ MULTIRECORD
         STATUS:    800 BPI, EVEN PARITY
        ERROR DIAGNOSIS
         RECOVERABLE TAPE PAR ERR,
        ERROR ANALYSIS
         ERROR LOCATION: RECORD 37. OF FILE 10.
         CONI TMS AT ERROR: 0,20004 = TAPE PAR ERR,
         CONI TMS AT END: 0,104 = NO ERROR BITS DETECTED
         RETRIES PERFORMED: 4.

2.5.1   Unit Name - The Unit Name is the physical name of the  magtape
        drive.  MTA0 represents unit 0 on controller A.

2.5.2   Reel Indentification - The Reel  Identification  is  the  name
        supplied  to  the  monitor at the time of mounting.  It is not
        contingent on any label information on the tape.

2.5.3   Operation - The operation is the activity of the drive at  the
        time of the error.  Examples are read, write, read compare.

2.5.4   Status - This is essentially a text explanation of the  status
        bits found on in the CONI word in the entry.  Examples are odd
        parity, 7 or 9 track, write locked, etc.
SYR3.DOC                                                       Page 28


2.5.5   Error Diagnosis - The error diagnosis section is a  definition
        of the cause of the magtape error.  It tells whether the error
        was found to be recoverable or non-recoverable.  It also gives
        text  explanations of the error bits in the corresponding CONI
        word.  If the error was hardware or relevant software counters
        if the error was software-detected.

2.5.6   Error Analysis

        The breakdown of last magtape error  is  the  pertinent  error
        information about the last magtape error.

2.5.6.1 Error Location - This gives information  as  to  the  physical
        location   on   tape   where  the  error  occurred.   Repeated
        indications of errors in the same location may suggest  a  bad
        spot on tape or incompatibility between drives.

2.5.6.2 Coni Tms At Error - The Coni  Tms  At  Error  gives  an  octal
        typeout  of the CONI tms word as well as a text explanation of
        error bits found on in the CONI tms word.

2.5.6.3 Coni Tms At End - The Coni Tms At End gives an  octal  typeout
        of  the CONI tms at the end of recovery attempts on the drive.
        A text explanation of error bits is also provided.

2.5.6.4 Retries Performed - This is the number of times  recovery  was
        attempted  on  the  unit  before  a successful recovery or the
        error was determined to be non-recoverable.

2.6     Magtape Statistics (code 41)

        The second type of new entry is the magtape statistics  entry.
        The  following  is  an  example  of a magtape statistics entry
        (code 41):

        this sets the level at  which  a  performance  entry  will  be
        considered for listing (default =7).

5.0     INTERNAL CHANGES

5.1     New Entry Types

        Two new entry types have been added to support  magtape  error
        reporting.  These are error code 20 (ER.MAG) and error code 41
        (ER.MSC).  The ER.MAG entry will be similar  in  structure  to
        the  disk  unit  error  while  the  ER.MSC  will be similar in
        structure to the disk statistics entry.

        The user is referred to the document ERROR.RNO in the software
        notebook    specification  section  for  descriptions of entry
        formats in the ERROR.SYS file.

5.2     New /DEV implementation.

        The code for the /DEV switch now recognizes generic names such
        as /DEV:DP for all units on any dp controller and /DEV:MTA for
        all units on controller MTA.

5.4     New /ID:NAME Switch

        Code was added to the logic to allow the selection of  entries
        based  on  the  pack  or  reel  identification name.  The user
        specifies the desired name by putting a /ID:NAME switch in his
        command string.

5.4     Configuration Dependent Tables - SYSERR version 3 creates  its
        tables  according to assembly parameters xxxnum.  Where xxx is
        DPA-DPD  controller   or   FHA-FHD   controller   or   MTA-MTD
        controller.   Each  assembly parameter specifies the number of
        units on the controller.  This cuts down on the size of SYSERR
        and allows multi-controller systems to be supported easily.

5.5     New Date Standard

        SYSERR  version  3  now  is  fully  compatible  with  the  new
        DECSYSTEM-10  date  standard.  This allows use of SYSERR after
        1975 without conversion.
