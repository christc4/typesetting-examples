NETWORK.DOC -- V1(23)
March 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

The NETWORK program lists the nodes in a network in the same format as
the  NODE command.  In addition to the basic functionality of the NODE
command the NETWORK program also allows the user to control  selection
of   nodes   to   be   displayed  by  wildcarded  node  names,  device
attributes(TTY,LPT,CDR,RDA,CDP,PTP,MTA,PTR,MCR), and the ability of  a
node  to  be  a  host.  NETWORK can also list the network topology and
physical link costs.  In addition it can also sort the nodes listed by
node  number.  The output of the program can be controlled by switches
to produce the desired amount of verbousity.  Error messages are given
for  nodes  that  are  specified  and  are  not  found in the network.
Indirect command files are supported.

The NETWORK program does not supercede any other program since this is
the first release.

The NETWORK program will run on version 7.xx and later monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None, since this is the first release.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICENCIES

None at this time.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to the file NETWORK.MAC the  files  SCAN.REL,  HELPER.REL,
SCNMAC.UNV,  MACTEN.UNV,  and  UUOSYM.MAC are needed.  NETWOR requires
SCNMAC version 7(106) (or later) which is included with this tape.  To
compile and load NETWORK type:

     LOAD REL:SCAN,REL:HELPER,DSK:NETWORK<carrage return>

Then type:

     SSAVE NETWORK<carrage return>

Doing this will give a sharable copy of NETWORK.EXE.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     Edit history

[1]  Add the /TYPE: switch to determine a node by it's type
[2]  Fix the core freeing code in CLRDAT to not zero DDT when loaded
[3]  Fix the BLT in CLRDAT so it does not initalize MATCH to -1
[4]  Fix the .ISCAN call so indirect files are illegal if logged out
[5]  Make sure the user can't get into a "*" mode if not logged in
[6]  Take care of the way the NODE. UUO error returns easier now
[7]  Make CONC use .ISLGI in SCAN to be consistant in checking if logged in
[8]  We saved the temps too early in the OFLINE routine
[9]  Make sure that we are able to recover from a node in a "funny" state
[10] Buffer TTY output to reduce monitor overhead
[11] Change "NODE" in output to "Node"
[12] Change the HOST switch to be HOSTESS to be monitor compatable
[13]                                                                  Make the program Reenterable by setting up .JBREN
[14] Change the way TRMOP. errors are handled and fix
     miscellaneous bugs.
[15] Make a zero low segment. Remove EXPs and replace with BLOCK.
[16] Don't allow "*" mode if not logged in...only can do when we
     get control because SCAN has a matching bug, before we get it.
[17] Add a reset instruction because the dispatch through RUNAME
     or RUNAMC in COMCON or the RUN/R command will not do a
     reset unless the program is gotten from DSK. This means
     that if the sharable dormant high seg was there and there
     was no low seg an address check was the result.
[18] Fix OFLINE and correct other error recovery problems
[19] Add the /TOPOLOGY,/COST, and /SORT switches and fix some
     more small bugs including a stack phase problem when we
     used the default case (null node name).



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
