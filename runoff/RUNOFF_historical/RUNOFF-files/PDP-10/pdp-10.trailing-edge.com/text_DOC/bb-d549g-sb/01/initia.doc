INITIA.DOC -- Changes from V7 to V7A(174)
February 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

This release adds the TYPE option for setting terminal  type  and  the
DEFER  option for setting deferred echo mode.  An explanation of these
switches is contained in the HELP file.

This release also  provides  support  for  a  SYSJOB.INI  file.   This
feature is in conjunction with TOPS-10 release 7.01 only.

This version fully supercedes all previous versions and has been fully
tested  under 700 And 701.  It has no known deficiencies.  It corrects
all SPRs received through October 1979.

INITIA is documented in  the  DECsystem-10  Command  Manual  (for  the
command  options)  and  in the operator procedure, INITIA.OPR (for the
file options).

INITIA handles all special  initialization  for  a  terminal.   It  is
invoked  automatically  at  system start-up and whenever a data-set is
answered.   The  user  can  also   invoke   it   to   select   special
initializations.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

146-151   Code improvements

152-155   Add code for skipping tabs in command line

156-162   Add code for setting terminal type

163-164   Add code for LOCATE:NN command

165       Make INITIA run faster at system startup.

166       Accept GALOPR from TTY.INI to run GALAXY Operator interface.

167       At system startup of 701 monitors, read  SYS:SYSJOB.INI  and
          run  the  commands  contained  in  that file on the monitors
          special LDB.   This  is  in  conjunction  with  support  for
          commands  on  that  line  and  other  job control facilities
          available only in 701 monitors.

170       Set special Operator privileges  when  logging  in  jobs  as
          specified  by TTY.INI.  This feature is used by release 4 of
          GALAXY.

172       Re-format output for terminal characteristics

173       Correct a  bug  which  allowed  "INITIA  SETTTY  NO  REMOTE"
          appearing in SWITCH.INI to actually set the line NO REMOTE.

174       Accept DEFER in TTY.INI or SWITCH.INI to set the  echo  mode
          of  the  terminal  to  be  deferred echo.  allow NO DEFER to
          return to normal echoing.

INITIA.DOC -- Changes from V3 to V4
April 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This release updates INITIA to be driven from a file and to be able to
setup all reasonable TRMOP. parameters.  In addition, it now will take
optional commands to control the information which it types.   It  can
now  be  asked to type the current job number and user (if logged in),
NOTICE.TXT,  any  structure  notes  (STR.TXT),  and  the  current  TTY
settings.

This version fully supersedes  all  previous  versions  and  has  been
tested under 5.06 and 5.07/6.01.  It fully supports the DATE75 project
and has no known deficiencies.  It corrects all SPRs received  through
March, 1974 (10-11146).

INITIA is documented in  the  DECsystem-10  command  manual  (for  the
command  options) and in a new operator procedure, INITIA.OPR (for the
file options).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

40       Superseded by edit 47.

41       (SPR 10-11146) Correct default value  of  project  programmer
         number for running FILEX.

42       Convert to use symbols from C.MAC and make resulting  program
         reentrant.

43       Include the processor serial number  in  the  signon  message
         (all processors if dual system).

44       Handle  case  of  being  called  by  a  forced  command.   In
         particular, type "PLEASE LOGIN OR ATTACH".

45       Change the TERMINET-300 option from REENTER to appear on  the
         command line.

46       Add an option to the command line (STRUCTURE) which will type
         out  the  file  STR.TXT[1,4]  from each structure.  This will
         allow the operator to leave  notes  for  the  users  about  a
         structure (such as the date of the last refresh-restore).
INT4.DOC                                                        Page 9


47       Look at file SYS:TTY.INI  to  get  options.   Every  line  is
         examined  to see if it applies to this terminal.  Lines start
         with ALL (applies to all terminals), OTHER (applies  only  if
         no  specific line has yet been found for this terminal), TTYx
         (applies to just TTYx--could also  be  CTY),  and  TTYa-b  or
         TTYa-TTYb (applies to any terminal in the range of a to b).

50       Add TTY.INI options to set all TRMOP.s.

51       Add option HELP and call HELPER.

52       Add option KSYS to  output  the  current  system  going  down
         (timesharing will cease) message if set.

53       Add the job number and user's name if the job is logged in.

54       When automatically logging in a job, type  the  line  ".LOGIN
         p,pn".

55       Add option NOTICE to type SYS:NOTICE.TXT.

56       Add option TTY to type the current settings of  all  readable
         TRMOP.s.   Note  that  this  is  not  designed to display the
         TRMOP.  values so much as to aid the  debugging  process  for
         the  TTY.INI  file.   There  should  be  a general program to
         display the current terminal and job profile  to  handle  all
         parameters in a simple, coherent, and well documented way.

57       When logging a job in automatically, read  SYS:AUXACC.SYS  to
         get its correct search list if possible.

60       Implement option DIAL to control the auto-dialer.

61       Allow continuation and comments in the TTY.INI file.

62       Ensure that the "." is typed only once at exit time.

63       Change to use C.MAC as a universal file.

64       Add the command option NONAME (and the default  value,  NAME)
         to suppress the printing of the system name, processor serial
         numbers, and user's job number and name.

65       Add the command option NORUN to suppress running the operator
         job, if any, specified in SYS:TTY.INI.

66       Add the command  option  NOSETTTY  (and  the  default  value,
         SETTTY)  to suppress setting up the terminal from the command
         file.
INT4.DOC                                                       Page 10


67       If  the  job  is  logged   in,   then   also   look   through
         DSK:SWITCH.INI[,]/PHYSICAL  for lines which start "INITIA" or
         "INITIA:ttyxxxx" where the former is assumed to apply to  any
         tty, and the latter to any tty matching according to the same
         rules as TTY.INI.  Commands in SWITCH.INI override  those  in
         TTY.INI, but not those on the command line.

70       Allow TT as synonomous to  TTY  as  the  generic  prefix  for
         terminals.   Thus,  for  example,  TTY40 can be refered to as
         TT40.   This   agrees   with   the   DEC   command   language
         standardization of device names.

71       Make the default when logged in be  NOSETTTY.   If  the  user
         wishes to setup his terminal from SWITCH.INI, he must include
         a SETTTY in SWITCH.INI.

72       Arrange the order of typeout in response to the  TTY  request
         such  that  the SLAVE, HDX, and REMOTE indicators appear on a
         separate line since they are not changeable by the user.

73       Fix bugs in the above reported by WPI on QAR-1563.

74       Allow .INI lines  to  give  a  list  of  TTYs  or  ranges  by
         enclosing   the  list  in  parenthesis.   For  example:   eak
         (TTY1,TTY3-5,TTY60) options
         INITIA:(TTY1,TTY3-5,TTY60) options



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INTRUCTIONS

Assemble using C as a universal file instead of as a  parameter  file.
Place  onto  SYS:   a file (optional) named TTY.INI which contains the
setup instructions for each terminal in the system.  Remove INITIA.SAV
from SYS:  and add file INITIA.SHR (note the change of extension).

Note that it may now be desirable to set most or all terminals  to  be
automatically  "INITIAed"  at  system  startup.   In  monitors  before
6.01/5.07 this can result in job capacity exceeded messages to some of
the  terminals.   In 6.01/5.07, the excess INITIA commands are delayed
until job slots are available.  This can still result in the following
unexpected  result  for  users;   that  if users start trying to LOGIN
while the system is flooded with INITIAs, they will get  job  capacity
exceeded messages.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Deduce from examining the other jobs on the system whether  there  are
any detached jobs.  If not, then suppress the "or attach" message when
responding to the forced ".HELLO" command (dataset answer).

Speed up initial system start-up by reading the  TTY.INI  and  STR.TXT
and  NOTICE.TXT  files into the high segment and using them from there
instead of having every terminal reading them simultaneously.
