HELPER.DOC -- Changes from version 4 to 5
October, 1973

Copyright 1973, Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.





1.0  SUMMARY

1.1  This release extends HELPER to look at device HLP:,  to
     read  sequence numbered files, and to improve its error
     messages.  It also adds an entry point so that  it  can
     be  invoked from FORTRAN-10 and COBOL programs.  HELPER
     version 5 corrects all SPRs  received  through  October
     10, 1973 (10-11567).

1.2  HELPER version 5 runs on all  monitors.   It  has  been
     tested on 5.06.  There are no known deficiencies.  This
     version fully supports the DATE75 project.

1.3  HELPER  version  5   is   documented   in   a   program
     specification in the Software Notebooks.

2.0  CHANGES

36   (SPR 10-9713) Handle  sequenced  files.   Also  add  an
     error  message  in case of I/O errors.  This message is
     "%HLRIOE I/O ERROR READING HELP  FILE;   I'M  SORRY,  I
     CAN'T HELP YOU".

37   (SPR 10-11567) Look on device HLP:  before  looking  on
     SYS:.   This  allows  all help files to be removed from
     SYS:  which should speed up LOOKUPs.

40   Add an alternate entry  point  "HELPER"  which  can  be
     called from FORTRAN-10 or from COBOL with one argument,
     the name of the program in SIXBIT.

41   Improve the error message issued when the help file can
     not  be  found.   It now reads "%HLRNHF NO HELP FILE ON
     SYS:;  I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU".






3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     None.






4.0  CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     None.






5.0  SUGGESTIONS
