1.0    SUMMARY

1.1    This release fixes a bug associated with DATE-75.  It
       also  implements  two  suggestions  received on SPRs.
       The first adds a switch  /NAME  (defaults  to  ersatz
       name)  which  is used to specify the name for .RBSPL.
       The second improves the error message  which  results
       if a non-privileged user tries to create a UFD.

1.2    This program will run on any 5- or  6-series  monitor
       and has been tested under 6.01/5.07.  It depends upon
       SCAN version 7 and WILD version 7.  It has no DATE-75
       dependency  and  has no known deficiencies.  It cures
       all   SPRs   received   through    September,    1974
       (10-14,113).

1.3    CREDIR is documented in this file and in the software
       notebook descriptions of the 6.01/5.07 monitor.

1.4    FUNCTION OF CREDIR
       This program is designed to create directories in  an
       easy and reliable fashion.  It will construct SFDs on
       all structures selected including  any  higher  level
       directories  needed.   If  run  under  [1,2], it will
       create UFDs on  any  selected  structure  or  set  of
       structures.   The  user  can  specify  the quotas for
       these UFDs via either switches or a dialogue.  CREDIR
       is   particularly  useful  for  creating  the  ersatz
       directories supported by 6.01/5.07, since  these  are
       not  created by the disk refresher.  All the operator
       need do is specify the names of the ersatz devices he
       wants  created  and  CREDIR  will  create them on all
       structures for that ersatz device (typically the  SYS
       search list).  As each directory is created, the user
       is informed of the name, unit, and protection.

2.0    CHANGES

101    Fix  a  DATE-75  deficiency  which  would  cause  the
       created directory's creation date to be bad after the
       first directory created.

102    (SPR 10-14,113) Add  switch  /NAME:   which  takes  a
       possibly  quoted  sixbit  string  of  one word as its
       value.  If not specified, dialogue mode  will  prompt
       for  it.  If not set by the user when doing an ersatz
       device, the default is the ersatz  device  name.   If
       set  for  any  of  these  reasons then the spool name
       (.RBSPL) of the bottom directory created will be  set
       to  the specified name.  This will print in DIRECTory
       listings, giving a mnemonic.

103    (SPR  10-13,898)   Improve   the   message   when   a
       non-privileged  user  tries  to  create  a  UFD to be
       ?CRRMBC MUST BE [1,2] TO CREATE A UFD.
3.0    KNOWN DEFICIENCIES

       None.


4.0    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       CREDIR is assembled with C.MAC as  a  universal  file
       and   is   loaded   with   SCAN.REL,   WILD.REL,  and
       HELPER.REL.  It should then be SSAVEd on SYS:.  There
       is also a short help file.


5.0    SUGGESTIONS

5.1    Add a way to put ersatz devices on  only  a  selected
       set of file structures.

5.2    Observe /NOCREATE if set.

                  Extracts from Version 1





2.0    EXTERNAL DESCRIPTION

       To use CREDIR, simply RUN it from SYS:.  It will  ask
       for the name of a directory.  You have three choices:
       ersatz device mode, switch mode, and dialogue mode.

       To enter dialogue mode, respond to the question  with
       a device and no directory (but not an ersatz device).
       CREDIR will then loop requesting a  directory.   Each
       time,  respond  with  the  directory  name  in square
       brackets.  The standard UFD  project  and  programmer
       defaults can be used.  Thus, to create a subdirectory
       named MAIL directly under your own UFD,  simply  type
       "[,,MAIL]".   CREDIR  will  then prompt for the name;
       usually you will want to ignore this, so respond with
       a carriage return.  If you want to specify a mnemonic
       name,  give  it  (inside  double  quotes  if  special
       characters  are  included).   CREDIR will then prompt
       for  the  protection;    simply   answer   with   the
       protection  in octal.  CREDIR will type out the name,
       unit, and protection of each directory.  If  you  are
       under  [1,2]  and  specify  a  UFD,  you will also be
       prompted  for  logged  in  and  logged  out   quotas.
       Respond  with  a decimal number (if in thousands, you
       can say 10K for 10000, etc.).  If  you  give  a  null
       response  to  the  quotas,  the  quota will be set to
       infinity.  You can  terminate  the  loop  asking  for
       directories with either ^C or ^Z.

       To use CREDIR in switch mode, respond to the original
       prompt with a directory and optionally a device.  You
       can specify the name with the switch /NAME:  followed
       by  the name as a quoted string.  You can specify the
       protection with the switch /PROTECTION:  followed  by
       the  protection  in octal.  If you are creating a UFD
       from [1,2],  you  can  also  specify  quotas  by  the
       switches  /IN:   and  /OUT:   followed  by  a decimal
       number (again, the suffix K means thousand).   CREDIR
       will  respond  with  the  name of the directory being
       created, the unit, and the protection.  It will  then
       re-prompt  for  another  directory.  To exit from the
       loop, type ^C or ^Z.

       To use CREDIR in ersatz device mode, respond  to  the
       original  question with the name of the ersatz device
       you  wish  to  create.   Don't  bother  specifying  a
       directory since CREDIR will ignore it anyway.  CREDIR
       will respond with the names of the structures,  etc.,
       units,  and  protection  used  for the ersatz device.
CREDIR.DOC -- changes from version 1 to 2             Page 4


       The default name will  be  the  same  as  the  ersatz
       device.   The  default protection will be the same as
       that for SYS:, and the default quotas  are  infinity.
       You  can  override  the  defaults  by  specifying the
       switches /NAME, /PROTECTION, /IN, and /OUT.
