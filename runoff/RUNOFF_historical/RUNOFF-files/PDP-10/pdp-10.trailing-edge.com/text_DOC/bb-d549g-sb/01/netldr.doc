NETLDR.DOC -- Changes from V2A(110) to V3(135)
August 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

NETLDR is the DEC-10 side  bootstrap  program  that  dumps  and  loads
network remote stations such as the DN82.  For NETLDR to run properly,
there must be a bootstrap program running in the station being loaded.
In  the  case  of  the  DN82,  either  the  BM873 or M9301 ROM must be
running.  The DN82 generally jumps to the ROM when  it  crashes  which
allows it to reload itself without operator intervention.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

NETLDR now logs all reloads via the DAEMON UUO.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Refer to NET2A.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Code to log reloads via the DAEMON UUO was added.

NETLDR.DOC -- Changes from V2(77) to V2A(110)
April 1977



1.0 SUMMARY

NETLDR is the DEC-10 side  bootstrap  program  that  dumps  and  loads
network  remote stations such as the DN82 and DC72.  For NETLDR to run
properly, there must be a bootstrap program  running  in  the  station
being loaded.  In the case of the DC72, this bootstrap is read in from
a deck of cards by the remote station operator;  in the  case  of  the
DN82,  either  the  BM873  or  M9301  ROM  must  be running.  The DN82
generally jumps to the ROM when it crashes which allows it  to  reload
itself without operator intervention.



2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

NETLDR will accept load requests containing a dump file  specification
only if it is for a file on XPN:.

NETLDR now supports remote station types DAS92 and DAS98.

There are several minor bug fixes.



3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICENCIES

NETLDR.INI files that contain blank lines are not properly handled.



4.0 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These files should be available:

     1.  SYS:NETLDR.EXE
     2.  SYS:NETLDR.INI
     3.  HLP:NETLDR.HLP

NETLDR.INI  is  not  distributed  as   it   contains   site   specific
information.   See NET2.DOC (appended to this document) for details on
its contents.  It is required  to  take  advantage  of  the  automatic
reload feature.

The automatic reload feature can be disabled by typing:

     .SET SCHED 1000

5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES

A ".REQUIRE REL:HELPER" statement has been included in the  source  to
simplify loading.  See the title page for more information.



6.0 SUGGESTIONS

None pending.

NETLDR.DOC -- Changes from V1 to V2(77)
September 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of the release of NETLDR version 2 is to support the  6.02
and  6.02A monitors.  NETLDR is the DECsystem-10 CUSP which is used to
downline load DC72NP, DN80, DN81, and DN82 remote station code.


2.0  RUNNING NETLDR

NETLDR  may  be  run  either  automatically  or  explicitly   by   the
DECsystem-10 operator.


2.1  Automatic Execution of NETLDR

A network node which wishes to be loaded will send  a  "request  load"
message  over  its  synchronous  line.   The  node  which receives the
request will transmit the message to the  DECsystem-10  as  a  station
control  message.   The  monitor will automatically run NETLDR when it
receives such a request.

A request may include sufficient information for NETLDR  to  dump  and
load  as  requested.   If  insufficient  information is present in the
request, NETLDR will search SYS:NETLDR.INI for a  line  which  matches
the  request.   Lines  in NETLDR.INI contain two parts separated by an
equal sign.  The left half of each line is of the form:

          /NODE:name/LINE:#/TYPE:type/SERIAL:#

Name is the name or number of the node adjacent  to  the  node  to  be
booted.   Line # is the synchronous line # on the adjacent node.  Type
is the type of node the bootstrap is running in, either DC71, DC72, or
DN82.   The serial # is the serial number supplied by the bootstrap in
the node to be booted.  Whatever is on the left  of  the  equals  sign
MUST MATCH EXACTLY with the information supplied with the request load
message.

The right half of each line must be in the form of:

          =CMD(1),CMD(2),.  .  .,CMD(N)

Where CMD is a filespec and/or switches as described in  Section  2.2.
The default device is SYS for loading and XPN for dumping.

Example:

          /NODE:ZOT/LINE:1/TYPE:DN82/SERIAL:7=/D,DN82 !COMMENT

This dumps the node connected to line  1  of  node  ZOT  onto  XPN  as
ZOT.LSD and then loads the node with SYS:DN82.BIN.
NET2.DOC                                                        Page 6


Switches /NODE, /LINE, and /PDP8 or /PDP11 need not  be  specified  on
the right of the equals sign in NETLDR.INI as the request load message
supplies this information to NETLDR.


2.2  Operator use of NETLDR.

The NETLDR program performs system operations on  remote  nodes.   The
type  of  remote  node  and the desired operations are specified using
switches in the file specification.

NETLDR can be used to clear, dump  and  load  a  remote  node  and  to
execute software on remote nodes.

Command Format

     .R NETLDR

     The program then issues the prompt:

          FILE:

     The user must then enter a command string of the form:

          filespec/m-switch/n-switch/ch-switch/opt-switch/opt-switch

where:

     filespec is of the form:

          dev:filename.ext[proj,prog]

     The filespec argument is optional.  If ext is omitted for a LOAD,
     the  default extension is .BIN.  If the filespec is omitted for a
     DUMP, the file written is NODENAME.LSD on the user's disk area.

     m-switch is a required switch specifying that the remote node  is
     either a PDP-8 or PDP-11.  For example:

          /PDP8 or /8

          /PDP11 or /11

     n-switch is a required switch identifying the remote node.   This
     switch may take one of the following forms:

     /NODE: node-num          specifying the number of the remote node

     /NODE: node-name         specifying the name of the remote node

ch-switch is a required switch specifying the number of  the  line  to
which  the  node  to  be  used is attached.  The /SELF argument may be
entered if the remote node specified by the  /NODE  switch  is  to  be
used.
NET2.DOC                                                        Page 7


     /LINE: line-num          specifying the hardware line  number  in
                              the   range   0   through   17  (octal).
                              Line-num identifies the  node  that  the
                              operation  is for by specifying the line
                              number connecting to it from the  remote
                              node.

     /SELF                    specifying that the operation is for the
                              node itself.

     opt-switch is one of the following:

     /CLEAR                   clears the memory of the remote node.

                              Default 0 - 17777 for a PDP8.

                              Default 0 - 77776 for a PDP11.

     /CLEAR: x-y              clears   memory   location   x   through
                              location y inclusive.

     /CLEAR: x-*              clears memory location x  through  17777
                              for a PDP-8;  77776 for a PDP-11.

     /DUMP                    creates an  octal  dump  of  the  remote
                              node's  memory  into  the specified file
                              (0-17777 for a  PDP-8;   0-77776  for  a
                              PDP-11).   If  no  file is specified the
                              default   is   nodename.LSD.    If   the
                              filename   has  question  marks  in  it,
                              numbers  will  be   supplied   for   the
                              question  marks  starting  with 0 if the
                              index file has not been created, or with
                              the  filename in the index file +1 if it
                              has  been  created.   The   index   file
                              contains  the  name  of  the  last  file
                              dumped and has the filename given by the
                              user in the dump command.

     /DUMP: x-y               dumps  memory  locations  x  through   y
                              inclusive.

     /DUMP: x-*               dumps  memory  location  x  through  the
                              machine's   upper  limit  (17777  for  a
                              PDP-8;  77776 for a PDP-11).

     /HELP                    prints a list of the switches available.

     /HPQ:x                   RUN NETLDR in HPQ x.

     /IMAGE                   the file to be read is in image mode.

     /LOAD                    load the file  into  the  remote  node's
                              memory, but do not start the program.
NET2.DOC                                                        Page 8


     /PACKED                  The file is  a  binary  file  in  MACDLX
                              format.

     /START:address           load the file  into  the  remote  node's
                              memory  and  start  it  at the specified
                              address.  If the filespec is omitted and
                              the  /START:x  switch  is in the command
                              string, the node is started  at  address
                              x.

DEFAULTS:

     1.  Specifying PTR as the device implies image mode.

     2.  The default upper memory location for a PDP-8 is 17777.

     3.  The default upper memory location for a PDP-11 is 77776.

     4.  The default extension for a LOAD is .BIN.

     5.  The default DUMP file is NODENAME.LSD.

     6.  The default device for /DUMP and /LOAD is DSK.

     7.  The default load format is /IMAGE for a PDP-8.

     8.  The default load format is /PACKED for a PDP-11.

EXAMPLES:

FILE:  DSKN:NYC[14,16]/NODE:BOSTON/LINE:0/PDP11/START:1000

          Load the file NYC.BIN from DSKN area  [14,16]  on  the  host
          node  into  the  node connected to line 0 of node BOSTON and
          start the program at address 1000.

FILE:  /DUMP/NODE:BOSTON/SELF/PDP11

          Dump locations 0-77776 of node BOSTON onto  DSK  as  a  file
          named BOSTON.LSD.

FILE:  /CLEAR:10-74/PDP11/NODE:2/LINE:1

          Clear locations 10 through 74 of the node connected to  line
          1 of node number 2.
