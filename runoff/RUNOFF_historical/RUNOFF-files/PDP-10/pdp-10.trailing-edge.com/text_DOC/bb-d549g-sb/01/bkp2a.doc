BACKUP.DOC -- Changes from V2 to V2A(313)
July 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a maintenance release of BACKUP, a  program  for  transferring
files between disk and magnetic tape.

Version 2A of BACKUP must be loaded with SCAN Version 7B, WILD Version
7A, and field image versions of HELPER and ENDECR.  BACKUP runs on all
supported monitors and has been tested under 603 monitors.


Documentation  for  using  BACKUP  is  contained  in  the  help   file
BACKUP.HLP,   and  in  the  specifications  section  of  the  software
notebooks.  A program logic manual for BACKUP and it's  worker  module
BACKRS  can be produced by submitting the source files (BACKUP.MAC and
BACKRS.MAC) to RUNOFF Version 10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There is only one external change from Version 2:   the  default  file
specifications  that  are  used  when files are restored from magnetic
tape to disk.  All defaults are defined in the help file.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiencies are known to exist in Version 2A:

Full .SCWLD style of pattern replacements are not yet implemented.

"'NOT'", etc., in full .LKWLD implementation is not operational.

When a saved tape file containing  repeater  records  is  restored  to
disk,  valid records can be lost causing an incomplete disk file to be
written.  A patch to correct this failure is contained in  the  Beware
file  BKP2A.BWR.   it  is  strongly  recommended  that  this  edit  be
installed at every site before Version 2A is installed.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Files involved:

BACKUP.MAC, BACKRS.MAC -- source files which make up this product.

BACKUP.EXE -- the executable files.

BACKUP.RNH -- input to RUNOFF V.10 to make the help file.

BACKUP.HLP -- the help file.

BACKUP.PLM, BACKRS.PLM -- program logic manuals extracted from the the
source files by RUNOFF V.10.

To build the program you must use MACRO V.52:

     .SSAVE BACKUP

This assumes MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV and SCNMAC.UNV are on device  UNV:

BACKUP.DOC -- Changes from V1 to V2(216)
October 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This is the first field release of BACKUP, a program  for  transfering
files  between  disk  and  magnetic  tape.   This version of BACKUP is
intended to replace FAILSAFE  as  the  system  program  for  providing
backup storage of the disk file stucture system on magnetic tape.

Version 2 of BACKUP must be loaded with SCAN version 7B, WILD  version
7A, and field image versions of HELPER and ENDECR.  BACKUP runs on all
supported monitors, and has been tested under 602 monitors.


Documentation  for  using  BACKUP  is  contained  in  the  help   file
BACKUP.HLP,   and  in  the  specifications  section  of  the  software
notebooks.  A program logic manual for BACKUP and it's  worker  module
BACKRS  can be produced by submitting the source files (BACKUP.MAC and
BACKRS.MAC) to RUNOFF version 10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Version 1 of BACKUP ran only interchange mode, a mode in which  system
dependent  overhead  information  was not included on tape.  Version 2
has been expanded to  support  running  in  non-interchange  mode  and
including  all  system  information  on  tape.   This  mode is now the
default and running in interchange mode  is  enabled  by  means  of  a
switch.  All switches listed in the documentation are now supported.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiences are known to exist in version 2:

Full .SCWLD style of pattern replacements  are  not  yet  implemented.
Waiting for DEC command standard.

"'NOT'", etc., in full .LKWLD implementation is not yet implemented.

LABEL command and writing labels are not yet implemented.

BACKUP.DOC -- V1
April 1975



1.0  summary

This is the first release of BACKUP, a program for  transfering  files
between  systems  via  mag  tape.   Version 1 of BACKUP is designed to
facilitate  interchange  of  files  between  sites,   and   soon   all
DECsystem-10 software will be distributed in BACKUP format.  Version 1
of BACKUP supports interchange mode only.  In this  mode  BACKUP  does
not  write  system  specific information on tape, but only information
which is critical to the file itself.  On a restore,  system  defaults
are applied.  Version 1 is NOT intended as a replacement for FAILSAFE.
We strongly recommend against attempting to use it for  this  purpose.
(A future version of BACKUP will be generalized to support other modes
and will be suitable for performing system backup.)

Version 1 is being distributed to allow sites to become familiar  with
the  program which will become the principle tool for all DECsystem-10
software distributions.  A phased switch-over to  Backup  is  planned.
First,   a  parallel  distribution  (using  BACKUP  and  FAILSAFE)  of
unbundled software to selected test sites will be tried.  Next a  full
software  distribution  in parallel to all sites will be accomplished.
If problems are discovered and corrected during these  tests,  version
1A  of BACKUP will be created and distributed.  Finally, on successful
completion of these distributions,  regular  use  of  BACKUP  for  all
release  distributions will begin and FAILSAFE format releases will no
longer be available.

Version 1 of BACKUP is classed as support category C.   Please  report
reactions,  suggestions and problems with BACKUP via SPRs.  We solicit
your input, and it will be forwarded directly to BACKUP's  developers.
However,  no  SPRs  will  be  answered  and  no correspondence will be
entered into.  This early distribution of BACKUP has been done to give
your  installation  a chance to gain experience with this new program.
You may view it as an opportunity to participate in  field-testing  an
important new product.

This version of BACKUP must be loaded with SCAN version 7A, and  field
image  versions  of  HELPER  and ENDECR.  BACKUP runs on all supported
monitors.

Documentation  for  using  BACKUP  is  contained  in  the  help   file
BACKUP.HLP.   A program logic manual for BACKUP and it's worker module
BACKRS can be produced by submitting the source files (BACKUP.MAC  and
BACKRS.MAC) to RUNOFF version 10.

1.1  Disclaimers

     1.  Version 1 of BACKUP does not replace failsafe.

     2.  Not all features are implemented or tested.  Expect  problems
         if you experiment with untested features.

     3.  BACKUP is support category  C.   Do  not  ask  your  software
         specialist  for  help.   SPRs  will  be  acknowledged but not
         answered.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiences are known to exist in version 1:

Only interchange mode is supported.

Write recovery code to rewrite on tape errors doesn't work.

On read, the last occurance of a repeated block should be used instead
of the first.

Switches /NOSTRS and /OKPROTECTION are not supported.

Full .SCWLD style of pattern replacements are not yet implemented.

Unused INTERNs between routines should be cleaned out.

"'NOT'", etc., in full .LKWLD implementation is not yet supported.

Human interface on reel switching is poorly designed.

LABEL command and writing labels are not yet implemented.

T$CON record on new reel has not been implemented.  This is needed  to
ensure that new reel playback does not require previous reel.

Files cannot be non-contiguous on playback.  Allow this and omit  tape
blocks on write which are totally zero.

Fully general disk devices are not yet implemented.

There are duplicated internal routines, which should be fixed by force
loading parts of SCAN into the low segment.
