BOOTM.DOC -- Changes from V4(17) to V5(30)
June 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

In addition to some maintenance edits, this version of BOOTM  includes
support  for  TU45 tape drives on a TM02/TM03 controller and TU7x tape
drives on a DX20 controller.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

A new switch, /DX20 has been added to tell BOOTM that the  tape  drive
is a TU7x on a DX20.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to BOOTM.RNO information on generating tapes  for  use  by
BOOTM are contained in;

     1.  GETMON - Getting a monitor from DISK or MAGTAPE.

     2.  MIG701 - Monitor Installation Guide for 7.01



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

20     Add TM02/RH11 support for KS10

21     Allow for TM03s on RH11s

22     Make sure all microprocessor communication  words  are  cleared
       out

23     Add support for TU7xs on a DX20

24     Fix core sizing problem on KS10s

25     If LINK writes an EXE file that does not fill up the last page,
       BOOTM will give BTMBFI - BACKUP file inconsistant error because
       in an attempt to read 512 words from the last record (which may

       really contain less) it reads the next block.

26     Make mask for APRID 1 bit narrower so that BOOTM doesn't  think
       that it's running on a KS if if it's run on a KL with MOS.

27     Inhibit accounting meter updates into the old UPT when changing
       the UBR to avoid hanging the microcode.

30     Make sure the NXM flag is clear in the CONI  before  trying  to
       find the top of memory with a NXM scan.

controller.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     2.  MIG603 - Monitor Installation Guide for 6.03.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

BOOTM will now support  TM03  controllers.   A  problem  with  a  TC10

BOOTM.DOC -- Changes from V3(15) to V4(16)
March 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOTM is a bootstrap program which is used for loading the timesharing
monitor  from  a  magnetic  tape  written in either FAILSAFE or BACKUP
format.

The major change from version 3(15) to 4(16) is to allow BOOTM to  run
on a 128 model B KL10 processor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to BOOTM.RNO, information on generating tapes for  use  by
BOOTM are contained in:

     1.  GETMON - Getting a monitor from DISK or MAGTAPE.

     2.  MIG603 - Monitor Installation Guide for 6.03.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

BOOTM will now handle a trap caused by a non-ex mem.  The  TU70-driver
portion of BOOTM now turns on automatic error recovery in the DX10, so
that if version 4 of the micro-code is running in the DX a better kind
of error recovery is followed.

The start address of BOOTM has been changed to be 5000 (from 4000) due
to the increased size of the new DXLD program.

BOOTM.DOC -- Changes from V2(14) to V3(15)
October 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOTM is a bootstrap program which is used for loading the timesharing
monitor from a magnetic-tape written in FAILSA or BACKUP format.

BOOTM  completely  supercedes  MAGRIM  as  the  primary   method   for
bootstraping from mag-tape.

BOOTM supports all  currently  supported  mag-tape  hardware  such  as
TM10A/B, TX01, TM02, and TC01C tape controller.



2.0  EXTERNAL changes

BOOTM V3(15) now supports TM02 tape controllers (TU16 or TU45) on both
RH10's and RH20's.



3.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

1 feature test switch, FTRH20, has been added.  If this switch  is  on
(defaults  to  on)  BOOTM  will  read from a TM02 on either an RH10 or
RH20.  If off only RH10's will be read.



4.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



5.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to BOOTM.RNO, information on generating tapes for  use  by
BOOTM are contained in:
