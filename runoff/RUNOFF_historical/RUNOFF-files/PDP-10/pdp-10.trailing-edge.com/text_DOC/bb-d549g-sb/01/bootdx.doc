BOOTDX.DOC -- Changes from V2(15) to V3(21)
August 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOTDX is a bootstrap program which is used for loading  the  DX10  or
DX20  micro-code  from  the  DSK:.   BOOTDX  runs in user-mode under a
DECsystem-10 timesharing system.  It requires 8P of memory but expands
for I/O buffers.  BOOTDX does I/O instructions directly to the DX10 or
DX20 hardware.  For this to work, the BOOTDX job must have  privileges
for the TRPSET function of the timesharing system.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Some new switches have been added for the DX20 - see BOOTDX.HLP.   The
/DX10  and /DX20 switches have been added to determine whether to load
a DX10 or DX20.  the default is /DX10.

     /CPU:P    Select CPU on which device exists
     /DX10     Device is a DX10
     /DX20:K   Device is a DX20 with controller k.
     /TYPE:T   Look for DX20 device-type T 
               (Low-order bits of RH20 register 6)



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS

Put BOOTDX on SYS:, if you  have  a  DX20,  put  DXMCA.ADX  (the  DX20
microcode) on SYS:.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.

for  I/O  buffers.   BOOTDX does I/O instructions directly to the DX10
hardware.  For this to work, the BOOTDX job must have  privileges  for
the TRPSET function of the timesharing system.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

BOOTDX has been changed to read either .BIN files or  .A8  files.   It
also does an automatic clear before loading.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None outstanding.
