CRSCPY.DOC -- Program to copy crashes dumped by the monitor, V1(24)
June 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

The 7.01 monitor includes a fast monitor resident  bootstrap  (MONBTS)
which  has  the  capability  of  very fast dump/reload and continuable
STOPCD dump.   In  addition,  the  monitor  provides  a  mechanism  to
automatically  start  up  a  program  which will copy the dump(s) just
taken.  CRSCPY is an example of a program which can be run to do this.
CRSCPY,  as  described  in this .DOC and the associated .MEM file is a
prototype that you may use to help you in  understanding  the  monitor
interface  and  the  tasks  that  must be performed by such a program.
CRSCPY is being supplied to serve as a basis for the program  you  may
wish  to  write  to  tailor  the  copy procedure to your installation.
Every installation will have varying needs and procedures with  regard
to   crash   copying,  and  may  indeed  already  have  some  form  of
semi-automatic procedure  to  copy  crashes.   Therefore,  it  is  not
expected that CRSCPY will be used without change by each installation.
The Digital-supplied prototype supports automatic copy of crashes when
invoked  by  the  monitor,  manual  copy  of  crashes  when  run by an
operator, and a log and report feature of the crashes that it  copied.
See  CRSCPY.MEM and CRSCPY.HLP for more detailed information about the
operation of the program and the interface with the monitor.

CRSCPY has been tested on KI, KL, and KS  processors  under  the  7.01
version of the monitor.  It will work correctly under earlier versions
of  the  monitor  when  run  by  an  operator  but  will  not  be  run
automatically to copy dumps.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES
CRSCPY.DOC                                                      Page 3


Edit #

1      If the date/time of the dump is zero, print Unknown instead  of
       junk.

2      If the STOPCD  name  extracted  from  the  dump  is  not  three
       alphanumeric  characters,  use  SER.   This  keeps  the  output
       filename from being junk.

3      Add the CBEGIN and CEND commands to allow the user to  restrict
       the report to crashes copied (as opposed to dumped) between the
       specified times.

4      Add a block to each entry containing  the  disposition  of  the
       crash.    add  the  disposition  command  to  allow  a  systems
       programmer to give a disposition for a crash.  This edit starts
       file version 2 of CRASH.SYS.

5      Allow the report restriction  switches  to  be  placed  on  the
       report command line in addition to being typed as commands.

6      Change the syntax of the /STRUCTURE command to allow the system
       administrator  to  specify one or more sets of structures to be
       load balanced across.  Also allow the minimum acceptable number
       of  blocks  remaining  on  a structure to be specified for each
       structure.

7      Change the report format to print the uptime immediately  after
       the crash date/time instead of after the copy date/time.

10     Add the /PRIMETIME switch  to  restrict  the  report  to  those
       crashes which occured during prime time (0800-1700).

11     Add the PURGE FILE command which will delete SYS:CRASH.SYS  but
       maintain  the header so that the sequence numbers will continue
       from the current value.

12     Add the /UNDISPOSED switch to  only  report  on  those  crashes
       which have not been disposed.

13     Fix an off-by-one bug in /UNDISPOSED processing which caused to
       to flag some disposed crashes as undisposed.

14     Read the .EXE directory of the crash being copied and only copy
       the  number  of  blocks  specified.  This saves disk space when
       copying crashes dumped onto CRASH.EXE's which are  bigger  that
       the amount of memory actually dumped.

15     Add the [NO]DELETE command to allow  the  user  to  delete  the
       crash file when it is disposed.

16     Check for -1 in word 30 of the crash and call the  output  file
       SERnnn if it is.

17     If the symbol DFTPPN is set to a  PPN,  don't  clear  JACCT  if
CRSCPY.DOC                                                      Page 4


       FILDAE  is  not  running  and CRSCPY is running under that PPN.
       This is for field test sites which do not run  FILDAE  so  that
       DEC can update CRASH.SYS.

20     Edit 17 wasn't  sufficient  for  the  REPORT  command.   Add  a
       missing FO.PRV in OPNSYB.

21     Add  the  /[NO]HEADER  switch/command  to  enable/disable   the
       printing of the headers on the REPORT command.  The headers are
       a lose on a slow terminal.  Default is still /HEADER.

22     Change the /SEQUENCE  switch  to  allow  a  range  of  sequence
       numbers.  The new syntax is /SEQUENCE:m:n.

23     Change the syntax of the  DISPOSITION  command  to  allow  more
       flexibility  in the disposition of crashes.  The new syntax is:
       DISPOSITION filespec/switches, where  filespec  is  a  filespec
       that  appears  in  CRASH.SYS and switches are the switches that
       can be specified on the REPORT command.  this  means  that  the
       old syntax of DISPOSITION nn is now DISPOSITION/SEQUENCE:nn.

24     Memorize switches read from SWITCH.INI as sticky  defaults  for
       typed commands.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
