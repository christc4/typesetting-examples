CONFIG.DOC -- V1(6)
April 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

CONFIG, in conjunction with the 7.01 monitor, is a program which  aids
in  the  logical  and  physical  reconfiguration of hardware in an SMP
system.  In particular, it allows devices,  CPUs,  and  memory  to  be
ADDed  to  or  be  REMOVEed  from  a  system  to facillitate PM and CM
functions without disturbing system operation.

CONFIG has been tested on KI and KL processors under the 7.01  version
of the monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit 2   Correct a bug which allowed the removal of the  last  running
CPU.

Edit 3   Begin implementing support for  System  Sleep.   The  command
that  invokes  System  Sleep  is  not  yet available since the Monitor
support is not finished.

Edit 4   If the operator forces the removal of a CPU, don't attempt to
DETACH the disk units.

Edit 5   The Monitor variable KONCPU has moved in load 70037.

Edit 6   DETACH the CPU after REMOVE has completed.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install CONFIG.EXE on SYS.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Not applicable.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS
