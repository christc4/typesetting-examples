FILDAE.DOC -- Changes from V1(16) to V2(22)
February 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of this release of the File  Daemon  is  to  fix  serveral
minor  bugs  and  to  support  full file specifications on the PROGRAM
switch  (including  SFDs).   This   feature   is   only   useful   for
installations running a 7-series monitor.

This version of the File Daemon has been tested under 603,  603A,  and
the 7-series monitor and fully supersedes all previous versions.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The PROGRAM switch in ACCESS.USR may now have as an  argument  a  full
file  specification.   That  is,  if  the monitor supports SFDs in the
GET/RUN commands, and RUN UUOs, the switch may have the following form

/PROGRAM:STR:FILE.EXT[P,Pn,SFD1,SFD2,...SFDn]

The File Daemon will only consider the program accessing the  file  to
be  the  same  as  the program specified in the /PROGRAM switch if the
full file specification matches the argument to the /PROGRAM switch.



3.0  Known bugs and deficiencies

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install the File Daemon (FILDAE) on  SYS  and  include  the  following
sequence of instructions in the OPSER AUTO file (OPR.ATO):


          :SLOG 1/2
          .R FILDAE


The File Daemon DETACHes itself and runs  unattended;   therefore,  it
does not monopolize an OPSER PTY.
FLD2.DOC                                                        Page 3


If the File Daemon crashes for any reason, the operator should  ATTACH
to the File Daemon job and type the following:


          .R FILDAE


The operator should not log in another job and run the File Daemon, as
this action will not work.

To rebuild FILDAE.EXE from FILDAE.MAC follow  the  FILDAE  section  in
BUILD.CTL.   Be  sure to use SCNMAC 7(106) (or later) as supplied with
this tape.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

       Fix minor bugs

              1) Use GOBSTR rather than SYSSTR to read SYS search list
              2) Reduce core to original .JBFF after scanning a line from
                 ACCESS.USR
              3) Handle the case of a page in the IPCF receive queue
20

       Support SFDs on RUN and GET commands (requires 7-series monitor)

21
       Cause "in your behalf" FILOP. to fail if there is no ACCESS.USR

22
       Don't ignore ACCESS.USR if the  author is the owner of the file
       structure where it was found.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

It has been suggested that a NAME switch be implemented which could be
specified in conjunction with a [P,Pn] in the access list and that the
name specified as the argument to the switch be  matched  against  the
logged  in  name  of  the  user attempting access to the file.  If the
names did not match, the  entry  in  the  access  list  would  not  be
considered  a match even though the [P,Pn]s were identical.  Also, see
FLD1.DOC for other suggestions.

FILDAE.DOC -- V1(16)
February 1977



1.0    SUMMARY

The support for a File Daemon,  in  the  6.03  Monitor,  provides  for
extended file protection.  The File Daemon described in this .DOC file
is a prototype that you may use  to  help  you  in  understanding  the
monitor  support  for this feature.  The File Daemon is being supplied
to serve as a prototype for the File Daemon you  may  desire  at  your
installation.  Installations will have varying types of accounting and
file  security  measures  at  these  installations.   Therefore,  each
installation's  File  Daemon  may  be  written  to  account  for these
differences and requirements.   The  DIGITAL-supplied  prototype  File
Daemon  supports access lists and access logging which is performed on
a user's or a system administrator's request.


1.1    BIBIOGRAPHY

603.MCO lists the monitor changes made to support a File  Daemon.   In
particular,  refer  to  MCO  number 6370 for a description of when the
monitor passes control to the File Daemon.



2.0    EXTERNAL CHANGES (USER INTERFACE)

The File Daemon allows any user to specify who can (and cannot) access
their  files.  Each user may create a file called ACCESS.USR (which is
described in section 2.2).  This file optionally lists  the  names  of
some  or all of that user's files and specifies, on an individual file
basis, the users  who  can  and  cannot  access  those  files.   Under
specific  conditions,  the  File Daemon examines the user's ACCESS.USR
file and may record information regarding specific access requests  to
the listed files in a separate file called ACCESS.LOG.


2.1    The File Daemon

The monitor calls the File Daemon (only if the  monitor  feature  test
switch  FTFDAE = - 1)  each  time  that someone tries to access a file
that has a 4, 5, 6, or 7 protection code  in  the  owner's  protection
code  field  and  the access fails due to a protection error or due to
any protection error because of the directory  protection  code.   For
example,  if  you protect a file against a specific user and that user
attempts access to  your  file  (e.g.,  LOOKUP,  ENTER,  RENAME),  the
monitor  suspends  the  execution of the user's program and it sends a
message to the File Daemon.  This message includes the type of  access
the user is attempting and that user's project-programmer number.  The
File Daemon is given control,  and  it  looks  for  your  file  called
ACCESS.USR (which must be on the same file structure as the file being
accessed and which should be in the same directory area  as  the  file
FLD1.DOC                                                        Page 5


being  accessed).  After examining ACCESS.USR, the File Daemon returns
to the monitor the highest type of access you have specified that this
user  can  have  to  your  file  and  it  logs  the  access request in
ACCESS.LOG (if you set the /LOG switch in your  ACCESS.USR).   All  of
this  occurs  even  when  you attempt to access your own file, if that
file has a 4, 5, 6, or 7 protection code  in  the  owner's  protection
code  field.  However, as the file's owner, you can read your file and
change its protection code without  having  the  File  Daemon  called.
Depending  on  the  information  you specified in your ACCESS.USR, the
File Daemon either grants or denies access to the accessing user.

If the monitor attempts to pass control to the File Daemon, but it  is
not  running,  the  accessing user is denied access to the file unless
the program has full file access rights ([1,2] or  JACCT).   The  same
result occurs when one of the following conditions occurs:

     1.  The File Daemon cannot find ACCESS.USR in the  same  path  as
         the file to-be-accessed.

     2.  The File Daemon cannot  find  ACCESS.USR  in  a  higher-level
         directory, when a scan up the directory structure is made.


If the File Daemon finds ACCESS.USR but cannot find the accessed  file
name  in  ACCESS.USR,  the File Daemon denies that user access to your
file.  Access is also denied to that user if the file name is found in
ACCESS.USR but the accessing user's project-programmer number does not
match any of the project-programmer numbers you  have  specified  that
may have access to your file.


All files listed in your ACCESS.USR are assumed to be in the same  UFD
as  the  file  ACCESS.USR.  However, if your ACCESS.USR is in your UFD
and describes the type of access to be allowed to files  contained  in
SFDs the full path to the file in the SFD must be specified before the
File Daemon will consider the file specifications to match.  The  File
Daemon  treats  all  file  accessors the same.  All accesses to a file
having a 4, 5, 6, or 7 protection code in the owner's protection  code
field  cause  the  File  Daemon  to  be called when a protection error
occurs.  The File Daemon is always  called  when  a  protection  error
occurs  as a result of the directory protection code.  Because of this
equal treatment, you should note the following:


     1.  If a [1,2] job attempts to access a file  that  is  protected
         such  that  the File Daemon is called, that job may be denied
         access to the file.  This is a possible problem, for example,
         if  the  [1,2]  job  is  FAILSA or BACKUP and you have denied
         (either implicitly or explicity)  these  programs  access  to
         your  files.   When  you  do  this,  your  file  will  not be
         failsafed.  Therefore, you must accept the responsibility for
         failsafing your own files.
FLD1.DOC                                                        Page 6


     2.  In general, full file access programs will not be allowed  to
         read  your  files.  Therefore, under most circumstance, QUEUE
         would not be allowed to queue a file that was protected  such
         that the File Daemon was called.

     3.  If the file's owner protection code field is  such  that  the
         the  File  Daemon  is  called  and the owner has neglected to
         include his own project-programmer number in  ACCESS.USR  for
         this  file, the File Daemon grants the owner the same type of
         access as if a 7 were in the owner's  protection  code  field
         (the  owner  can  only  read  or change the protection of the
         file).

     4.  ACCESS.USR  files  may  be  restored  at   arbitrary   times.
         Therefore,  a full restore of the disk using BACKUP or FAILSA
         should not be done when the File Daemon is running.  If  such
         a   full   restore   is   done,  the  action  may  not  allow
         BACKUP/FAILSA to restore files that ACCESS.USR allows them to
         backup.

     5.  The CHKACC UUO will tell a program what a users  file  access
         privileges  are.  Thus by using CHKACC, a program can tell if
         the File Daemon will be called,  but  the  access  privileges
         returned by the File Daemon are not known.


2.2  ACCESS.USR

Every user can create their own ACCESS.USR file.  ACCESS.USR  is  made
up  of  one  or  more  'command  lines'.   Each 'command line' must be
written in the following format:

          file-spec/switches=[ppn]/switches,...,[ppn]/switches

The  file-spec  is  a   full   file   specification   (i.e.,   device:
filename.extension[path].    The   File  Daemon  scans  each  line  of
ACCESS.USR until it matches a file-spec on the left of the equal  sign
and  a ppn on the right.  All access rights will then be determined by
that line  (there  will  be  no  continued  scan).   The  user  should
minimally specify one of the switches synonymous with protection codes
(READ,EXECUTE,ALL,..) for that file-spec.  If no switch is  specified,
a  default  of  /NONE  is  provided.  The possible switches are listed
below:


Switch                        Meaning


/LOG - /NOLOG

         This switch causes the File Daemon to log any access  attempt
         in  the  file ACCESS.LOG.  If this switch is specified, a LOG
         entry is appended to the end of ACCESS.LOG, which is found in
         the  same  directory  as  your  ACCESS.USR.   The  log  entry
         includes the following:
FLD1.DOC                                                        Page 7


             the date of the access
             the time of the access
             the job number of the accessing job
             the project-programmer number and name
                  associated with the accessing job
             the name of the accessing program
             the type of access attempted
             the full file specification of the accessed file
             the access permitted, detailing whether access was
                   permitted to the file

         If the /EXIT or  /CLOSE  switch  (described  below)  is  also
         specified,  the following information is also included in the
         LOG entry:  (both in the initial entry  and  again  when  the
         file is closed)

             the accessing job's run time
             kilo-core-seconds
             disk reads
             disk writes

         If the File Daemon cannot find ACCESS.LOG in  your  area,  it
         creates  one,  giving  it  the  same  protection code as your
         ACCESS.USR.  Note that the  File  Daemon  can  always  access
         ACCESS.USR and ACCESS.LOG.


/LOG:SWITCH value

         This switch allows conditional logging based  on  the  switch
         value.  the following are legal switch values:

         ALL - log all accesses attempted (same as /LOG).

         NONE - do not log accesses (same as /NOLOG).

         SUCCESSES - log only those accesses which  were  permited  to
         succeed.

         FAILURES - log only those accesses which were not permited.


/CLOSE - /NOCLOSE

         If the /LOG switch and the /CLOSE switch are  specified,  the
         File  Daemon  makes the log entry in ACCESS.LOG when the file
         is closed.


/EXIT - /NOEXIT

         If a program is executing and the  /LOG  and  /EXIT  switches
         have been specified, the File Daemon makes the log entry when
         the program has finished execution.
FLD1.DOC                                                        Page 8


/CREATE - /NOCREATE

         The /CREATE switch allows a user who would ordinarily not  be
         allowed  to  create  files  in your directory to do so.  This
         switch is used in conjunction  with  one  of  the  ACCESS.USR
         switches  that  are  synonomous  with protection codes (e.g.,
         /RENAME).  This switch can appear on either side of the equal
         sign.   An  example of a command line with the /CREATE switch
         is

         WONDER.TST/CREATE/NONE=[*,*]

         which allows any user to create WONDER.TST in your directory,
         but  none  of  those  users may have any other access to that
         file.  Another example is

         WONDER.TST=[10,3333]/CREATE/READ[*,*]/NONE

         which prevents all users from accessing the file  WONDER.TST,
         but allows user [10,3333] to create the file WONDER.TST.


/PROTECTION:nnn

         This switch specifies the protection code with which  a  file
         will  be  created.   This  switch is allowed only on the left
         side of the equal sign.  The  value  nnn  must  be  an  octal
         number  in  the  range  0-777.   The file is created with the
         specified protection code if the following conditions occur:

         1.  The /PROTECTION switch is specified.

         2.  The File Daemon is called  because  a  user  attempts  to
             create  a  file  in your directory protected against that
             user.

         3.  The File Daemon  allows  the  user  to  create  the  file
             (determined by the contents of ACCESS.USR).


/PROGRAM:file-spec

         This  switch  allows  the  specified  program  to  have   the
         specified  type  of access to the file.  This switch can only
         appear on the right side of the equal  sign  in  the  command
         line.  For example:

         ONE.TST/READ=[10,10],[10,65]/WRITE,[1,2]/PROGRAM:SYS:BACKUP

         where [10,10] jobs can read ONE.TST;  [10,65] jobs  can  read
         and  write  ONE.TST;   a  job  logged  in under [1,2] running
         BACKUP can read the file.  No other users can access ONE.TST.

         You may omit the device specification or you may specify DSK:
         or  ALL:   in  the  file-spec argument to the PROGRAM switch.
FLD1.DOC                                                        Page 9


         However, this is not a recommended  procedure  because  there
         may be potential security violations.  The File Daemon has no
         knowledge of your search list;  therefore, DSK:   is  treated
         identically  to ALL:.  It is recommended that the device name
         be either a file structure name or an ersatz device (LIB:  is
         not allowed, though).


/XONLY   This switch, when it appears in conjunction with the /PROGRAM
         switch,  will consider the program specified in the file spec
         argument to the /PROGRAM switch to match  the  program  doing
         the accessing only if this accessing program is execute only.


/ALL     ALL  access  is  allowed  when  this  switch  is   specified.
         Specified accessors of this file can change the protection of
         the file, rename, write, execute, update, and append  to  the
         file.  (This is the same as protection code 0).


/RENAME  Rename access is allowed.  Specified accessors of  this  file
         can  rename,  write, read, execute, update, and append to the
         file.  (This is the same as protection code 1).


/WRITE   Write access is allowed.  Specified accessors  of  this  file
         can  write,  read,  execute,  update, and append to the file.
         (This is the same as protection code 2).


/UPDATE  Update access is allowed.  Specified accessors of  this  file
         can  update, append, read, or execute the file.  (This is the
         same as protection code 3).


/APPEND  Append access is allowed.  Specified accessors of  this  file
         can  append, read, or execute the file.  (This is the same as
         protection 4).


/READ    Read access is allowed.  Specified accessors of this file can
         read  or  execute  the file.  (This is the same as protection
         code 5).


/EXECUTE Execute access is allowed.  Specified accessors of this  file
         can  only  execute the file.  (This is the same as protection
         code 6).


/NONE    No access is allowed to the  file.   (This  is  the  same  as
         protection code 7).


FLD1.DOC                                                       Page 10


ACCESS.USR is used to specify for each file  which  project-programmer
numbers  can access your files and what type of access those accessors
can have to the file.   The  switches  indicate  the  type  of  access
allowed.

Switches that appear on the left side of the  equal  sign  affect  all
project-programmer  numbers  appearing  on the right side of the equal
sign.  However, with the exception  of  the  /PROTECTION  switch,  the
switch   on   the   left   can   be   overridden   for   one  or  more
project-programmer numbers  on  the  right  by  explicitly  specifying
another  switch.   For example, if the following line appeared in your
ACCESS.USR:


          TEST.TST/ALL=[10,*],[11,*],[27,*],[17,*]/NONE


the File Daemon would allow all members of projects 10, 11, and 27  to
have  complete  access  to  the  file  TEST.TST.   However, members of
project 17 would be denied access to TEST.TST.  For PPN's  other  than
10,  11,  27,  17,  the  File Daemon would search for a later TEST.TST
which contained  the  accessing  PPN.   If  no  match  is  found,  the
accessing PPN's request is denied.

Full wild card specifications are allowed both on the left  and  right
side  of  the equal sign.  Comments and continuation lines are allowed
in ACCESS.USR.  A comment on a line or a comment line must begin  with
a semicolon or an explanation point.  A continuation line is indicated
by inserting a hyphen (minus  sign)  immediatly  proceeding  the  <CR>
which  terminates  the  current line.  If there is a syntax error in a
line in ACCESS.USR, that line  is  ignored.   You  should  ensure  the
accuracy  of  your own ACCESS.USR files by proofing carefully.  If the
following line were in your ACCESS.USR:

          FOO.BAR+[*,*]

the line would be ignored because a + sign appeared where  an  =  sign
should  have  appeared.   All  users  will be denied access to FOO.BAR
since the File Daemon denies access to  all  files  not  appearing  in
ACCESS.USR.   Since the File Daemon ignores the line, it does not know
that FOO.BAR is listed in the file.


EXAMPLE

The following is an example of an ACCESS.USR file which uses  most  of
the features of the File Daemon.


     Directory user = [13,675]

     Directory protection = <700>

     ACCESS.*/NONE=[*,*]         ;No one can touch the ACCESS.USR  and
                                 ACCESS.LOG  including [1,2] and JACCT

                                 be  backed  up  if the File Daemon is
                                 running.

                                 F1,F2,F3, catch [10,11] and permit no
                                 access.   Other  project  users   may
                                 EXECUTE   only  with  additional  log
                                 entries to record statistics.

     *.*/CREATE/PROTECTION:055=[12,21]/ALL,[12,17]

                                 ;[12,21] has privileges for all files
                                 (except   ACCESS.*)  and  may  create
                                 files which have a protection of 055.
                                 [12,17]  has  no  access  to any file
                                 (/NONE is a default) but  may  create
                                 files.  No log entries will be made.

     *.*/CREATE/PROTECTION:777/LOG=[123,456]/NONE

                                 ;[123,456] may create files  at  will
                                 but  may  not  access  them  (e.g., a
                                 student turning in homework).

     *.*[13,675,A]/ALL/PROTECTION:057/CREATE=[1,2]/LOG

     [13,675].UFD/LOG/READ=[*,*] ;Anyone may read this directory as  a
                                 file.

     F3.TST/LOG=[12,3]/EXECUTE
     *.*/LOG=[12,3]/NONE         ;[12,3]  may   execute   F3.TST   and
                                 nothing else.

     *.*=[*,*]/NONE              ;No other access is  granted  and  no
                                 LOG entry is made.


Note that entries are scanned from left to right  and  top  to  bottom
with  the  scan  stopping  on the first match of file on left of equal
sign and a ppn on the right side of the equal sign.   In  constructing
the ACCESS.USR file, care should be taken to see that a wild card spec
will not match in a line earlier than a specific spec in a later line.
As  a  general  rule  put  specific statements first with more general
"catch all's" later.  The user is also reminded that if he  wants  log
entries,  he  must  use  the  /LOG (any of and /EXIT, /CLOSE, etc.) on
every line for which this is true.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install the File Daemon (FILDAE) on  SYS  and  include  the  following
sequence of instructions in the OPSER AUTO file (OPR.ATO):


          :SLOG 1/2
          .R FILDAE


The File Daemon DETACHes itself and runs  unattended;   therefore,  it
does not monopolize an OPSER PTY.

If the File Daemon crashes for any reason, the operator should  ATTACH
to the File Daemon job and type the following:


          .R FILDAE


The operator should not log in another job and run the File Daemon, as
this action will not work.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Not applicable for this version.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

     1.  LOOKUP ACCESS.USR on the file structure where the file  being
         accessed  resides  (this is what is currently done).  If this
         LOOKUP fails because the file is not found, look it up on DSK
         using the SYS:  search list.

     2.  Allow passwords to be specified in  ACCESS.USR  and  ask  the
         user  attempting  to  access the file for the password before
         allowing access.

     3.  Allow a file specification as an argument to the LOG switch.

     4.  The 5 series file system  defines  17  levels  of  privileges
         which are mapped into the 8 levels of protection which may be
         specified in the  3-bit  protection  field.   Have  the  File
         Daemon  implement  switches  which  correspond  to privileges
         rather than the protection code.

     5.  Implement a mechanism to include or exclude calls to the File
         Daemon  on  a  per  directory  basis.   This requires monitor
         changes.
