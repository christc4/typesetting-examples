1.0  SUMMARY

FE is a utility for file transfers between the TOPS-10 file system and
the  FILES-11  file  system.   It handles protocol for the "FE" device
such that FE:  can be addressed as a FILES-11 device, usually  through
-11 PIP.

                           *** CAUTION ***

               The "FE" device is intended for use only
               in  software  development  and  updating
               procedures by knowledgeable people.  Use
               without   proper   caution  may  produce
               unpredictable results.

FE runs under TOPS-10 Release 6.03 and RSX-10F Release V5J or later.

FE depends on the existance of the RSX-20F task T20ACP,  which  should
reside on the -11 file system as "T20ACP.TSK".

Use of FE and file conversion procedures are described in the Guide To
Using the "FE" Device, USEFE.MEM.
