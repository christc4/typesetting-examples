AVAIL.DOC -- V2(30)
February 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

This is the first  release  of  the  availability  subset  of  SYSERR.
AVAIL.CBL  is  a  COBOL program which generates an availability report
similar to the CRASH AND UPTIME REPORT.

The report data base is a file written by DAEMON in the same format as
ERROR.SYS.   File entries consist of reload information, device status
change data,  date/time  changes,  and  other  pertinent  information.
AVAIL  reads this file by calling a MACRO sub-program which translates
the binary records into an understandable (to COBOL) format.

The report considers system statistics, device  outages,  and  monitor
failures.   Since DAEMON creates a new AVAIL file every week, the user
can select which week or weeks to be reported  by  doing  a  directory
search for SYS:AVAIL.*.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Users of earlier versions (prior to edit  30)  will  notice  that  the
default  input  file  specification  has  been  changed from AVAIL.SYS
(current week) to AVAIL.AXX (where XX represents  last  week's  file).
Reporting  the  current  week  is  still  possible  but is discouraged
because it would not represent a full operating cycle.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The accuracy of this  program  depends  heavily  on  correct  operator
responses  to  the "why reload" question and accurate insertion of the
time of day.  If "other" is selected  as  reason  for  reloading,  the
preceding down-time is not counted against availability.

An incorrect reload time should be fixed before another reload  occurs
to  avoid  negative  down-times  or  run-times.   Since  all date/time
changes are logged in the  AVAIL.SYS  file,  the  report  program  can
adjust  times as necessary by simply adding up the changes until a new
reload entry is seen.

Device status change entries occurring after the last reload entry  in
a  file  do  not  get  moved to the next week's file.  This means that
single-week reports will ignore some  device  outage  data.   Edit  30
fixes this problem if DAEMON provides beginning and ending time-stamps
in the AVAIL file.

Also, device outage accuracy depends on  operator  action.   A  device
outage  is  the  time difference between a DETACH/ATTACH sequence.  If
AVL2.DOC                                                        Page 3


one occurs without the other, the missing time-stamp will be filled in
from the operational-cycle beginning or end.

Total runtime and downtime figures  are  not  precise.   DAEMON  keeps
track of time by updating the availability file every six minutes.  If
a crash/reload sequence is  immediately  followed  by  another,  these
times  may  not  be correctly updated.  The report program compensates
for this by assuming the system  did  not  resume  service  after  the
previous reload (nobody had time to do any work anyway).



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See the AVAIL.CTL file.  AVAIL.EXE is formed by loading AVAIL.REL with
REDERR.REL.   AVAIL.REL  is  formed by compiling AVAIL.CBL with COBOL.
REDERR.REL is compiled from REDERR.MAC which searches  ERRUNV.UNV  and
SYRUNV.UNV.
