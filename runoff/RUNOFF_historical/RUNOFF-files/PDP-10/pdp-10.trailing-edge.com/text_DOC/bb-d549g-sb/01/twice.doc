TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V4A(25) to V4B(31)
March 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE is a program which runs under the TOPS10 monitor and is used  to
change the ONCE-ONLY disk parameters (eg.  SYSTEM SEARCH LIST, and can
refresh a file structure.

TWICE has been changed  to  load  with  version  7.01  of  the  TOPS10
monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  The "ALL" response to which structures to  refresh  has  been
         removed.

     2.  TWICE now asks "NOT NORMALLY DONE, ARE YOU SURE?" when  asked
         to  refresh  a  structure  which  is  not  marked  as needing
         refreshing.  In addition, if the structure is  marked  as  in
         the  system  search  list,  TWICE also asks "THIS IS A SYSTEM
         STR, ARE YOU POSITIVE?"

     3.  If "ALL" is typed as an answer to what disks to read or write
         TWICE  will  not type off-line messages for those disks which
         are off-line.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V4A(24) to V4A(25)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE has been changed to incorporate the fixes in 603A refresher.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

If FE.SYS exists on the structure it does not destroy it.  (Note  that
FE.SYS  is  not  looked  up but home block words 61 and 62 are used to
determine its existance.)



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     A.  Use distributed TWICE.EXE.

     B.  Use TWICE.CTL, or some reasonable facsimle thereof.

Note that all required modules must be assembled the for KI10.   TWICE
will  not  load  if assembled for the KL10.  Even though assembled for
KI, TWICE will run on any CPU.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

New (603A) REFSTR.

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V4(23) to V4A(24)
March 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE has been changed to assemble  and  load  with  version  6.03  of
TOPS10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Units that are down are now listed but a response (1, 2, or 3) is  not
required - same as "Q" response to regular monitor.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The file TWICE.CTL  will  produce  TWICE.HGH  and  TWICE.LOW.   It  is
recommended  that  the  TWICE.HGH  and  TWICE.LOW on the tape be used.
Note that the new version  of  TWICE  must  be  used  to  define  RP06
structures.  6.02 TWICE will not set up the correct values.

When we added RP04's we changed the MONGEN  dialogue  which  generates
HDWMAX (the maximal disk configuration) to contain two of each type of
disk controller (FH, FS, DP, RP) and the maximum number  of  units  on
each  controller.   This  was  done because we discovered that certain
macros in COMMOD blow up when more than eight controllers are defined.
Those  few  installations  with  more than two controllers of the same
type (most likely DPA's, DPB's, and DPC's) may remake TWICE for  their
configuration  or  else  live  with  the  restriction that TWICE won't
access units on the third controller (e.g., DPC's).

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V3A(22) to V4(23)
August 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE has been changed to assemble  and  load  with  version  6.02  of
TOPS10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Units that are down will now be listed in the section of units not  in
a  file  structure, as is done in version 6.02 of TOPS10.  This is due
to the high availablility feature which retains units in the unit data
block  chain  even  if  they  are down.  Twice now has a writable high
segment which should not be shared.  This change is  due  to  the  two
segment  monitor  feature  of  6.02.   The  number  of monitor buffers
reported by TWICE is now the result of  a  GETTAB  (%LDMBN).   If  the
gettab  fails,  TWICE  reports  the  value  that  was specified in the
hardware configuration file that it was assembled with.  This  version
of  TWICE  is  only  supported when assembled and loaded with material
from version 6.02 of TOPS10.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The file TWICE.CTL  will  produce  TWICE.HGH  and  TWICE.LOW.   It  is
recommended that the TWICE.HGH and TWICE.LOW on the tape be used.  Due
to a change in the HOM blocks in 6.02, this version of TWICE will  not
report  the  correct  value  of K for CRASH.EXE (CRASH.SAV) for a file
structure unless that structure was refreshed with TOPS10 version 6.02
or the equivalent.

When we added RP04's we changed the MONGEN  dialogue  which  generates
HDWMAX (the maximal disk configuration) to contain two of each type of
disk controller (FH, FS, DP, RP) and the maximum number  of  units  on
each  controller.   This  was  done because we discovered that certain
macros in COMMOD blow up when more than eight controllers are defined.
Those  few  installations  with  more than two controllers of the same
type (most likely DPA's, DPB's, and DPC's) may remake TWICE for  their
configuration  or  else  live  with  the  restriction that TWICE won't
access units on the third controller (e.g., DPC's).

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

EDIT 23  Satisfy undefined global requests new in TOPS10 version 6.02,
          change  down  unit  logic to account for the fact that units
          are never removed from unit data block chain,  write  enable
          monitor high segment so TWICE can write in it, GETTAB number
          of monitor buffers from current monitor.

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V3(21) to V3A(22)
January 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE now supports RP04's



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

When assembled and loaded with 507 or earlier monitor  modules,  TWICE
sometimes  fails  with  an  ILL MEM REF when using the DESTROY option.
This is a problem in ONCMOD which affects the DESTROY option only.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The file TWICE.CTL will produce TWICE.SAV.  It is recommended that the
TWICE.SAV  on  the  tape  be  used.   This TWICE should work under all
supported 5-series monitors, including  those  which  do  not  support
RS04's and/or RP04's.

When we added RP04's we changed the MONGEN  dialogue  which  generates
HDWMAX (the maximal disk configuration) to contain two of each type of
disk controller (FH, FS, DP, RP) and the maximum number  of  units  on
each  controller.   This  was  done because we discovered that certain
macros in COMMOD blow up when more than eight controllers are defined.
Those  few  installations  with  more than two controllers of the same
type (most likely DPA's, DPB's, and DPC's) may remake TWICE for  their
configuration  or  else  live  with  the  restriction that TWICE won't
access units on the third controller (e.g., DPC's).

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V3(17) to V3(21)
October 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE has been modified to support RS04's.  In  addition,  a  bug  has
been fixed which caused STOPCD's not to be printed.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.

option.   This is a problem in ONCMOD which affects the DESTROY option
only.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

TWICE.SAV on the tape be used.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

EDIT 20  Support RS04's.

EDIT 21  Fix problem with STOPCD's, change T4POPJ into a real  routine
         so SATCN in FILIO can use it.

TWICE.DOC -- Changes from V2 to V3(17)
Feburary 1973



1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE has been modified to run with 5.06 monitor sources or .REL files
and  incorporates  many  of  the  new  features  of the 5.06 ONCE-only
dialogue.  Also an optional scratch file has been added to  facilitate
debugging ONCE or TWICE.  TWICE version 3(17) requires 5.06 sources or
.RELS but should run on all 5 - series monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  The new once-only options  for  shorter  dialogues  for  disk
         parameter changes have been incorporated.

     2.  An optional scratch file has been added.  TWICE now asks  USE
         SCRATCH FILE (Y OR CR>)?

         If the answer is yes, file DSK:TWICE.BIN is created, allowing
         50  blocks  for  each "unit" as specified in COMMOD.  Further
         disk I/O is to this file instead of real disk units, so that,
         for  example,  real  HOME blocks are not clobbered.  I/O to a
         given block on a unit is changed to  mean  the  corresponding
         block  within  the  50  blocks  representing  the unit in the
         scratch file, using regular USETI/USETO instead  of  super - 
         USETI/USETO.  I/O to a block out of range is done to the last
         block in the file  for  that  unit.   The  number  of  blocks
         reserved for each unit is an assembly parameter BLKPUN:.  Its
         default value is 50 (decimal).  If the scratch file is  used,
         TWICE may be run under any PPN.

         If the answer to  the  question  is  no,  the  regular  TWICE
         dialogue proceeds.

     3.  The  routine  in  TWICE  which  satisfies  presumably  unused
         globals  from  the  monitor  routines has been changed from a
         POPJ to a STOPCD, so that if it is in fact being called, that
         will be discovered.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     1.  TWICE version 3(17) must be assembled  with  HDWCNF.MAC,  the
         same  HDWCNF.MAC  that  is  assembled  with  the COMMOD to be
         loaded with TWICE.

     2.  TWICE must be assembled with 5.06 versions of F.MAC and S.MAC
         (and  HDWCNF.MAC),  and  must  be loaded with .REL files from
         5.06 monitor sources.

     3.  Monitor routines ONCMOD, REFSTR, FILIO,  FILUUO,  FILFND  are
         declared  EXTERN  in  TWICE,  so  they  may  be  loaded  from
         TOPS10.REL in library search mode.  COMMOD  is  not  declared
         EXTERN since it is not in TOPS10.REL anyway.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  TWICE now handles off-line or non-existing units properly  by
         passing the proper bits to ONCMOD in the USRCPY routine.

     2.  STOPCDs have been edited to conform to the 5.06 standard  for
         STOPCDs.
