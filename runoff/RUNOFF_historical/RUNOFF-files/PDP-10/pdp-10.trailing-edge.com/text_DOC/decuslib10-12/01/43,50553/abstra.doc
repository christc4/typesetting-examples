of  files  which  have  been copied from the disk structures to magnetic
tapes at the end of each month, or at times set by some other  repeating
schedule.   The owner of the files specifies whatever is known about the
names of the files  and  about  when  and  where  these  files  existed.
Directory  files  must  be available on-line which contain a list of the
files which were saved on each of the sets of tapes.  The FNDFIL program
reads  the  directory  files  which  list  the  files  saved  during the
indicated range of  dates,  or  which  were  on  the  specified  private
structures,   and   reports   all   of  the  saved  files  matching  the
specifications stated by the user.
