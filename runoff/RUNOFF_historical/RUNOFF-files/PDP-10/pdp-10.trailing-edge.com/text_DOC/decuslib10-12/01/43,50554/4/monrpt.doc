                               24-Nov-82

MONRPT and RESP are programs for reporting operating system performance.
Both programs use GETTABs to obtain data from the operating system. RESP
types out the five response measurements kept track of by  TOPS-10.  Use
of the MONRPT program is described fully in its help file.

MONRPT and RESP are written in FORTRAN-10  (version  6).  However,  each
uses a subroutine module written in MACRO-10. They have been tested on a
KL-1090 running TOPS-10 version 7.01.

The core image file  MONRPT.EXE  may  be  created  using  the  following
sequences of monitor commands:

        .COMPIL MONRPT,PRF
        .LOAD MONRPT
        .SSAVE

The core  image  file  RESP.EXE  may  be  created  using  the  following
sequences of monitor commands:

        .COMPIL RESP,RSUB
        .LOAD MONRPT
        .SSAVE

Several debugging  procedures  and  test  files  are  included  in  this
package. The file DB.MIC produces DB.REL and DB.EXE which is a debugging
version of MONRPT.
