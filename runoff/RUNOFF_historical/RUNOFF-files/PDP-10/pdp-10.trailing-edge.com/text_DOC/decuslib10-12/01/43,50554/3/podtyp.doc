                               24-Nov-82

PODTYP is a  program  for  printing  files  on  user  terminals.  It  is
specifically  designed  to  allow  users  to control the output of files
which make use of the special features of DIABLO terminals. In  addition
it provides a number of features which are useful for conventional (TTY)
terminals as well. Use of the program is described fully in  the  PODTYP
help file.

PODTYP is written in MACRO-10. It has been tested on a  KL-1090  running
TOPS-10  version  7.01.  Compiling  and loading PODTYP requires that the
following files be in place:

        (1) UNV:UUOSYM.UNV
        (2) UNV:SCNMAC.UNV
        (3) UNV:MACTEN.UNV
        (4) REL:SCAN.REL
        (5) REL:HELPER.REL

Neither these files nor their sources are included  with  this  software
package  because  they  are  proprietary  and  are  available  only from
Digital. The latest CUSP tape should contain suitable versions of all of
these modules.

The core image file  PODTYP.EXE  may  be  created  using  the  following
sequences of monitor commands:

        .COMPIL PODTYP
        .LOAD PODTYP
        .SSAVE

Several debugging  procedures  and  test  files  are  included  in  this
package. The file DB.MIC produces DB.REL and DB.EXE which is a debugging
version of PODTYP. DIABLO.POD, GREEK.POD and TTY.POD  are  output  files
used to verify the proper functioning of the program.
