 1.0    SUMMARY



 1.1    QMANGR version 5A fully supersedes all previous  versions.  It
        was  specifically  tested with the following software versions
        as part of a larger maintenance  source  which  is  not  being
        released at this time.  thus edits 63-66 and 70-73, which have
        been published in the BULLETIN/DISPATCH have been omitted from
        this release.
