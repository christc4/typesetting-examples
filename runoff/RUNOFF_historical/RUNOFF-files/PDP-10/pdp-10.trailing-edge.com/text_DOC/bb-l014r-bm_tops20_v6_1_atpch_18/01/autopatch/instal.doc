           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-20  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-20  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 1.2 of ALGOL-20

            Version 2 of the APL products:
        
                APL-20
                APLSF-20

            Version 2.1 of BASIC-PLUS-2

            Version 13 of COBOL-20

            Version 6.1 of DBMS-20

            Version 4 of DECNET-20

            Version 11 of FORTRAN-20

            Version 1 of FTS-20

            Version 5 of GALAXY-20

            Version 2.1 of IBMCOM-20-ET
                                                                  Page 2



            Version 1.1 of IBMCOM-20-HASP

            Version 11 of MS-SOURCES-20

            Version 1 of PASCAL-20

            Version 1.1 of PSI-20

            Version 5 of SORT-20

            Version 6.1 of TOPS-20 and utilities

            Version 4 of TRAFFIC-20

     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.
                                                                  Page 3


     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  AP20:,  we
     recommend  that  you  make  an  entry in the LOGIN.CMD file and the
     BATCH.CMD file that DEFINEs AP20:  to be the structure you will  be
     using.   If  you  do  this,  you  will  not need to edit the Dumper
     Control Files used to set up the product  distribution  directories
     or  to retrieve patches.  The LOGIN.CMD and BATCH.CMD files must be
     on the PS:  structure for the account you will be logging  into  to
     SUBMIT  these  batch  control  files.   We  recommend  that you use
     <AUTOPATCH> as this directory name.

     The second save-set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save-set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  DUMPER  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in PS:<SUBSYS>  or  one  of
     the directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed in PS:<HELP> or one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following file should be installed in the  disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP201.PDF

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save-set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save-set also  contains  batch  control  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These "Distribution DUMPER Control" files are intended to run under
     batch.   They  issue  a  MOUNT request for the product distribution
     tape and then run DUMPER to restore the required  files.   See  the
     last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-20-V2  product  you
     would install

                APL2S2.CTL      for APLSF-20 rebuild
                APL2S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL2S2.DDC      for preparing distribution directory
                                                                  Page 4


        
     in the autopatching directory.
                                                                  Page 5


     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-20-V1-2  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL


     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-20
     distribution  tape BB-5471C-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the ALGOL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save-set "SOURCE files for ALGOL"
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
                                                                  Page 6


     a mount request for the ALGOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>ALGV12.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build process for ALGOL redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Both APL-20 and APLSF-20 are  autopatchable  with  Autopatch-10/20.
     Before  preparing  these  products for autopatching, they should be
     installed  on  your  system  as  described  in   the   installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.
                                                                  Page 8

     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING BASIC-PLUS-2

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  BASIC-PLUS-2  is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                BASIC.EXE
                BASOTS.EXE

     You will need to copy the following  files  from  the  BASIC-PLUS-2
     distribution  tape BB-5543F-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the BASIC-PLUS-2 distribution directory.

                B20OTA.REL

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the BASIC-PLUS-2  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.BASIC>.  If  you
     wish  to  use  this  control  file,  but  are  not  using  an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.BASIC>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>B20V2A.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last

     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 11


     3.4  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING COBOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  COBOL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                COBDDT.REL
                COBLIB.REL

                COBOTS-V13.EXE
                CPYLIB.EXE
                ISAM.EXE
                RERUN.EXE

     The COBOL V13 product may be patched via source file  updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files
     from the COBOL-20 V13 distribution tape BB-Z795A-SM into  the  disk
     directory you have set up as the COBOL-20 distribution directory.

        From save-set "SOURCE files for COBOL V13"

                COBDDT.KEY
                COBLIB.KEY
                COBOL.KEY
                COBOTS-V13.KEY
                CPYLIB.KEY
                ISAM.KEY
                RERUN.KEY

        If using COBOL-20 V13 with DBMS V6 or V6.1:

        From save-set "BUILDING files for COBOL V13"

                C8XSHR.REL

     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  COBOL  product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the COBOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.CBL13>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13.DDC
                for source file updating

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13R.DDC
                for EXE/REL replacement updating

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first save-set
     for  more  information.   The  Autopatch  build  process  for COBOL
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.

     If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will  need  to  copy
     the  following  files  from  the DBMS-20 distribution tape into the
     disk directory  you  have  set  up  as  the  COBOL-20  distribution
     directory.

                COPYRT.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the last save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue a mount
     request for the DBMS-20 distribution  tape  and  then  restore  the
     appropriate  files  to  the logical name DIS:.  In this batch file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS> and CDIS:  is  defined
     to  be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.   If  you  wish to use this control
     file, but are not using an  AP20:   structure,  you  will  want  to
     include  a  'DEF  AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file on the
     PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from  which  you  will  SUBMIT
     this  control  file.   However,  you will have to edit this control
     file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> or <AUTOPATCH.CBL13>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB2V61-CBL.DDC
        

     If you are NOT  autopatching  the  DBMS-20  product  the  selection
     process  for COBOL V13 will report checksum mismatches for the DBMS
     components of the COBOL compiler.  These messages can be ignored.

     Unlike the V6 product, the V6.1 Autopatch procedure  requires  that
     COBOL  and/or FORTRAN be built BEFORE the DBMS V6.1 Autopatch build
     is submitted.  The DBMS V6.1  Autopatch  procedure  will  implement
     DBMS within COBOL and FORTRAN.

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-20 V6.1

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-20  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DBMS.REL
                FORDML.EXE
                XDML.EXE


     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL        WILD.REL


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  DBMS-20  V6.1
     distribution  tape BB-4148F-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the DBMS-20 distribution directory.

                XDBIND.FIX

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DBMS-20 V6.1  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.

     If you wish to use this control file, but are not  using  an  AP20:
     structure,  you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> as
     the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB2V61.DDC
        

     Revised copies of DBCS24.CMD, DBCS28.CMD  and  DBCS2F.CMD  for  the
     DBMS-V6  product  have  been delivered on Autopatch tapes.  Be sure
     that these files are NOT in the common patching directory (PAT:).

     If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will  need  to  copy
     the  following  files  from  the DBMS-20 distribution tape into the
     disk directory  you  have  set  up  as  the  COBOL-20  distribution
     directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the last save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue a mount
     request for the DBMS-20 distribution  tape  and  then  restore  the
     appropriate  files  to  the logical name DIS:.  In this batch file,
     DIS:  is defined to be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.   In  the  DDC  file
     which  also prepares the COBOL-20 directory CDIS:  is defined to be
     AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBL13>.  If you wish to use this control file,  but
     are  not using an AP20:  structure, you will want to include a 'DEF
     AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD file on  the  PS:   structure
     for the LOGIN account from which you will SUBMIT this control file.

     However, you will have to edit this control file if you choose  not
     to  use  <AUTOPATCH.DBMS>  or <AUTOPATCH.CBL13> as the distribution
     directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB2V61-CBL.DDC
        

     If you are NOT  autopatching  the  DBMS-20  product  the  selection
     process  for COBOL V13 will report checksum mismatches for the DBMS
     components of the COBOL compiler.  These messages can be ignored.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build  process for DBMS redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.

     Unlike the V6 product, the V6.1 Autopatch procedure  requires  that
     COBOL  and/or FORTRAN be built BEFORE the DBMS V6.1 Autopatch build

     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET-20


     Before preparing this product for Autopatching,  you  MUST  install
     the   product   on  your  system  as  described  in  the  DECNET-20
     Installation Guide in Notebook  7  of  the  TOPS-20  Notebook  set.
     Unless  the product is correctly installed, you will not be able to
     SELECT it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for DECNET-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:

        CTERM-SERVER.EXE        NETGEN.EXE
        DNMAC.EXE               NFT.EXE
        DTEDMP.SYS              NIPGEN.EXE
        DTEMPS.SYS              NMLT20.EXE
        DTEMPT.SYS              SETHOST.EXE
        FAL.EXE                 TKB36.EXE
        NCPTAB.REL              VNP36.EXE
                                *.SYS

     *.SYS is the front end system file with your node name

     You will need to copy all of the files in the  PS:<DN20>  directory
     from  the  DECNET-20  distribution  tape  BB-H240E-BM into the disk
     directory you have set up as the DECNET-20 distribution  directory.
     These files should already exist in the PS:<DN20> directory as part
     of the original DECNET-20 installation.

     A batch control file to retrieve these files has been  included  in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request  for  the  DECNET-20  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore the third save-set to the logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DECNET>.  If you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DECNET>
     as the distribution directory.


        To execute this control file, issue the following command:

        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DEC2V4.DDC

     The DECNET-20 front end build also  requires  the  following  files
     from the original installation:

        CETAB.MAC
        NETPAR.MAC
        NMLACC.MAC

     The above files are NOT on the  release  tape.   They  are  created
     during  the  required  installation process.  NMLACC.MAC is deleted
     after  a  successful  front  end  build  to  protect  the   Network
     Management  Access Control information it contains.  Connect to the
     directory in which your front end was built and do the following:

        @NETGEN
        NETGEN>RESTORE xxxxxx.CNF

        ;where xxxxxx is your front end node
        ;name.  The configuration file (.CNF)
        ;was automatically saved when you did
        ;the original installation.

        ;If your site doesn't use Network Management Access Control
        ;skip the following 3 DEFINE commands

        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT USER foo1
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT PASSWORD foo2
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT foo2

        NETGEN>FINISH

     Copy  CETAB.MAC  and  NETPAR.MAC  into  the   DECNET-20   Autopatch
                                                                 Page 20


     distribution  directory.   If you wish the protection of having the
     NMLACC.MAC file deleted after a successful build,  rename  it  into
     the  directory you have set up as the DECNET-20 patching directory,
     and the above procedure will  be  required  before  each  Autopatch
     update of DECNET-20.  Otherwise, copy NMLACC.MAC into the DECNET-20
     Autopatch distribution directory.

     When SELECTing this product for Autopatching the PEP  program  will
     ask  for  the  nodename.   Use the same name as was used during the
     initial  installation.   If  your  product  installation  directory
     (INS:)  does  not  include  the  front  end  system  image, usually
     "nodename".SYS, then copy it into that directory.

     Connect back to your original directory.

     It is possible to use DECNET without the MCB  front-end  code.   At
     this  time,  the Autopatch process for DECNET requires you to build
     the MCB.  If you do not intend to use the MCB then you  may  SELECT
     DECNET  for  Autopatching  after 1) creating a null FOO.SYS file in
     the directory you intend  to  use  as  INS:   and  2)  copying  the
     CETAB.MAC, NETPAR.MAC and NMLACC.MAC files from the second save-set
     of the Autopatch tape into the area you intend to use as DIS:.

     When SELECTing DECNET answer the node name with FOO.SYS.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 21


     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-20   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                FORTRA.EXE
                FORO11.EXE
                FORLIB.REL
                FORDDT.REL


     The FORTRAN V11 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption the KEY files must be retrieved  from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-20 V11 distribution  tape  BB-4157I-SM  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-20 distribution
     directory.

        From the seventh save set

                FORTRA.KEY
                FORLIB.KEY
                FORO11.KEY
                FORDDT.KEY

     If you  are  also  using  DBMS  with  FORTRAN  you  will  need  the
     FORDBM.REL file from the first save set of the Autopatch tape.

     If  you  desire  to  Autopatch  FORTRAN  via  updated  sources  the
     following files are required.  They must be available either in the
     patching area (PAT:), the distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV
        MONSYM.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  FORTRAN-20
     distribution  tape BB-4157I-SM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the FORTRAN-20 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for  the  FORTRAN-20  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to  be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>.   If
     you  wish  to  use  this  control  file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>FTN211.DDC
                        for source file updating

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for  more  information.   The  Autopatch  build process for FORTRAN
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.
                                                                 Page 24


     3.8  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FTS-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  FTS-20  is  referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                FTS.EXE
                FTSLIB.REL

     You will need to copy the following files from the FTS distribution
     tape  BB-M251A-BM  into  the  disk directory you have set up as the
     FTS-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the second save-set
        
                FTSLIB.REL

        From the third save-set

                FTS20.REL

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the FTS-20 distribution tape and  then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTS>.  If you wish  to
     use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in  the  BATCH.CMD
     file  on  the  PS:   structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control  file  if  you  choose  not  to  use <AUTOPATCH.FTS> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>FTS201.DDC
        

     Since there is some file/module set-up processing and some  of  the
     files  must  be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file
     to set up the directory.

     The FTS product build also requires some files from  the  Autopatch
     tape.   The following files are put into the FTS patching directory
     by the DUMPER Control Files which process the Autopatch Tape.
                DAP2V1.REL
                XPN2V1.REL
                                                                 Page 25


     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 26


     3.9  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING GALAXY-20

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for GALAXY-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                BATCON.EXE      ORION.EXE
                CDRIVE.EXE      PLEASE.EXE
                GLXLIB.EXE      QMANGR.EXE
                GLXLIB.REL      QUASAR.EXE
                LPTSPL.EXE      SPRINT.EXE
                MOUNTR.EXE      SPROUT.EXE
                OPR.EXE

     The following files are required to build the GALAXY product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        ACTSYM.UNV      MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You  will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  a   TOPS-20
     distribution  set  into  the  disk directory you have set up as the
     GALAXY-20 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     mount requests for the TOPS-20 distribution tapes and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>.  If you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>GALV50.DDC
        

     If you use any of the TOPS-20 Monitor/EXEC DDC files, the  required
     files  for  this  product will be loaded into a common distribution
     directory which must be specified when selecting this  product  for
     autopatching.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.

     3.10  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING IBMCOM-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for IBMCOM-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
                                        HASP only

                D6TK3.BIN               D6TKH.BIN
                D6TK3.EXE               D6TKH.EXE
                D6TK3D.BIN              D6TKHD.BIN
                D6TK3D.EXE              D6TKHD.EXE

                IBMSPL.EXE

                D60SPD.EXE

     The following files are required to build the IBMCOM product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        ACTSYM.UNV      GLXINI.REL      GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL
        JOBDAT.UNV      MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV      MONSYM.UNV
        ORNMAC.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of  the  DUMPER  control  files  described in the README file.  The
     DUMPER control files will also load  the  PROD.P11  file  from  the
     Autopatch  tape  into  the same names as assumed below for the DIS:
     product distribution area.

       From a previous GALAXY Autopatch build or GALAXY Installation

        GALCNF.UNV      D60JSY.MAC      D60UNV.MAC

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS-20  IBMCOM
     distribution  tape  BB-D351C-SM (ET) or BB-J724B-SM (HASP) into the
     disk directory you  have  set  up  as  the  IBMCOM-20  distribution
     directory.
                                HASP only

        XTENCM.P11


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save-set on this patch tape.  This
     file will issue mount requests for the IBMCOM-20 distribution tapes
     and  then  restore  the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.
     In this batch file, DIS:  is defined to  be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.IBMET>
     or  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.IBMHSP>.  If you wish to use this control file,
     but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will want to  include  a
     'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the  BATCH.CMD  file  on  the PS:
     structure for the LOGIN account from which  you  will  SUBMIT  this
     control  file.  However, you will have to edit this control file if
     you choose not to use the supplied  defaults  as  the  distribution
     directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>IETV21.DDC      for IBMCOM-20-ET-V2-1
                or
        @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>IHSV11.DDC      for IBMCOM-20-HASP-V1-1
        

     The PROD.P11 file is included on the Autopatch  tape.   The  IETV21
     and  IHSV11 DUMPER command files to process the Autopatch tape will
     copy the PROD.P11 file to the default distribution directory.  This
     must  be  done  before  the  IBMCOM  products  will  be  able to be
     SELECTed.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER command file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
                                                                 Page 30


     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.

     3.12  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING PASCAL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for PASCAL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                PASCAL.EXE
                PASDDT.REL
                PASLIB.REL
                PASOTS.EXE

     The following files are required to build the PASCAL product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        CMD.REL         MACREL.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You  will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  PASCAL
     distribution  tape BB-P557A-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the PASCAL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the fourth save-set
        
                PAS2D1.REL
                PAS2L1.REL
                PAS2O1.REL

        From the fifth save-set

                HSPACE.REL
                PAS2C1.REL

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request  for  the  PASCAL-20  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.PASCAL>.  If you
     wish  to  use  this  control  file,  but  are  not  using  an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
                                                                 Page 33

        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>PAS2V1.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 34


     3.13  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING PSI-20 V1.1

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     This product is very closely related to the  DECNET-20-V4  product.
     In  fact,  there  are  many  common  modules.  We have designed the
     Autopatch process for PSI to use part of the Autopatch process  for
     DECNET.  You should read and follow the instructions for 'PREPARING
     FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET-20 V4'.  DO NOT, however, SELECT  DECNET-20
     for Autopatching.  The PSI products include the DECNET products and
     you  will  be  Autopatching  the  complete  product  set  when  you
     Autopatch PSI.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  PSI-20  is  referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging  to  SYS:.  In addition to the files listed in the DECNET
     section of this document, this directory must contain the files:
        
        PSITST.EXE      X25GAF.REL      X25GAM.REL      X25GEN.EXE
        X29SRV.EXE
        *.SYS

     where * is the desired node name for your  system  and  must  match
     your  response  to  the  node  name  question  which  is asked when
     SELECTing PSI for Autopatching.

     In addition to the files listed  in  the  DECNET  section  of  this
     document, you will need to copy the following files from the PSI-20
     V1.1 distribution tape BB-W661B-BM into the disk directory you have
     set up as the DECNET-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the third save-set
        
        FLN.STB         FLN.TSK         FLP.STB         FLP.TSK
        GAN.STB         GAN.TSK         GAT.STB         GAT.TSK
        NML.STB         NML.TSK         PLE.STB         PLE.TSK
        PLN.STB         PLN.TSK         PLP.STB         PLP.TSK
        FLPDLC.M11      GATLLC.M11      PLPLLC.M11

     Note that the NML.STB and NML.TSK files on the PSI distribution are
     different from the ones on the DECNET-20 distribution.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the PSI-20 distribution tape and  then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DECNET>.  If you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
                                                                 Page 35


     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DECNET>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>PSI.DDC
        
     Remember to FIRST use the  DEC2V4.DDC  file  as  described  in  the
     DECNET-20 section of this document.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.

     3.14  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  SORT-20  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories

                SORT.EXE

     The SORT V5 product may be patched via  source  file  updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     SORT  or  COBOL  distribution  tape.   You  will  need  to copy the
     following files from the SORT-20 V5 distribution  tape  BB-Z761A-SM
     or  the  COBOL-20  V13  distribution tape BB-Z795A-SM into the disk
     directory you have set up as the SORT-20 distribution directory.

                SORT.KEY

     If you desire to Autopatch SORT via updated sources  the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  SORT  product.   They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in INS:.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the SORT-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.SRTV5>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.SRTV5>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>SRTV5.DDC
                for source file patching from the SORT tape

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>SRTV5R.DDC
                for replacement patching from the SORT tape

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13.DDC

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL13R.DDC
                for replacement patching from the COBOL tape

     The use of one of the first two DDC files is only required  if  you
     do not have the COBOL distribution tape.  Use of either of the last
     two DDC files  will  load  files  into  both  the  SORT  and  COBOL
     distribution areas.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build  process for SORT redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the TOPS-20 product  distribution
     directory.
                                                                 Page 39

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     The following files were not delivered on the distribution tape and
     must be available in DIS:.  They are to be restored from the second
     save-set of the Autopatch tape:
                EDTHLP.RNO

     The UT2V61 DUMPER control files for the Autopatch  tape  will  load
     these files to PAT:.  They should then be copied to your DIS:  area
     for UTILITIES.

     You  will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  a   TOPS-20
     distribution  tape  into  the disk directory you have set up as the
     UTILITIES-20 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save-set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     mount requests for the TOPS-20 distribution tapes and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>UT2V61.DDC
        

     If you use any of the TOPS-20 Monitor/EXEC DDC files, the  required
     files  for  this  product will be loaded into a common distribution
     directory which must be specified when selecting this  product  for
     autopatching.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first save-set for more information.
