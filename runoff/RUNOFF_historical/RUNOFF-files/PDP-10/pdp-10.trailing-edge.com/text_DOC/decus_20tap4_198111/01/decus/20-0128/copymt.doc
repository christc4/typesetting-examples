COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                 Page 1


     COPYMT is a utility program to copy one magnetic  tape  to  another
with simple processing.  COPYMT replaces and supercedes MAGCPY and makes
full use of the new TAPOP. UUO in the 6.02 and later monitors.

     The general command format is:

                          ODEV:/SWITCHES=IDEV:/SWITCHES

Available switches:


     1.  /BACKSP:f:r
         Backspace f files and r records (see command note 6)

     2.  /BUFSIZ:n
         Use a buffer size of n (default=1024(10)).

     3.  /CLOSE
         Terminate log file output if it was open.

     4.  /COMMENT:"STRING-NO-DOUBLE-QUOTES .LE.  28.  CHARACTERS"
         SEND THE STRING INSIDE QUOTES TO THE LOG FILE.  IF NO LOG  FILE
         IS BEING MADE, THE SWITCH IS A NOOP.

     5.  /CONCAT:f:r
         Copy f files and r records, but do not copy ends-of-files.  The
         only  way  to  write  an end-of-file with /CONCAT is to use the
         /EOF switch (this also turns off  concatenation  mode),  or  by
         encountering  the  logical end-of-tape on the input tape.  (see
         command note 5)

     6.  /COPY:f:r
         Copy f files and r records (see command note 6)

     7.  /DENSITY:arg
         Set the magtape density to one of:  200 bpi (7-track only), 556
         bpi  (7-track  only), 800 bpi (default for 7-track, can be used
         on 9-track  also),  or  1600  bpi  (9-track  only,  default  on
         9-track).

     8.  /EOF
         Write an end-of-file mark.  This switch may appear on the input
         side,  but end-of-file markers are always written on the output
         tape.

     9.  /ERROR:arg
         Controls what happens when there is an input error.  ARG may be
         one of:

         1.  CONTIN
             Report the error and continue processing.

         2.  IGNORE
             Do not report the error and continue processing.
COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                 Page 2


         3.  QUERY
             When there is an error, prompt the terminal for an  option.
             See below.


    10.  /IBUF:n
         Use n input buffers (default=2).

    11.  /IFTYP
         Enable for type-in while COPYMT is processing  commands.   This
         switch is ignored in batch jobs.  Legal commands are:

         1.  E - Give error totals

         2.  I - Ignore further type-in (cancel /IFTYP).

         3.  K - Kill processing, return to command mode

         4.  P - Pause and wait for another character to continue

         5.  S - Give elapsed time and cpu time used

         Illegal commands will be answered with a bell.

    12.  /LOG:DEV:FILE.EXT[P,PN]
         Setup to send all messages from COPYMT  to  the  specified  log
         file  also.   This  switch  sticks  across  different commands.
         (i.e.  you can give several different commands and the log file
         will  be appended to with each successive command).  If /LOG is
         given   with   no   file   specification,   the   default    is
         DSK:COPYMT.LOG[-].   (If  parts  of  the file specification are
         missing, the missing parts are filled  in  from  the  defaults.
         The log file is opened after the whole command has been scanned
         and processing is ready to begin.  All the /CLOSE  switch  does
         is clear some flags and re-enable for another /LOG switch.

    13.  /MODE:arg
         Set the mode to one of:

         1.  BINARY (default)
             This is DEC-compatible core-dump mode (whatever  that  is).
             BINARY  mode is the mode all magtapes are written in on the
             DEC-10  when  no  other  special  mode  (see  INDUSTRY  and
             SEVENBIT modes) is used.

         2.  INDUSTRY
             Use industry-compatible 8-bit mode.  The lower  4  bits  of
             each word are ignored.  9-track only.

         3.  SEVENBIT
             This is the TU70 "marvelous  ASCII"  mode.   This  mode  is
             legal only on 9-track TU70 tape units.

COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                 Page 3


    14.  /NORETRY
         Disable monitor error retries.  Use on very  bad  input  tapes.
         This also disables /REPORT.  If error reporting is desired with
         /NORETRY, you must also specify /REPORT.

    15.  /OBUF:n
         Use n output buffers (default=2).

    16.  /PARITY:arg
         Set the parity for the tape unit to:  ODD  (default)  or  EVEN.
         Note that 9-track tapes are always written in odd parity.

    17.  /REPEAT:N
         Used only with /TEST or /TAPTST (see "Tape testing  facility").
         /REPEAT directs COPYMT to test the whole tape N times.  This is
         very useful with tapes that have not been exercised in  a  long
         time.   Note  that  /REPEAT  has no effect if /TEST is given an
         argument in the command (to only test part of the tape).

    18.  /REPORT
         This is used in conjunction with /NORETRY.  Unless /REPORT  has
         been specified with /NORETRY, input errors will not be reported
         to the user.

    19.  /RETRY:n
         When testing a tape, perform a maximum of n retries (default=4)
         before declaring the spot to be bad.

    20.  /REWIND
         Rewind the tape unit.

    21.  /SKIP:f:r
         Skip forward f files and r records (see command note 6)

    22.  /TIME
         At the end of  a  tape-to-tape  or  disk-tape  copy,  type  the
         elapsed and cpu time used.

    23.  /UNLOAD
         Rewind and unload the tape unit.


     Since COPYMT uses SCAN, all standard switches are  also  available.
Type /HELP:SWITCHES for a list of the standard switches.

     All switches except /BUFSIZ, /ERROR, /IBUF, /MODE, /NORETRY, /OBUF,
and  /REPORT  are  executed  in  the order they are given in the command
string.

example:

              MTA1:/SKIP:3=MTA2:/COPY:3:0/SKIP:1/CONCAT:2:0

COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                 Page 4


     The above command would skip 3 records on the output tape,  copy  3
files  from  the  input  to  the output tape, skip 1 record on the input
tape, and then concatenate the next two files from the input  tape  into
one file on the output tape.

                             COMMAND NOTES

     1.  Input and output devices must be magtapes and may  not  be  the
         same  physical magtape.  An extension to this is that if either
         the input device or the output device is a disk file,  it  will
         be  read(written)  in  IREAD  mode.  On tape, IREAD mode is one
         logical record/physical record.  On the disk, a record consists
         of a word count followed by that many data words.

     2.  When copying from disk to tape or tape  to  disk,  the  default
         extension  is  .DAT.  To get a null extension you must type the
         dot.

     3.  If no copy switch (either /COPY or /CONCAT) is given, the whole
         input tape is copied to the output tape.

     4.  /COPY, /CONCAT are illegal on the output specification.

     5.  An end of file is never written when /CONCAT is used except  at
         command  termination,  or  when /EOF is encountered.  Note that
         /EOF terminates concatenation mode.

     6.  To specify the number of files with /BACKSP, /COPY, /CONCAT,and
         /SKIP,  you  must  specify  the  number of records also.  (I.E.
         /BACKSP:3 means  backspace  3  records  and  /BACKSP:3:0  means
         backspace 3 files.)

     7.  COPYMT will  also  scan  SWITCH.INI  for  applicable  switches.
         Allowable  switches  are /BUFSIZ, /ERROR, /IBUF, /IFTYP, /TIME,
         and /OBUF.  This is dependent on feature test switch  FT$OPT=-1
         at  assembly  time  (default).   See  appendix  A  for  a short
         description of SWITCH.INI.


                        OPTIONS FOR /ERROR:QUERY

     When there is an error on the input tape, and /ERROR:QUERY has been
specified, the user has several options available:

     1.  C - copy this record (I.E.  record in error) and continue

     2.  D - dump record in error to LPT:COPYMT.LPT and ask again.

     3.  E - exit now.  if you type CONTINUE to the monitor, you will be
         asked again for an option.

     4.  G - same as "C", and change /ERROR:QUERY to /ERROR:CONTINUE.

     5.  H - type help message

     6.  S - skip this record (don't send to output tape) and continue.

                    OUTPUT TAPE END-OF-TAPE HANDLING
COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                 Page 6


     When COPYMT encounters and end-of-tape on the output tape, a double
end-of-file  is written, and the user is asked for an option.  Available
options include:

     1.  C - continue (assumes a new tape has been mounted).

     2.  E - exit.  A continue will again ask for an option.

     3.  H - type some help on the terminal.

     4.  R - rewind the output tape (see note below)

     5.  U - rewind and unload the output tape (see note below)



                                  NOTE

               Options "R" and "U" will again ask for  an
               option   after   the   action   has   been
               performed.


                      COPYMT-BATCH JOB INTERACTION

     When COPYMT is used in batch, it will interact  with  the  operator
under  certain conditions.  Currently, the only implemented condition is
output end-of-tape.  To enable batch to  use  this  facility,  you  must
include the line ".OPERATOR" in your batch control file before COPYMT is
run.  Then, any messages that require operator interaction will be  seen
on  the  CTY  and  the  operator will be able to handle the condition by
replying as outlined above.

     To reply to a batch job that has entered dialog mode, the  operator
must type:
            "B<sjob#>-OPERATOR <line><cr>"
where <sjob#> is the subjob number assigned by the batch controller  and
typed out on all messages to the operator, <line> is the line of text to
send to the batch job, and <cr> is a carriage return.

                          TAPE TESTING FACILITY

     A tape testing facility also exists in COPYMT.  This code is  under
the  assembly-time switch FT$TST (normally on).  This allows you to test
your tapes  by  writing  all  ones  with  the  monitor  error-correction
disabled,  so all bad spots will be seen by the program.  It is believed
that the verification feature  is  not  needed,  and  a  simple  FORTRAN
program can duplicate this feature if desired.

     To use the tape testing feature the command is:

          TAPNAM:/TAPTST
      or: TAPNAM:/TEST
      or: /TEST     (attempts to use logical device "TAPTST")

     The only other switches that may be applied  to  this  command  are
/REPEAT, /DENSITY and /PARITY.  COPYMT will test any tape at any density
and correctly report the length of the tape, as well as  the  bad  spots
and the total number of errors.  Use of the /REPEAT:N switch permits you
to test the tape N times (very useful with old tapes).

     In addition, if a number is specified with /TEST or  /TAPTST,  then
COPYMT  will  only  test that number of records, and will not rewind the
tape.  This is useful if you wish to strip some tape off  the  beginning
(I.E.  /TEST:20 would test 20 feet of tape and then quit).


                          MTAPE MONITOR COMMAND

     If COPYMT is assembled with FT$MTP=-1 (default), then  there  is  a
monitor command MTAPE available.  The command format is:

                  .MTAPE MTA:/S

where /S is one of /BACKSP, /EOF, /SKIP, /REWIND, or /UNLOAD.  A command
may contain several switches:

                  .MTAPE MTA:/REW/SKIP:100

This would rewind the tape unit and then skip 100 records forward.

                            COPYMT MESSAGES

Error messages:

     1.  ?CMTBTS MTA BUFFER TOO SMALL FOR RECORD SIZE = n
         COPYMT has encountered a record too large to fit in the magtape
         buffer  when  copying  from disk to tape.  The copy is aborted.
         You should respecify the command with a larger /BUFSIZ.

     2.  ?CMTCER COMMAND ERROR
         The command did not contain anything decipherable.

     3.  ?CMTCGH CAN'T GET HIGH SEGMENT
         COPYMT could not find its high segment.  This  message  is  not
         expected  to  occur.   Please  show the terminal session to the
         maintainer.

     4.  ?CMTCOD CAN'T OPEN DEVICE, FILE dev:file.ext
         The OPEN for the  specified  device  failed.   It  is  probably
         unavailable to you.

     5.  ?CMTDIF DSK IS FULL -- ABORTING
         This message may occur when copying from magtape to disk if you
         go over your logged-in quota.

     6.  ?CMTDNM DEVICE IS NOT A MAGTAPE - DEV
         The specified device is not a magtape.

     7.  ?CMTID7 ILLEGAL DENSITY FOR 7-TRACK
         The    only     legal     densities     for     7-track     are
         /DENSITY:200,/DENSITY:556, and /DENSITY:800.

     8.  ?CMTID9 ILLEGAL DENSITY FOR 9-TRACK
         /DENSITY:200 and /DENSITY:556 are illegal for 9-track magtapes.

     9.  ?CMTIM7 ILLEGAL MODE FOR 7-TRACK
         The only mode legal for 7-track operation is /MODE:BINARY.

    10.  ?CMTISO INPUT SWITCH ILLEGAL ON OUTPUT - SWITCH
         The specified switch may appear only with input specifications.

    11.  ?CMTLER LOOKUP/ENTER ERROR (N) FILE DEV:FILE.EXT

    12.  ?CMTMNA MTA IS NOT AVAILABLE - MTA
         The specified magtape is not available to your job.

    13.  ?CMTOSI OUTPUT SWITCH ILLEGAL ON INPUT - SWITCH

Warning messages:

     1.  %CMTIOE I/O STATUS = XXXXXX (YYY) ON DEV:FILE.EXT - CONTINUING
         The specified I/O error has occurred on DEV:FILE.EXT.  The  I/O
         error  bits are XXXXXX, with the decoding YYY, which may be one
         or more of:

         1.  IMP
             The tape is write-locked.  COPYMT  will  wait  for  you  to
             write-enable  it.   At  the  current  time, recovery is not
             available,  so  the  job   will   be   aborted   (temporary
             restriction).


                                        NOTE

                 Due to hardware restrictions the  operating  system
                 has  a  very  hard time telling if the IBM 729 tape
                 units are write-locked or not.  Therefore, you will
                 probably  not  see  this  on  the  729  tape units.
                 Rather, your job will probably go into IO wait, and
                 eventually you will get a hung device.



         2.  DER
             Device error -- data missed, tape is bad  or  transport  is
             hung.

         3.  PAR
             Parity error..

         4.  BKT
             Block too large -- you should recopy the tape with a larger
             /BUFSIZ value.


     2.  %CMTIOT TOTAL OF x yyyyyy ERRORS
         This is the summary line output at the end of a copy.  x is the
         total number of errors seen on yyyyyy (input or output).


Informative messages:

     1.  [CMTBKT BLOCK TOO LARGE ON INPUT--TRY LARGER /BUFSIZ]
         COPYMT has encountered a record too large to fit in the buffer,
         and  will  ask  you  if  you  want to continue copying.  If you
         answer "y", the copy will continue, else it  will  be  aborted.
         Note  that  this  message and the continue question will not be
         output to batch jobs, but the %CMTIOE I/O STATUS message will.


Operator messages:
These messages are also seen by the operator in a batch job  if  enabled
to do so (see note above on COPYMT-batch interaction).
COPYMT -- MAGNETIC TAPE COPIER (SON OF MAGCPY) %7                Page 10


     1.  %CMTOTF OUTPUT TAPE IS FULL
         The output tape is full.  You must mount a new tape and respond
         with the "c" option.

Tape testing messages:
These messages may be seen when using the /TEST (or /TAPTST) switch.

     1.  %CMTFAR FAILED AFTER n TRIES AT m FEET
         COPYMT has tried n times (assembly time feature=10.)  to  write
         on  the  tape  at  m  feet  and  failed.  This spot is probably
         unusable.

     2.  [CMTTNE TOTAL NUMBER OF ERRORS = n]
         This message is output at the end of the test and is  a  report
         of the total number of errors found on the tape.

     3.  [CMTTLI TAPE LENGTH = n]
         COPYMT writes one foot tape records, and has found  the  length
         of the tape to be n feet.













                              APPENDIX A

                         A PRIMER IN SWITCH.INI



     SWITCH.INI is an option file.  It allows you to place your favorite
switch  settings  in a file which is automatically read (unless disabled
by /NOOPTION) by several SYSTEM programs, COPYMT among them.

     The format of a line in SWITCH.INI is:
PROGRAM(:OPTIONNAME) /SWITCH/SWITCH.../SWITCH

     A PROGRAM NAME MAY BE IN THE FILE MORE THAN ONE TIME, BY ADDING  AN
OPTIONNAME,  preceded  by a colon, right after the program name.  Thus a
typical SWITCH.INI file might be:

LOGIN   /WIDTH:80/MESSAGE:NAMES/NORTCOM/PAGE/NOFORM
DIRECT  /WIDTH:80/OKNONE
DIRECT:WIDE     /WIDTH:132/OKNONE
COPYMT  /OBUF:6/IBUF:6/BUFSIZ:200
COPYMT:BIG      /OBUF:1/IBUF:1/BUFSIZ:4000

     AFTER COPYMT (or any other  program  which  scans  this  file)  has
accepted  a  command  from the user, SWITCH.INI will be scanned, and any
switches found for the program which have not been set by  user  command
will be applied.  Thus, if the user had a /BUFSIZ switch in his command,
the /BUFSIZ:200 in SWITCH.INI would not be applied.

     In addition, one may specify  the  desired  option  by  adding  the
switch  "/OPTION:NAME"  to  the  command  string (anywhere should do the
trick).  For instance, if you added  /OPTION:BIG  to  a  COPYMT  command
string,  the  line  beginning with COPYMT:BIG would be searched for.  If
the specifed option is not found, a warning message will be issued.












                              APPENDIX B

                       COPYMT INSTALLATION GUIDE



     1.  COPYMT must be assembled with MACRO %50 or later.

     2.  COPYMT  uses  DEC-supplied  universal  files  JOBDAT,   UUOSYM,
         MACTEN, and SCNMAC.

     3.  COPYMT loads REL:HELPER and rel:scn7b.

     4.  Feature test switches which may safely be changed are:

         1.  FT$OPT (default=on)
             If this switch is on,  SWITCH.INI  will  be  read  after  a
             command is accepted from the terminal.

         2.  FT$TST (default=on)
             If this switch  is  on,  the  tape  testing  code  will  be
             included.

         3.  FT$MTP (default=on)
             If this switch  is  on,  COPYMT  will  handle  the  monitor
             command  MTAPE.   This  requires  a  small  change  to  the
             monitor:
             In COMCON.MAC,  insert  "C  MTAPE,RUNFLG,RUNCMT"  into  the
             names   macro   somewhere.   Somewhere  convenient  (around
             runque) insert the following two lines:
