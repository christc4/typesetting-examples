FILCOM.DOC -- Changes from V21C(75) to V22(105)
June 1984



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a combination of a maintenance  release  of  FILCOM  with  the
added  support  for  /Offset  mode.   This  release  will  run  on all
supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


The /O (offset) switch has been added.  If this switch is used  in  an
ASCII, non-/U compare, the location of differences will be reported as
closest label+offset.  This assumes that the source file is a MACRO-10
or  MACRO-11 file, and that labels start in the first 10 characters of
a line.  PDP-11 local labels (nnn$:)  are  qualified  by  the  nearest
ordinary label.

The /T switch has been added.  This switch  causes  FILCOM  to  always
produce  an output file, even if no differences are encountered.  This
is intended for automatic procedures that  assume  that  a  file  will
always  be  created.   Note that /T has always been the default for /U
mode.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are no changes in the installation instructions.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.
Significant Edit #s

76     Add  support  from  ADP  for  /O  -  report   label+offset   in
       differences file.  This is useful for .MAC or .P11 files, since
       it  eliminates  ambiguity  in   reporting   the   location   of
       differences.

100    Don't get confused if someone does a CCL RUN UUO.
