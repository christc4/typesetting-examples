1.0  SUMMARY

NEBULA,  the  Network  Queue  Controller,  is  being  released  as  an
unsupported  tool  with GALAXY-10 on Autopatch tape 14.  NEBULA is the
interface to the  unsupported  Distributed  Queueing  System  software
available  from  Large  Systems  Marketing for use on VMS systems.  It
provides a means for queueing output requests  to  a  VMS  system  for
processing  on  that  system  (e.g., printing a file on a high quality
printer physically connected to the VMS system).



2.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Support in GALAXY-10 for the Distributed Queueing System is  contained
within  the  FTDQS  assembly  conditional.  The distributed setting of
this conditional excludes  commands  in  OPR  and  switches  in  QUEUE
related  to  DQS.   To  assemble  a  version  of  GALAXY including DQS
support,  you  must  answer  "YES"  to  the  GALGEN   question   about
site-specific parameters, and include the following line:

        XP      FTDQS,-1        ;Include DQS support

An  extra  carriage  return  is required after this response.  If your
site uses the distributed GALAXY.CTL file to build  GALAXY,  you  will
have  to  edit  the  control  file  to  make  this change, then submit
GALAXY.CTL to re-build the GALAXY system.

NEBULA.EXE is built via the control  file  NEBULA.CTL.   This  control
file may be submitted any time after GALAXY.CTL completes.  NEBULA.EXE
should be placed on SYS: and started during system initialization  via
SYSJOB.INI as is done with other GALAXY components.



3.0  OPERATION

3.1  DATA FILES REQUIRED

Two files relating to printer characteristics and forms type  must  be
obtained   from   the   VMS   system  and  installed  on  SYS: on  the
DECsystem-10.  These files on the VMS system  are  named  CHARTYPE.DAT
and  FORMSTYPE.DAT, respectively.  They should be installed on SYS: on
the   DECsystem-10with   the   names   CHARTY.DAT   and    FORMST.DAT,
respectively.



3.2  STARTING NQC STREAMS

You must start at least one NQC stream to  allow  NEBULA  to  transfer
requests  to  the  VMS  system.   If there is a large amount of remote
printing being done you may wish to start more than  one  NQC  stream.
NQC streams are started using the OPR commands below:

NEBULA.DOC -- DECsystem-10 Network Queue Controller             Page 3


        SET NQC-STREAM stream ATTRIBUTE OUTPUT-STREAM
        START NQC-STREAM stream

where "stream" is a stream number or a range of stream numbers  (e.g.,
"0" or "0:3").



3.3  DEFINING QUEUE NAMES

The names of remote  queues  must  be  defined  via  the  OPR  command
"DEFINE NETWORK-QUEUE".  The format of this command is:

        DEFINE NETWORK-QUEUE name type node:: object unit

where  "name"  is the name of the VMS queue, type must be "REMOTE" for
proper operation of DQS, "node" is the VMS DECnet node name,  "object"
is  the  object type of the remote queue (PRINTER, PLOTTER, etc.), and
"unit" is a unit number/class descriptor.   As  an  example,  the  VMS
queue SI$LN01 may be defined using the following command:

        DEFINE NETWORK-QUEUE SI$LN01 REMOTE JUNIPR:: PRINTER 0

The  object  type  and  unit data are included in case a user queues a
request on the -10 with /DEST:node/UNIT:n so those parameters  may  be
translated  into  the  appropriate queue name.  Use of the /QUEUE:name
switch in QUEUE is the preferred means  of  queueing  requests  to  be
processed by the VMS system.  (See section 3.4.)



3.4  QUEUEING REQUESTS TO THE VMS SYSTEM

Requests are queued to the VMS system  via  the  QUEUE  program.   The
standard command to enter an output queue request is modified by using
one or more of the following switches:

        /QUEUE:name     - enter the request in the VMS queue
                          named "queue"

        /CHARAC:string  - use the characteristics type "string"
                          defined in the file SYS:CHARTY.DAT

        /FORMS:name     - output the request on forms "name"

If  the  user queued the request with the /NOTIFY switch, they will be
notified when the request has been successfully transferred to the VMS
system.

For example, using the queue name SI$LN01 as  defined  above,  a  user
could  queue  a print request to VMS system JUNIPR using the following
monitor command on the DECsystem-10:

        PRINT FILE.EXT/QUEUE:SI$LN01/CHARAC:PORTRAIT/FORMS:3HOLE

3.5  LISTING THE REMOTE QUEUE

The remote queue (and requests in the local queue to  be  transferred)
may be listed via the QUEUE program.  The standard command to list the
queue is modified by using one of more of the following switches:

        /REMOTE         - list the remote queue (/DEST:node must
                          be specified)

        /QUEUE:queue    - list the remote queue named "queue"
                          (/DEST:node is ignored if specified)

In  addition,  the  remote  queue  may  be  listed via the SHOW QUEUES
command in OPR.  In this case, the  /REMOTE  and  /NODE:node  switches
must be specified in the SHOW QUEUES command.

For example, to obtain a listing of requests in the local queue to  be
transferred,  as  well  as  requests in the remote queue, a user could
type the monitor command:

        PRINT /LIST /QUEUE:SI$LN01




3.6  RELATED OPR COMMANDS

There are a number of commands in OPR which are related to DQS support
and  the  Network Queue Controller.  These commands (included the ones
already described above) are listed below:

        DEFINE NETWORK-QUEUE name type node:: object unit

        SET NQC-STREAM stream ATTRIBUTE

        SHOW NETWORK-QUEUE-NAMES
        SHOW PARAMETERS NQC-STREAM stream
        SHOW STATUS NQC-STREAM stream

        SHUTDOWN NQC-STREAM stream

        START NQC-STREAM stream




4.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
