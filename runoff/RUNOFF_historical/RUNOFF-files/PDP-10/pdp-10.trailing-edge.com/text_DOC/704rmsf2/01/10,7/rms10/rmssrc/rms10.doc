RMS10.DOC -- Version 1A(107)
January 1986


1.0  SUMMARY

This is release 1A of RMS-10.   RMS  provides  multi-key  ISAM  file
support  for  COBOL-74/V12C.   The  components  of  RMS-10  are  as
follows:

     RMS       The run-time system of RMS-10.
     RMSUTL    RMS file manipulation utility.

RMS requires V7.03 of TOPS-10.

RMS requires Version 12C of COBOL-74.

The relevant documentation is as follows:

     RMS Reference Manual (RMSREF.MEM on CUSP tape)
     COBOL-74/V12C Language Manual, Appendix I



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES -- N/A



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCES

     1.  RMSUTL does not handle stream, sequential, or relative files.

     2.  Only multi-key ISAM files can be accessed from  COBOL.   OPEN
         statements for RMS files may not contain the ALLOWING clause.

     3.  RMSUTL does not have facilities to display or  change  packed
         decimal or double integer fields.

     4.  If certain  prolog  fields  are  clobbered,  RMS  will  abort
         opening  of  a  file.   There  are no facilities in RMSUTL to
         "quick open" a file.  Thus it is not possible to  "unclobber"
         fields like ORG with RMSUTL.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Installing RMS

There is one save set on the TOPS-10 Cusp Update tape.  This save  set
contains  a  single  directory  which includes files related to RMS as
well as files related to other CUSPs.  To install RMS, you  should  do
the following:

     1.  Restore the Cusp tape to your designated disk directory,  and
         then print and read the following files:

               RMS10.DOC (this file).
               RMSREF.MEM (Reference Manual)

         The reference manual describes RMSUTL, RMS concepts, and  RMS
         status  codes.   It  is mostly of use to those who design and
         maintain RMS files.

     2.  Copy the following files to SYS:.   (or  [RUN-directory]  for
         testing).  These files are:

           B361LB.REL  ;Required to be on SYS:  for linking with RMS
           RMS.EXE
           RMS.REL
           RMSCOB.EXE
           RMSUTL.EXE
           RMSINT.REL  ;Required to be on SYS:  for relinking RMS.

         RMS is now ready to use.  If you are going to run UETP tests,
         do steps 3 and 4, otherwise go to step 5.

     3.  Copy the UETP modules to  the  directory  UTP:([5,33]).   The
         UETP modules are:

           RMS.VER
           RMTMKI.CBL
           RMTNAM.UTL
           RMTOK.MST
           RMTOK.UTL

         This is a self-checking group of tests, run under UETP,  that
         exercise RMSUTL.

     4.  Run the UETP tests using the following procedure:

           .R SETSRC
           PATH[RUN-directory] ;unless [RUN-directory] is SYS:
           LIB:[5,33] ;=UTP:, so UETP can find tests
           .RU UTP:UETP
           DEFAULT/DEPTH:VER
           ENABLE RMS
           BEGIN
           EXIT
           .DELETE RMS.LOG,RUN.LOG,EXCEPT.LOG

     5.  Run  your  own  tests  if  desired.    This   concludes   the
         installation.

     6.  If [RUN-directory] is  not  SYS:,  install  RMS  software  by
         giving the following command:

              COPY SYS:*.*=[RUN-directory]*.*

4.2  Rebuilding RMS

Maintenance on RMS will be done via DDT patches and AUTOPATCH.  If, in
the future, you use AUTOPATCH, you will need to rebuild the software.

Included on  the  Cusp  tape  are  linkable  files  for  creating  RMS
executable (.EXE) files.

To rebuild RMS you  should  copy  the  following  files  to  an  empty
directory:

     RMS101.REL
     RMS1C1.LNK
     RMS1L1.CCL
     RMS1P1.REL
     RMS1S1.LNK
     RMS1U1.LNK
     RMS1U1.REL

You should then follow procedures documented in the AUTOPATCH kit.
