TRACK.DOC -- CHANGES FROM V4 TO V5(216)
November 1982



1.0  SUMMARY

     The Purpose of  this  release  is  to  give  TRACK  the
capability  of  monitoring  systems  with  greater  than two
processors, to use more of the KL10's hardware features  for
performance   monitoring,   and  to  report  on  information
available via the SCHED UUO.

     TRACK requires field image HELPER.REL in order to  type
out  the  help  file  TRACK.HLP,  which  should be placed on
either HLP:  or SYS:

     TRACK also  requires  MACTEN  and  UUOSYM  for  correct
compilation



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     The most noticable changes relate to the new data being
output,  and  the general order of the outputted data.  When
per-processor information is output, it is  now  ordered  by
the  TYPE  of information being presented, not the PROCESSOR
for which it pertains.  This means, for instance,  that  all
of  the  processors'  IDLE TIMES will appear together.  This
seems more usefull that to put all of  the  information  for
CPU0   together,  then  all  of  the  information  for  CPU1
together, etc.

     The second difference is the addition of  a  new  block
type  (732)  to  the  /FORMAT:TRACE  output file, which will
contain the extended scheduler performance information.  All
documentation  on the format of the TRACE file now exists in
the TRACK.MAC source file, following the EDIT HISTORY.   The
file TRKTRC.DOC is now obsolete.

     A few new switches have been added in v5 of TRACK:

     1.  /DAILY - this allows the use  of  /FORMAT:TRACE  to
         produce a new output file each day at midnight
     2.  /METER & /NOMETER - this gives control over the use
         of   the   KL10   meter  boards,  used  to  collect
         statistics in v5 for MBOX reference counts, and for
         the amount of time spent in EXEC mode.  Since TRACK
         will grab the clock(s) when  it  starts,  and  keep
         them,  these  switches  (and  the /METER?  switches
         below) are used to control this process.
     3.  /METER?  - allows the use of the  meter  boards  on
         specific  processors  (the  ?   is  a  digit from 0
         through 5)

     Note  that  the  parsing  action  of  the  meter  board
switches  is  controlled  by the order in which the switches
are encountered.




3.0  KNOWN V4 TO V5 DIFFERENCES

     THE ONLY KNOWN  DIFFERENCE  IS  THE  NUMBERING  OF  THE
RECORDS  IN  TRACE MODE.  ALL RECORD TYPES AE NOW IN THE 700
RANGE.



4.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     TRACK has not been tested with monitors older than 7.01
TRACK  output  can be inaccurate on a heavily loaded system,
if the tracking job is not run in an HPQ and LOCKed in core.
TRACK  runs  most  effeciently  if it can SPY on the monitor
core



5.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     TRACK is compiled from the source file TRACK.MAC.   The
loaded  program  can  then  be saved as either an EXE or SAV
file.  It is recommended that TRACK be assembled with PURESW
set  to  0  (default),  so that the high segment can be made
into a SPY segment at runtime.
