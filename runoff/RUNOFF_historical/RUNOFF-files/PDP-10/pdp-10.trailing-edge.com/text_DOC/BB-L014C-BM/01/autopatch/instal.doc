	       Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.0
	       -------------------------------------------------
	
	
	1.0  INTRODUCTION
	
	This document describes the procedures necessary to set up your
	DECSYSTEM-20 for patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.  It
	augments the information provided in chapter 2 of the Autopatch
	Procedures/Reference Manual.  This initialization operation is
	required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be
	able to apply the patches distributed periodically in the
	Autopatch Kits.
	
	In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create
	a disk directory referred to as the autopatching directory.
	This directory is used to patch and rebuild the software.  In
	the autopatching directory you must install some of the files
	supplied on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this
	document.
	
	In addition, you must also prepare a distribution directory for
	each product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is
	described for each of the autopatchable products in sections 3
	and 4 of this document.
	
	For the DECSYSTEM-20 the following products are currently
	autopatchable:
	
	    The release 4 monitor and EXEC for the following systems:
	
	        TOPS-20-2020
		TOPS-20-2040 / TOPS-20-2050
		TOPS-20-2060
		TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
		TOPS-20-KS-ARPA
	
	    Version 2 of the APL products:
	
		APL-20
		APLSF-20
	
	Autopatch V1 is supported for applying only those patches
	provided by Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an
	Autopatch Kit.  Furthermore, those patches are supported for
	distributed (field-image) software or distributed software that
	has been modified only by autopatching.

	2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH
	
	
	If you are not using an autopatching structure named AP20:, we
	recommend that you make an entry in the LOGIN.CMD file and the
	BATCH.CMD file that DEFINEs AP20:  to be the structure you will
	be using.  If you do this, you will not need to edit the Dumper
	Control Files used to set up the product distribution
	directories or to retrieve patches.  The LOGIN.CMD and BATCH.CMD
	files must be on the PS:  structure for the account you will be
	logging into to SUBMIT these batch control files.  We recommend
	that you use <AUTOPATCH> as this directory name.
	
	  The second save set of the patch tape contains tools and
	control files that are used in the autopatching operation.  A
	list of all the files in this save set is given in section 5 of
	this document.  Use the DUMPER program to restore from this save
	set to the appropriate disk directories those files you need.
	
	The following files should be installed in PS:<SUBSYS> or one of
	the directories belonging to SYS:
	
		PEP.EXE
		PEPB.EXE
	
	The following file should be installed in PS:<HELP> or one of
	the directories belonging to HLP:
	
		PEP.HLP
	
	The following file should be installed in the disk directory you
	have set up as the autopatching directory:
	
		PEP201.PDF
	
	In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file
	must be installed in the autopatching directory for each product
	you intend to autopatch.  These files are in the installation
	save set of the patch tape.
	
		APL2S2.CTL	for APLSF-20
		APL2B2.CTL	for APL-20
		T20204.CTL	for TOPS-20-2020
		T20404.CTL	for TOPS-20-2040 or TOPS-20-2050
		T20604.CTL	for TOPS-20-2060
		T20AL4.CTL	for TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
		T20AS4.CTL	for TOPS-20-KS-ARPA

	The installation save set also contains batch control files to
	assist you in setting up the product distribution directories.
	These "Distribution DUMPER Control" files are intended to run
	under batch.  They issue a MOUNT request for the product
	distribution tape and then run DUMPER to restore the required
	files.  The files are:
	
		APL2S2.DDC	for preparing APLSF-20 distribution area
		APL2B2.DDC	for preparing APL-20 distribution area
		T20204-SML.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2020
				   distribution area for SMALL monitor
		T20204-MED.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2020
				   distribution area for MEDIUM monitor
		T20404-SML.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2040 / 2050
				   distribution area for SMALL monitor
		T20404-SML-128.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2040 / 2050
				   distribution area for SMALL monitor (128K)
		T20404-MED.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2040 / 2050
				   distribution area for MEDIUM monitor
		T20404-BIG.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2040 / 2050
				   distribution area for BIG monitor
		T20404-BCH.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2040 / 2050
				   distribution area for BATCH monitor
		T20604-BIG.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2060
				   distribution area for BIG monitor
		T20604-MAX.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-2060
				   distribution area for MAXIMUM monitor
		T20AL4-SML.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
				   distribution area for SMALL monitor
		T20AL4-MED.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
				   distribution area for MEDIUM monitor
		T20AL4-BIG.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
				   distribution area for BIG monitor
		T20AL4-LGE.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KL-ARPA
				   distribution area for LARGE monitor
		T20AS4-SML.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KS-ARPA
				   distribution area for SMALL monitor
		T20AS4-MED.DDC  for preparing TOPS-20-KS-ARPA
				   distribution area for MEDIUM monitor
	
	For each product you intend to autopatch, you should install the
	associated control files in the autopatching directory.  For
	example, if you intended to autopatch a 2060 monitor with a
	MAXIMUM system configuration, you would install the files
	
		T20604.CTL	for TOPS-20-2060
		T20604-MAX.DDC  for preparing distribution directory
	
	in the autopatching directory.  If you also intended to autopatch
	APLSF-20, you would also install the files
	
		APL2S2.CTL	for APLSF-20
		APL2S2.DDC	for preparing APLSF-20 distribution directory
	
	in the autopatching directory.

	3.0  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL
	
	Both APL-20 and APLSF-20 are autopatchable with Autopatch-10/20.
	Before preparing these products for autopatching, they should be
	installed on your system as described in the installation
	documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.
	
	To make the product autopatchable, some of the files from the
	product distribution tape will have to be installed in the disk
	directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.
	Refer to section 3.1 for APL-20 or section 3.2 for APLSF-20 to
	determine which files you need.

	January 5, 1981
	
	
	
	
	3.1  APL-20
	
	The disk directory in which you have installed the executable
	files for APL-20 is referred to as the product installation
	directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the
	directories belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain
	the files:
	
		APL.EXE
		GENBAS.EXE
	
	You will need to copy the following files from the APL-20
	distribution tape BB-5135E-BM into the disk directory you have
	set up as the APL-20 distribution directory.
	
	   From save set "REL LIBRARY FOR TOPS-20 APL-BASIC VERSION 2"
	
		APLB22.REL
		APLH22.REL
		APLB22.LNK
		APLH22.LNK
	
	A batch control file to perform this operation has been included
	in the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will
	issue a mount request for the APL-20 distribution tape and then
	restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
	batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APL>.  If you
	wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
	structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command
	in the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN
	account from which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However,
	you will have to edit this control file if you choose not to use
	<AUTOPATCH.APL> as the distribution directory.
	
	To execute this control file, issue the following command:
	
	   @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>APL2B2.DDC

	3.2  APLSF-20
	
	The disk directory in which you have installed the executable
	files for APLSF-20 is referred to as the product installation
	directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one of the
	directories belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain
	the files:
	
		APLSF.EXE
		GENSF.EXE
		APLTAP.EXE
	
	You will need to copy the following files from the APLSF-20
	distribution tape BB-5137E-BM into the disk directory you have
	set up as the APLSF-20 distribution directory.
	
	   From save set "REL LIBRARY FOR TOPS-20 APLSF VERSION 2"
	
		APLS22.REL
		APLG22.REL
		APLW22.REL
		APLS22.LNK
		APLG22.LNK
		APLW22.LNK
	
	A batch control file to perform this operation has been included
	in the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will
	issue a mount request for the APLSF-20 distribution tape and
	then restore the appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In
	this batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APL>.
	If you wish to use this control file, but are not using an AP20:
	structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command
	in the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN
	account from which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However,
	you will have to edit this control file if you choose not to use
	<AUTOPATCH.APL> as the distribution directory.
	
	To execute this control file, issue the following command:
	
	   @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>APL2S2.DDC

	4.0  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TOPS-20
	
	The monitor and EXEC for all supported hardware configurations
	are autopatchable with Autopatch-10/20.  Before preparing
	TOPS-20 for autopatching, the monitor and EXEC should be
	installed on your system as described in the installation
	documentation for TOPS-20.  The directory PS:<SYSTEM> in which
	you have installed the executable files for the monitor and EXEC
	is referred to as the installation directory.  This directory
	must contain the files:
	
		MONITR.EXE
		EXEC.EXE
		BUGSTRINGS.TXT
	
	To make the product autopatchable, some of the files from the
	product distribution tape will have to be installed in the disk
	directory that you have set up as the TOPS-20 product
	distribution directory.  Refer to sections 4.1 through 4.5 to
	determine which files you need for your particular TOPS-20
	configuration.
	
	
	
	4.1  TOPS-20-2020
	
	For TOPS-20-2020, you will need to obtain files from the
	distribution tape BB-868C-BM.  A batch control file to perform
	this operation has been included in the installation save set on
	this patch tape.  This file will issue a mount request for the
	TOPS-20 distribution tape and then restore the appropriate files
	to the logical name DIS:.  In this control file, DIS:  is
	defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS20>.  If you wish to use this
	control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you will
	want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD
	file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from which you
	will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit
	this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS20> as
	the distribution directory.  After creating the product
	distribution directory, submit the required control file as a
	batch job.
	
	   @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>T20204-SML.DDC	for SMALL monitor
	   @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>T20204-MED.DDC	for MEDIUM monitor
	
	Since there are a number of files involved and some of the files
	must be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file to
	set up the directory.

	For TOPS-20-2040 and TOPS-20-2050, you will need to obtain files
	from the distribution tape BB-4712G-BM.  A batch control file to
	perform this operation has been included in the installation
	save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue a mount
	request for the TOPS-20 distribution tape and then restore the
	appropriate files to the logical name DIS:.  In this control
	file, is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish to
	use this control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
	you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the
	BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
	which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have
	to edit this control file if you choose not to use
	<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20> as the distribution directory.  After
	creating the product distribution directory, submit the required
	control file as a batch job.
	
	   @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>T20404-SML.DDC	for SMALL monitor
