   1.0  DISTRIBUTION TAPE DIRECTORIES


   There are four  subdirectories  on  the  DECmail/MS  distribution
   tape:

         o  Directory DSKB:[10,7,MAIL,DOC] contains the installation
            instructions  (INSTAL.DOC),  the  DECmail/MS user manual
            (MS.MAN), and the beware file (MS.BWR).

         o  Directory DSKB:[10,7,MAIL] contains the DECmail/MS  help
            file   (MS.HLP)  and  the  DECmail/MS  executable  files
            (MS.EXE and MX.EXE).

         o  Directory DSKB:[10,7,MAIL,MS] contains  the  source  and
            relocatable  files  for  the MS program.  MS is the user
            interface.

         o  Directory DSKB:[10,7,MAIL,MX] contains  the  source  and
            relocatable  files  for  the  MX  program.   MX  manages
            message transport and delivery.





   2.0  INSTALLATION PROCEDURES


        1.  Use BACKUP to transfer the contents of the tape  to  the
            appropriate directories.

            To do this, mount the tape,  then  enter  the  following
            commands:

            R BACKUP
            /TAPE MTxn
            /REWIND
            /FILES    ;This is optional
            /RESTORE DSK:*.*[10,7,MAIL,*]=DSKB:*.*[10,7,MAIL,*]
            /EXIT

        2.  Copy the executable and help files to SYS:

            COPY SYS:=MS.EXE[10,7,MAIL]
            COPY SYS:=MX.EXE[10,7,MAIL]
            COPY HLP:=MS.HLP[10,7,MAIL]
   INSTALLING DECmail/MS SOFTWARE                             Page 2


        3.  Create a UFD for  UPS:[5,35]  if  it  does  not  already
            exist:

            R CREDIR
            UPS:[5,35]
            ^Z

            The MX program uses  the  system-defined  ersatz  device
            UPS:   for  its  scratch  files.   For example, incoming
            network mail is  stored  in  this  directory  before  MX
            distributes  it  to its final destination.  In addition,
            MX puts  tracking  information  in  log  files  in  this
            directory.   You  also  put the optional network-related
            files there, as described below.

        4.  MX should be run as a [1,2] job that  starts  at  system
            startup.   To  do this, insert the following commands in
            the file SYSJOB.INI.

            LOG
            MX


        5.  To start MX immediately after installation,  you  should
            run  it and then DETACH from it.  The following commands
            are an example of an easy way to  do  this  if  you  are
            logged in to [1,2]:

            R OPSER
            :SLOG
            R MX
            :MONITOR      ;This will get you back to monitor level


            At this point, the installation is complete and you  may
            now use the new MS.




   3.0  OPTIONAL PROCEDURES


         o  When MX detects a fatal error, it can automatically dump
            and restart itself.  It dumps itself to DUMP:MXDnnn.EXE,
            where nnn is the first number that makes MXDnnn unique.

            Then, the program that the "pathological" device  RUNMX:
            points  to  is  run.   To  activate the dump and restart
            capabilities, define DUMP:  and RUNMX:.

            Note  that  if  DDT  was  linked  into  MX.EXE,  DDT  is
   INSTALLING DECmail/MS SOFTWARE                             Page 3


            automatically  executed  when  MX  crashes,  but  MX  is
            neither dumped nor restarted.

         o  Create the file UPS:DNHOST.TXT if:

             o  You have a DECnet network with Phase 3 nodes out  of
                the  area.   Put  the  names  and routing strings of
                these nodes in this file.

                EXAMPLE

                SYSA,SYSB::SYSA::

                In this example, SYSA is a Phase 3 system in another
                area,  and SYSB is a Phase 4 system in the same area
                as SYSA.

             o  There are DECnet nodes that  you  do  not  want  the
                DECmail/MS  system  to recognize.  Users will not be
                able to send mail to these nodes.  However, mail can
                be  received  from them.  Add the /INVALID switch to
                the entry in the DNHOST.TXT file.

                EXAMPLE

                SYSA/INVALID
                SYSG/INVALID





   4.0  BUILDING MS AND MX FROM SOURCES


         o  In the MS sources directory is a file  called  MS10.CTL,
            which  will  build  MS.  By default, all sources will be
            recompiled by this  control  file.   If  you  have  only
            edited  a few source files, specify /TAG:NOCOMP when you
            submit the control file, and only the files  which  have
            been changed will be recompiled.

         o  In order to rebuild MX completely from the  MX  sources,
            you  must  have the BLISS-36 compiler.  Use the MX10.CTL
            file to rebuild MX.

   5.0  TAILORING MX TO YOUR MAIL TRAFFIC NEEDS

   You can change the default number of SMTP or MAIL-11 listeners to
   handle  heavier  SMTP  or  VMS mail traffic loads.  The number of
   SMTP listeners to be started up is in location NSMTP.  The number
   of  MAIL-11  listeners  to  be  started  up is in location NVM11.
   These can be "poked" with DDT before starting MX  to  change  the
   default  values.   The default values are 2 SMTP listeners, and 3
   MAIL-11 listeners.

   Alternatively, you can edit NETTAB.MAC and  change  the  literals
   DNSMTP  and  DNVM11  to  appropriate  values, compile NETTAB, and
   relink MX...

   Please refer to the MS.BWR file for more information about  MS/MX
   options.
