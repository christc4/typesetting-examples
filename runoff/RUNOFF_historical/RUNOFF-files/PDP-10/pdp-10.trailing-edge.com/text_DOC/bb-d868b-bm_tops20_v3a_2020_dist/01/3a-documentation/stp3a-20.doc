1.0  SUMMARY

3A-SETSPD  is  a  privileged  system  program  which   processes   the
3A-CONFIG.CMD  file  and,  in  so  doing, sets many initial parameters
about the system such as:  initial line speeds, system logical  names,
and magtape logical to physical correspondences.

3A-SETSPD version 3A(7) runs only on Release 3A of TOPS-20.

3A-SETSPD depends on the file PS:<SYSTEM>3A-CONFIG.CMD.

     NODE  name  number

SETSPD is run automatically by the monitor  when  it  is  started  and
whenever one of the front end PDP11's is reloaded.  It need however be
run under timesharing.
