CREF.DOC -- Changes from V52B(40) to V53A(60)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

CREF takes  the  modified  listing  files  produced  by  the  language
processors   and  produces  a  final,  printable  listing  with  cross
reference tables appended.

CREF version 53A(60) runs on TOPS-20 Release 3A.

CREF is documented in the DECSYSTEM-20 User's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

CREF now allows filenames and switches on the same line as the command
that invoked CREF.  For example:

     @CREF/O

will cause all files that have previously been compiled with the /CREF
switch  to  be cross referenced with CREF's /O switch.  Also, commands
of the form

     @CREF file

will cause the file "file.CRF" to be processed.

CREF  now  allows  line-sequenced  FORTRAN  programs   to   be   cross
referenced.   Previous  version  of  CREF  failed  if  the  input file
included page marks or FORTRAN INCLUDE statements.

CREF can now read switches from the standard SWITCH.INI file.

The command scanner has  been  enhanced:   such  things  as  comments,
continuation lines, and indirect files are now accepted.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None as of 1-Jan-78.
