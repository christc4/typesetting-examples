CONV20.DOC -- Version 3(5)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

CONV20 is a program which converts USAGE file format to the FACT  file
format  supported  in  Release  3A  (See  the  DECSYSTEM-20 USAGE File
Specification for  a  complete  description  of  the  USAGE  and  FACT
formats.) This program is the only program that supports the FACT file
in Release 3A.  It is needed if an installation is  dependent  on  the
mixed-mode  FACT  format.   Note  that  Release 3A outputs USAGE files
only.

CONV20 does not depend on any other software during its execution.

CONV20 is only documented in this document  and  in  CONV20.HLP  file.
Read CONV20.HLP for instructions on how to use this program.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are some differences in the FACT files that CONV20 produces than
what  is  found  in FACT files produced by Release 3A.  Following is a
list of them:

     1.  The FACT entries (e.g., login and logout)  are  out  of  time
         sequence.   Instead  a logout entry follows immediately after
         its login entry.

     2.  There are no  numeric  account  numbers  in  the  FACT  file.
         However,  if an account is numeric, ACCTPR translates it to a
         numeric account just as it always.

     3.  Change account entries are no longer made.  If  CONV20  reads
         in a session entry (USAGE format), a login and logout pair of
         entries are made.

     4.  The console connect time (stored  in  the  fifth  word  of  a
         logout entry) is in seconds now instead of milliseconds.

     5.  Terminal attach and detach entries are not made.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.
