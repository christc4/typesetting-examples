PAT.DOC -- Changes from V3(300) to V3A(306)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

PA1050 version 3A(306) is the TOPS-10 UUO simulator produced from  the
file  PAT.MAC.   It  gets mapped into the address space of any program
that executes a TOPS-10 UUO.  Its function is to intercept all TOPS-10
UUO's and simulate them with the appropriate TOPS-20 JSYS's.

PA1050 version 3A(306) runs under the TOPS-20 Release 3A monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in PA1050 for Release 3A.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

PA1050 is intended to be used to support  only  the  standard  TOPS-20
