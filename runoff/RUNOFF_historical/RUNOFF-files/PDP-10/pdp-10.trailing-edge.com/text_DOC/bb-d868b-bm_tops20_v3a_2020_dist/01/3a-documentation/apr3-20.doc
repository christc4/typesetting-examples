ACCTPR.DOC -- Changes from V2(30) to V3(31)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

ACCTPR translates the binary records in the old System Accounting File
FACT.BIN  to ASCII records which may be processed by report generating
programs written in higher level languages, e.g.  COBOL.

ACCTPR is documented in the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide.

4.1  Files Needed to Run ACCTPR

ACCTPR consists of one file, ACCTPR.EXE

ACCTPR reads  the  binary  records  in  the  System  Accounting  File,
<ACCOUNTS>FACT.BIN.   This  file  is  usually  renamed  to  the user's
directory prior to running ACCTPR.
