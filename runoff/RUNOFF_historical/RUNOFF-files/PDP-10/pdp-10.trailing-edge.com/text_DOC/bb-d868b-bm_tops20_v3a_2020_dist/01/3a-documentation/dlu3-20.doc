DLUSER.DOC -- Version 3(4)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

DLUSER is a program which obtains identifying information  about  each
directory  on  a system and places it in a file.  The program can then
use this file to create the same directories later, in the event of  a
system rebuild.

DLUSER version 3(4) runs only on Release 3A of TOPS-20.

DLUSER does not depend on any other software during its execution.

DLUSER  is  documented  in  the  DECSYSTEM-20  Operator's  Guide   and
