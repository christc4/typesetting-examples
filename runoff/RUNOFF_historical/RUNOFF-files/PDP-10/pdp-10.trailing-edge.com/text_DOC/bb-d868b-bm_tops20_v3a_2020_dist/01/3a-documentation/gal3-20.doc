GALAXY.DOC -- Changes from V2 to V3
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

GALAXY is the Batch and Spooling subsystem for  the  DECsystem-10  and
DECSYSTEM-20.   GALAXY comprises all the software (excluding operating
systems software) necessary to  do  batch  processing  and  input  and
output  spooling and all queue management and task scheduling required
for those functions.

GALAXY Release 3A consists of the following programs:

Program      Version     What it does
-------      -------     ------------

QUASAR          3      Central  queue  manager,  task  scheduler,  and
                       GALAXY system controller.

BATCON         103     Batch job processor.

LPTSPL         103     Lineprinter output spooler (unspooler).

SPRINT         103     Card reader input stacker/spooler.

QUENCH          3      Timesharing  users'  interface  to  the  GALAXY
                       system.

QMANGR         103     Interface module for FOROTS, BASIC, etc.

Release 3A has two primary goals:

     1.  Support  USAGE  file  accounting  for  printer   and   reader
         spooling.

     2.  Provide some hooks for the DN64 project.

In  addition  a  number  of  maintainance  edits  were  merged  in  to
development versions which resolved a number of problems.


1.1  Monitor Dependence

Release 3A of GALAXY will run under the following monitors:

     1.  TOPS20 Release 3A and later
GAL3.DOC                                                        Page 3


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are two major external changes  in  Release  3A  of  the  GALAXY
system.   The  first  is  that the queue manipulation commands (PRINT,
SUBMIT etc.) are now  processed  by  the  EXEC.   This  provides  full
compatibility   with   the  TOPS20  command  language  as  well  as  a
significant improvement  in  response  time  for  these  commands.   A
complete  description  is  provided  in the EXEC DOC file.  The QUENCH
program is still being shipped with GALAXY primarily for compatibility
purposes.  The EXEC also has the

     @SET OLD-QUEUE-COMMANDS
     @SET NEW-QUEUE-COMMANDS

commands added.  Typing the first of the above commands will cause the
PRINT and SUBMIT commands to work as in previous versions.

The other major external change in Release 3A is the addition  of  the
/ACCOUNT switch on the $JOB card.  The format of this switch is:

                       /ACCOUNT:account-string

During $JOB card processing, SPRINT will  verify  the  user's  account
specification.   If  a  /ACCOUNT switch is not found on the $JOB card,
SPRINT  will  look  for  a   default   account   for   the   directory
PS:<user-name>.  If there is no default account for the directory, the
account under which SPRINT itself is running will be used.   The  last
option  is  included  in  order  to let installations phase into using
account strings.  Initially, the system administrator can cause SPRINT
to  be  logged-in  under  a  universally  allowed  account and after a
specific date cause SPRINT to be logged in under a universally illegal
account.

In all cases, SPRINT will verify the account string it decides to  use
(from   any   of  the  three  sources  described  above)  and  if  the
verification fails will produce the following error and abort the job:

     ?SPTIAS Illegal Account Specified

One additional implication of  this  change  to  SPRINT  is  that  the
specified  account  is  now passed on to BATCON and is used to log the
batch job in.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  Any file created by SPRINT or  BATCON  is  created  with  the
         account  string  of  SPRINT  or  BATCON (e.g.  LOG files from
         BATCON, or $CREATE in SPRINT).

     2.  The message %Problem on device PCDR0:  is typed  on  the  CTY
         whenever the hopper goes empty on the card-reader.  It can be
         ignored.

     3.  There is no mechanism for putting parameters (e.g.   /COPIES)
         on spooled files.

     4.  If a batch job does a  "@OPERATOR  $"  (the  dollar  sign  is
         default)  and  the  batch  job  then  enables  itself (or was
         enabled already) then any time the EXEC prompts the job (i.e.
         with a $) the job is put into OPERATOR wait.

     5.  There are two problems which will causes a  job  to  get  the
         error message:

             ?SPTIDP Incorrect Directory or Password

         a)  If the previous job forgets a $EOJ card
         b)  If there is no space following the user name on the $JOB
             card

                                 NOTE

               There are a number of valid reasons  for
               receiving  this  message.   The two most
               common are a  misspelled  user  name  or
               password  and  specifying  a  files-only
               directory instead of a user name.

     6.  If a $JOB card contains a  /JOBNAME  switch  which  does  not
         include  a value (e.g.  $JOB user /JOBNAME) SPRINT will crash
         with the error message

             ?SPTCCC Can't create CTL or LOG File - File Not Found
             ?SPTCCC Can't create CTL or LOG File - File Not Found
             ?PA1050:  ERROR IN JOB
             Invalid source/destination designator
             COMPATIBILITY LOCATION = xxxxxx
             USER LOCATION xxxxxxx
             INSTRUCTION = 57100,,633

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The simplest way of building a GALAXY system is to place all necessary
files  on  an  empty  disk  area,  run  the GALGEN program, and submit
GALAXY.CTL.  There are a number of universal files which are  depended
upon  by  the  various  programs,  and  therefore  attempting to build
individual programs may be difficult.

The System Manager's Guide on the -20 and  the  GALAXY  Operation  and
System  Programming  Procedures  Manual  on the -10 (notebook #3) have
more information on building GALAXY.

Note that the GALAXY "package" contains (and builds) all the necessary
"-20 based" software needed to run the DN64.  See the appropriate DN64
documentation for more information.

Release 3A includes default .EXE files for all GALAXY components.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The following internal changes were made to LPTSPL:

     1.  A bug was fixed which caused LPTSPL to prematurely abort jobs
         with the message

             ?LPTPLE Page Limit Exceeded

         if LPFORM.INI was not found on SYS.

     2.  LPTSPL now makes USAGE file accounting entries.

     3.  A number of maintenance edits were merged in.

The following internal changes were made to SPRINT:

     1.  The account switch was added to the $JOB card.

     2.  SPRINT now makes USAGE file accounting entries.

     3.  SPRINT no longer reads 81 columns per card  if  /SUPPRESS  is
         off

The following changes were made to QUENCH

     1.  The /TAPE switch was re-instated for the PC-20

     2.  Support for the DN64 was added
GAL3.DOC                                                        Page 6


The following changes were made to QUASAR

     1.  A bug was fixed which caused QUASAR to die with the message
             JSYS error -- Invalid access requested 
         if the master queue file became too large.

     2.  Support was added for the DN64

The following change was made to QUENCH

     1.  Support was added for the DN64

The following change was made to BATCON

     1.  If a batch job doesn't logout in a reasonable amount of  time
         after  BATCON  send  the  LOGOUT  command,  BATCON just keeps
         waiting rather than asking the operator for assistance.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
