DUMPER.DOC -- Changes from V3(163) to V3A(172)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

DUMPER is a program for saving and restoring disk files using magtape.
It  is  used  by operations personnel for file system maintenance, and
may be employed by users who wish to keep  certain  files  on  magtape
and/or transfer them between systems.

DUMPER version 3A(172) runs on TOPS-20 Release 3A.

DUMPER does not require any other software modules during execution.

DUMPER is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide, and some  privileged
functions are described in the Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

DUMPER now unloads tapes at end of tape on multi-reel  savesets,  both
on SAVE and RESTORE.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  Reverse SKIPs in interchange mode do not work.

     2.  If there are  any  read  errors  or  duplicate  records,  the
         CHECKSUM feature under the PRINT command is not valid.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run DUMPER

DUMPER.EXE is the only file needed for DUMPER execution.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing DUMPER

DUMPER is loaded in SYS:  as part of the installation procedure.   New
versions may be put into use by copying the DUMPER.EXE file onto SYS:.


4.3  Files Needed for Build DUMPER

DUMPER is built from the following file:
DMR3A.DOC                                                       Page 3


     DUMPER.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACSYM.REL
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building DUMPER

SUBMIT DUMPER.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


4.5  Special Considerations

DUMPER is used during the initial phases of  system  installation  and
file structure refreshing.  For this reason, it is advisable to have a
copy of DUMPER on one or more magtapes.  DUMPER may be put on  magtape
by:

     @ASSIGN MTAn:                      ! assign and mount blank tape
     @REWIND MTAn:                      ! put DUMPER at beginning
     @COPY SYS:DUMPER.EXE (TO) MTAn:    ! copy to tape

DUMPER may be loaded and run directly from a magtape generated in this
way.

DUMPER is intended to perform a number of  privileged  functions  when
run  by  operations  personnel,  and its behavior is modified slightly
when running with WHEEL or  OPERATOR  capabilities  enabled.   Consult
User's and Operator's Guides for additional information.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to DUMPER.TCO for detailed information about changes.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
