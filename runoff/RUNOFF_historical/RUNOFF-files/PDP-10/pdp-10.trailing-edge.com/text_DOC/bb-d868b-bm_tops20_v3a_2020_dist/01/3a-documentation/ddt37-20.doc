DDT.DOC -- Version 37(201)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

DDT is a symbolic assembly language debugger.   DDT  allows  up  to  8
breakpoints  as  well as symbolic patching and manipulation of various
datatypes.

DDT version 37(201) runs on TOPS-20 Release 3A.

DDT does not depend on any other software during DDT execution.

DDT is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes to DDT.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

As of 1-Jan-78 the following restrictions and deficiencies were known:

     1.  RUBOUT, Control-U, and Control-W  are  not  handled  properly
         when  ASCII  or  SIXBIT  text  is input ( " and $" command ).
         Text may be stored in memory even if it was later rubbed out.

     2.  The patching commands ($< and $$<)  do  not  test  for  write
         access  correctly.   Do  not use these commands if the symbol
         table is write protected.

     3.  DDT does not always detect illegal input.

     4.  SDDT has 0 to 17 stored as zero.  This means  that  when  the
         DDT  command  is given to a program with no symbol table, the
         accumlators will all appear to be zero.

                                 NOTE

               DDT is a TOPS-10 program  converted  for
               use on TOPS-20.  It is possible to build
               all the TOPS-10 variations of  DDT  from
               the DDT.MAC file.  Only TOPS-20 versions
               (EDDT=NNN) are supported on TOPS-20.


4.5  Special Considerations

None.
