OPLEAS.DOC -- Changes from V3(11) to V3A(12)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

OPLEAS is the program that enables  the  operator  to  talk  to  users
running  PLEASE.   Requests for contact with the operators are queued;
thus the user can type a request for operator action and know that the
request  will  be  received  even  if  the operator is currently busy.
OPLEAS also handles structure and tape mount  requests  submitted  via
the EXEC TMOUNT and SMOUNT commands.

OPLEAS version 3A(12) runs on TOPS-20 Release 3A.

OPLEAS runs in conjunction with PLEASE version 3(10).

OPLEAS is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.
