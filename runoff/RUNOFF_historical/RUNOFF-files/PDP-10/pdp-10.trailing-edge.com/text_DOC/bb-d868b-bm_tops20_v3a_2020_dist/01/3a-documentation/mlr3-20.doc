MAILER.DOC -- Changes from V2(4) to V3(5)
September 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

MAILER is a privileged system program which, in cooperation with MAIL,
delivers messages to users.  MAILER ordinarily runs under SYSJOB.

MAILER version 3(5) runs only on Release 3A of TOPS-20.

MAILER depends on the program MAIL  3(4)  and  the  privileged  system
program  INFO  3(4).   Messages  delivered  by  MAILER are read by the
program RDMAIL.

MAILER is not formally documented.
