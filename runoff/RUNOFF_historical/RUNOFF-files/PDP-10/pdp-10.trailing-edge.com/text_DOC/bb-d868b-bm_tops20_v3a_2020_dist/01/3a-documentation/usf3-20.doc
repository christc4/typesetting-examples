1.0  SUMMARY

USAH20 is a general purpose downstream billing program with Category C
support.   It  uses  the new USAGE file format (see DECSYSTEM-20 USAGE
File Specification for a complete description) as input and  optionall
outputs four reports.  These are:

     1.  System usage sorted by user name.

     2.  System usage sorted by account.

     3.  Disk usage sorted by directory name.

     4.  Disk usage sorted by account.

Read USAH20.HLP for instructions on running this program.

The released version of USAH20.EXE does not depend  on  any  software.
Hovever,  if  you wish to recompile this program, FORTRAN V5A and SORT
V3A will be needed.
