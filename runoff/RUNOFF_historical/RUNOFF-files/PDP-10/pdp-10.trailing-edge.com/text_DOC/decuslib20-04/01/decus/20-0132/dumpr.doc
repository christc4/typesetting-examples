DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 1


     DUMPR  is  a  utility  program  to  dump  arbitrary  files   in   a
human-readable  format.   Input  to  DUMPR  is  a  file on any supported
device:  disk, magnetic tape, DECtape.  Output is in ascii mode  to  the
specified output device.

     General command format:

          ODEV:OFILE.EXT[P,PN]/SWITCHS=IDEV:IFILE.EXT[P,PN]/SWITCHS

     Allowable switches are:

     1.  /BACKSP:F:R
         Backspaces  magtapes  f  files  and   r   records.    /BACKSP:R
         backspaces  r  records  or  blocks  on  a  directory  device or
         magtape.

     2.  /BLOCK:N
         Set the record size (characters/record) to n for EBCDIC dumps.

     3.  /BUFSIZ:N
         Set the input buffer size to n words.  The default buffer  size
         is 1024(10) words for magtape and disk files read with /FORTRAN
         or /IREAD.

     4.  /DENSITY:ARG
         Sets the magtape density to one of:  200,  556,  800,  or  1600
         bpi.  (Defaults are:  7 track-800 bpi, 9 track-1600 bpi.)

     5.  /DUMP:F:R
         Dumps f files and r records from magtape or r blocks or records
         from  a  directory  device  or magtape.  /DUMP is an input-only
         switch.

     6.  /FORTRAN
         The input file is in FORTRAN binary mode.  This is  created  by
         using  FORTRAN  binary  write  statements.   This will not dump
         FORTRAN random binary files.

     7.  /ERROR:ARG
         Specify the action to take when an input error occurs:

         1.  CONTIN
             Continue processing after reporting the error.

         2.  IGNORE
             Do not report the error.

         3.  QUERY
             Report the error and ask  for  an  option  from  the  user.
             Legal responses are:

             1.  C - continue
DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 2


             2.  H - Give some help.

             3.  I - make /ERROR:QUERY into /ERROR:IGNORE.

             4.  Q - quit dumping and return to command mode.

             5.  S - Skip this record and proceed.



     8.  /HELP
         Give some help.

     9.  /IFTYP
         Enable  for  command  type-in  while  the  dump   is   running.
         Allowable commands are:

         1.  I - Ignore all further typein (disable /IFTYP).

         2.  K - Kill the dump.   Output  files  are  closed  and  DUMPR
             prompts for another command.

         3.  P - Pause.  Processing will continue when any character  is
             typed on the teletype.


    10.  /INDUSTRY
         Read the  magnetic  tape  in  industry-compatible  mode.   This
         consists  of  four (4) eight-bit bytes packed in the high order
         32 bits of a DEC-10 word.  The low order 4 bits are zero.  When
         this mode is used, the dump will dump the high order 32 bits of
         data as if it was a 32-bit word.

    11.  /IREAD
         Dump the file in IREAD mode.  On magtape,  IREAD  mode  implies
         each  logical  record is a physical record.  On disk, the first
         word is a word count, followed by that many words.  This switch
         depends on FT$PHX being on at assembly time (default).

    12.  /LINRDX:ARG
         Print line numbers (word counts) in  radix  specified  by  ARG.
         Allowable values for ARG are:

         1.  DECIMAL
             Base 10.  (default) Line numbers will start at one.

         2.  HEX
             Base 16.  Line numbers will start at zero.

         3.  OCTAL
             Base 8.  Line numbers will start at zero.

DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 3


    13.  /MODE:ARG
         Output the dump in the format specified by  ARG.   This  switch
         may appear on the output side only.  Legal values for ARG are:

         1.  ASCII
             Dump the file in ASCII mode.  If  /INDUSTRY  is  used,  the
             file is dumped in eight-bit ASCII mode.

         2.  BYTE:N
             dump the file as bytes of size n (1 le n le 36).  

         3.  EBCDIC
             Dump the file in ebcdic format.  (use only with /INDUSTRY)

         4.  FLOAT
             Dump the file as  floating  point  numbers.   The  file  is
             dumped  as DEC10 floating point numbers unless /INDUSTRY is
             used, in which case the numbers are dumped as  IBM  360/370
             floating point numbers.

         5.  HALF
             Dump the file in halfword format.  This consists of  18-bit
             bytes in normal mode, and 16-bit bytes in Industry mode.

         6.  HEX
             Dump the file in hexadecimal (base 16).  

         7.  INTEGER
             Dump the file as integers (base 10).

         8.  OCTAL
             Dump the file in octal (default).

         9.  SIXBIT
             Dump the file in sixbit mode.  (unusable with /INDUSTRY)

        10.  SYMBOL
             Dump the file in PDP-10 instruction format.


    14.  /MTBUF:N
         Specify  the  number  of  buffers  to  use  for  magtape  input
         (default=2).

    15.  /NORETRY
         Set no read retries on errors (magtape only).

    16.  /OMIT
         Omit the line numbers.

    17.  /ONLY:L:H
         Only dump from words l to h of each record.  to dump words 1 to
         n use /ONLY:N.  This switch is input-only.
DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 4


    18.  /PARITY:ARG
         Sets the parity for magtape to EVEN or ODD.

    19.  /POSITION
         Use of this switch allows you to do magtape positioning only in
         a DUMPR command.  For instance, the command:

                   MTA3:/P/REW/SKIP:3:20

         would rewind MTA3:  and then skip 3 files and 20 records.  This
         switch  may  only  be  used  with  magtape,  and the only legal
         positioning switches are /BACKSP, /REWIND, and /SKIP.

    20.  /RADIX:N
         Output dump in radix n.  (Effective only  if  no  /MODE  switch
         specified) Legal values for N are 2-16.

    21.  /REWIND
         Rewinds the magtape before dumping.

    22.  /RIB
         On disk file dumps without /IREAD  or  /FORTRAN,  position  the
         file to dump the rib (retrieval information block).  Illegal on
         MTA and DTA.

    23.  /SKIP:F:R
         Skip forward f files and r records on side that switch  appears
         on.  /SKIP:R skips r records or blocks on a directory device.

    24.  /SUMMARY
         Print only one line per record (or block) with a final  summary
         at the end.

    25.  /TITLE:"STRING-NO-DOUBLE-QUOTES"
         Places the string in quotes at the top of the dump.

    26.  /TOTALS
         List only the totals for each file;  do not output  any  record
         summaries.

    27.  /WIDTH:N
         Set the width of the dump to  N.   Default  is  132.   for  all
         devices  except  the terminal (default=80.).  If the dump is to
         the terminal and no /WIDTH is specified, DUMPR will attempt  to
         read  the terminal width setting from the monitor and use that,
         or will use the default if unable to read it.

                             COMMAND NOTES

     1.  The default input specification is DSK:DUMPIT.DAT.  The default
         output specification is LPT:DUMPED.LPT.

     2.  If /NORETRY is specified and there are input errors, the record
         is dumped and processing continues.

     3.  If /NORETRY is not specified and input errors are  encountered,
         the  error  is  reported,  the record is dumped, and processing
         continues.

     4.  If /OMIT is specified, there is no formatting done for ASCII or
         EBCDIC dumps.

     5.  Some switches are executed in the order they are  seen  in  the
         input command string:  /BACKSP, /DUMP,/rewind, and /SKIP.

     6.  /MODE sets the mode for the next /DUMP switch.  /ONLY sets  the
         limits  for  the  next /DUMP switch.  To turn off /ONLY once it
         has been set in a dump, use /ONLY with no arguments.

     7.  It is possible to do multiple dumps with one command:

                   LPT:=DEV:FILE.EXT/ONLY:5/DUMP:6/SKIP:4/ONLY/DUMP:10

              This command will dump the first  five  words  of  records
         (blocks)  1-6, skip the next 4 records (blocks), and completely
         dump the next 10 records (blocks).

     8.  If no /DUMP switch is specified the whole input file (or  whole
         magtape) is dumped.

     9.  DUMPR will scan SWITCH.INI for applicable switches.   Allowable
         switches  are:   /BUFSIZ,  /ERROR, /IFTYP, /LINRDX, /MTBUF, and
         /WIDTH.  See  DOC:COPYMT.DOC  for  a  complete  description  of
         SWITCH.INI.

    10.  If the feature test switch FT$WLD is set non-zero  at  assembly
         time  (default),  the  input  file  specification  may  contain
         wild-carding.   The  limit  of  one  specification   is   still
         enforced.   If the dump is to a spooled device (LPT) there will
         be a separate  output  file  for  each  input  file  processed.
         Switches  given  will be applied to each file which matches the
         input specifications.

                             DUMPR messages

     DUMPR issues three classes of messages.  These are error,  warning,
and  informative  messages.   Following  is a list of the messages and a
short description of each.

ERROR MESSAGES (usually fatal):

     1.  ?DMPBRB /BYTE REQUIRES BYTESIZE
         The /MODE:BYTE switch requires a byte size.  Retype the command
         properly.

     2.  ?DMPBSO CANT BACKSPACE DISK OUTPUT
         You have tried to position the disk output file with a  /BACKSP
         switch.

     3.  ?DMPCDM CANT DUMP MULTIPLE FILES ON DIRECTORY DEVICE
         You have specifed /DUMP:F:R with a disk input  file.   You  may
         only specify /DUMP:R on a disk device.

     4.  ?DMPCGH CAN'T GET HIGH SEGMENT, CODE = N
         This message is not expected to occur.  If  it  does,  see  the
         maintainer.

     5.  ?DMPCOD CAN'T OPEN DEVICE, FILE DEV:FILE.EXT
         DUMPR was unable to open the specified device.

     6.  ?DMPCRD CANNOT REWIND DISK OUTPUT
         You have specified /REWIND on the output side  and  the  output
         device is a disk.

     7.  ?DMPCUS CANT USE SAME MAGTAPE FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT - MTAX
         You have tried to use the same magtape for  input  and  output.
         This does not work.

     8.  ?DMPEIW EBCDIC ILLEGAL WITHOUT /INDUSTRY
         You have specified /MODE:EBCDIC  without  /INDUSTRY.   This  is
         illegal.

     9.  ?DMPEBE EOF BEFORE END OF IREAD RECORD
         This means that either the file was not in IREAD format, or the
         IREAD format for the file is incorrect.

    10.  ?DMPIAR ILLEGAL ARGUMENT FOR /RADIX - N
         THE RANGE OF ARGUMENTS FOR /RADIX IS 2-16.

    11.  ?DMPIBS ILLEGAL BYTE SIZE - N
         The legal range of byte sizes is 2-36.  Any number out of  this
         range is illegal.

    12.  ?DMPID7 ILLEGAL DENSITY FOR 7-TRACK
         You have specified /DENSITY:1600 or /DENSITY:6250 on a  7-track
         tape  unit.  The only legal 7-track densities are 200, 556, and
         800 bpi.
DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 7


    13.  ?DMPID9 ILLEGAL DENSITY FOR 9-TRACK
         You have specified an illegal density for 9-track  tapes  (200,
         or 556 bpi).

    14.  ?DMPIDV ILLEGAL DEVICE DEV
         You have specified either an unknown device or  a  device  that
         DUMPR was not designed to handle.

    15.  DMPIOE I/O ERROR - STATUS=N (XXX), FILE DEV:FILE.EXT
         An I/O error has occurred on the device.

    16.  ?DMPIFF INCORRECTLY FORMATTED FORTRAN FILE
         The input file is not really in FORTRAN binary mode.

    17.  ?DMPIFU IREAD FILE MESSED UP
         DUMPR has encountered an IREAD word count which was non-zero in
         the  left  half  (disk  only).  This usually means the file was
         improperly written, or it is not an IREAD file.

    18.  ?DMPISO INPUT SWITCH ILLEGAL ON OUTPUT - SWITCHNAME
         You have specified an input-only switch on the output  side  of
         the command.

    19.  ?DMPLER LOOKUP/ENTER ERROR(N) FILE DEV:FILE.EXT[P,PN]
         The specified lookup/enter error has occurred.  See the monitor
         calls manual for a description of the error codes.

    20.  ?DMPMIS MULTIPLE INPUT SPECIFICATIONS ILLEGAL
         DUMPR only handles one input file specification.

    21.  ?DMPMOF MULTIPLE OUTPUT FILES ILLEGAL
         You may only specify one output file.

    22.  ?DMPMSE MODE SPECIFICATION ERROR - /IREAD + /FORTRAN
         An input file may not be in IREAD and FORTRAN form at the  same
         time.

    23.  ?DMPODF OUTPUT DEVICE FULL
         You have exceeded your disk quota, or  the  output  DECTAPE  or
         magtape is full.

    24.  ?DMPOIS /ONLY INCORRECTLY SPECIFIED
         Either one or the other arguments was negative, or  the  second
         argument was greater than the first argument.

    25.  ?DMPOSI OUTPUT SWITCH ILLEGAL ON INPUT - SWITCHNAME
         The named switch is an output-only switch and was found on  the
         input specification.

    26.  ?DMPRIB /RIB ILLEGAL ON OUTPUT OR ILLEGAL DEVICE FOR /RIB
         /RIB is legal only on disk input files.

    27.  ?DMPSFI SKIP/BACKSPACE FILES ILLEGAL ON DIRECTORY DEVICE
         Need I say more?
DUMPR -- UTILITY FILE DUMPER %5                                   Page 8


    28.  ?DMPSFM CANNOT BACKSPACE MTA WITH /FORTRA
         Since this is so rarely  done,  it  was  not  coded.   See  the
         maintainer if this is a problem.

    29.  ?DMPSWE SWITCH ERROR - /SUMMARY + /TOTALS
         You may not specify /SUMMARY and /TOTALS in the same command.

    30.  ?DMPSWI SIXBIT WITH /INDUSTRY ILLEGAL
         This makes no sense.

    31.  ?DMPWFI WILDCARD FILESPEC ILLEGAL, FILE DEV:FILE.EXT
         DUMPR does not  support  wild-carding.   (however,  DUMPR  does
         support input wild-carding.  see command notes)


WARNING MESSAGES (PROCESSING CONTINUES):

     1.  %DMPIND /INDUSTRY NO-OP ON NON-MTA DEVICE
         You have specified /INDUSTRY on a device that is not a magtape.
         The switch is ignored.

     2.  %DMPRTL RECORD TOO LARGE - N - FILE F RECORD R
         DUMPR has encountered a record of size n in file f,  record  r.
         This  message will only occur on disk files read with /IREAD or
         /FORTRA.  The problem may  be  alleviated  by  using  a  larger
         /BUFSIZ.

     3.  %DMPTUF TAPOP.  UUO FAILURE--CODE = N
         A tapop.  monitor call has failed.  This  is  not  expected  to
         occur.  See the maintainer.


INFORMATIVE MESSAGES:

     1.  [DMPPTC PAUSING--TYPE ANY CHARACTER TO CONTINUE]
         DUMPR is pausing in response to a "p" typed  in  while  running
         and  /IFTYP specified in the command.  Any character typed will
         resume operation.

     2.  [DMPIPT INITIAL POSITION OF TAPE IS FILE N RECORD M]
         This message will only appear at the top  of  dumps  done  from
         magnetic  tapes.  DUMPR is showing you the position of the tape
         as it was obtained from the Monitor.
