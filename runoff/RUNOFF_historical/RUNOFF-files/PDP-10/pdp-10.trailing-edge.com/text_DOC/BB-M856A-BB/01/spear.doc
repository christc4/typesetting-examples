SPEAR.DOC -- V1(36)
JUNE 1982





1.0  SUMMARY

SPEAR is a package of programs which  enable  the  field  service  and
operations  staff  to quickly isolate and correct problem areas in the
system hardware or software.  The SPEAR package  contains  a  computer
aided  instruction  (CAI)  program  called  INSTRUCT.  This program in
conjunction with the SPEAR manual  will  allow  anyone  interested  in
using  the  package  to  learn  at  his own pace, without depending on
anyone else.

SPEAR version 1(36) is written in BLISS and operates in native mode on
TOPS-10 version 7.01.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  Version 1(36) is the first release of SPEAR for TOPS-10.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

3.1  Bugs

     1.  Drive Timing Errors are summarized as  unsafes  in  the  disk
         error  summary.   This  is  incorrect, as they do not set the
         Unsafe bit in error register 1.  The  theory  about  DTEs  is
         unaffected by this bug.

     2.  In the SUMMARIZE outputs, the serial  numbers  for  TU71  and
         TU72  tape  drives  are  output in hex instead of in decimal.
         All other SPEAR functions output them in decimal.

     3.  The MEAN RUN TIME in the COMPUT.RPT may be  incorrect.   This
         will not affect the system availability figures.

     4.  COMPUT.RPT sometimes gives incorrect reload totals under  the
         monitor name headers.

     5.  The Front End CD20 reports contain incorrect values  for  the
         four  device  registers.  This causes the translation for the
         CD11ST register to  be  incorrect.   The  CD20  configuration
         report is also incorrect.
SPR1.DOC                                                        Page 3


     6.  RETRIEVE  transposes  TU70  and  TU71  drive  types  in  DX20
         reports, identifying a TU70 as a TU71 and vice versa.




3.2  Restrictions

     1.  Some numeric values in various output reports are limited  to
         a  specific  field  width.  When this field width is exceeded
         (i.e.  the value is too large for the field), the field  will
         be filled with asterisks.

     2.  When the event file has too many entries, ANALYZE will give a
         dynamic memory allocation error of the type:

              ? dynamic memory allocation error
              -    insufficient dynamic memory

         One of the SUMMARIZE outputs is a  table  which  enables  the
         user  to see the number of entries broken down by major class
         and the hour of the day.  If  ANALYZE  runs  out  of  dynamic
         memory,  you  can  use  this  summary  output  to adjust your
         analysis time frame to a smaller window.

     3.  SPEAR currently uses SCAN to translate  user-specified  dates
         and times.  This means that some special features of SCAN are
         available (TODAY, YESTERDAY, etc.).  These features  are  not
         guaranteed  to  work  correctly nor will they remain in SPEAR
         forever.  For this reason, they are  not  documented  in  the
         SPEAR manual.

     4.  When two users are running SPEAR  from  the  same  directory,
         there  is  a low probability of their temporary command files
         becoming confused.  This situation should be avoided.

     5.  There is a probability of version skew messages appearing  if
         a  monitor update with a different basic SPEAR version is put
         up after installation of the extended package.   This  should
         be ignored as it does not affect the running of SPEAR.




3.2.1  Minimum Core Requirements - All SPEAR programs grow to meet the
demands  of the data file.  Since it was expected that SPEAR would run
on virtual machines only, no effort went into meeting any core limits.
This was in the project plan.

The following will give you some idea of how  much  core  (virtual  or
physical)  is  required  to  run SPEAR on TOPS-10.  The numbers are in
pages.
                                                          *  ESTIMATED
FUNCTION  |  SPEAR   |  SYSERR  *   SPEAR    |   SYSERR   *    SPEAR
          | AT START | AT START * DURING RUN | DURING RUN * REQUIREMENTS
SPR1.DOC                                                        Page 4


----------|----------|----------*------------|------------*-------------
Retrieve  |   156    |    66    *    172     |    152     *    250
Summarize |    72    |    66    *    108     |    152     *    200
Compute   |    64    |    76    *     70     |     88     *    150
----------|----------|----------*------------|------------*-------------
Analyze   |   128    |    --    *    252     |    ---     *    512
Instruct  |   311    |    --    *    311     |    ---     *    311

This  means  that a system running basic SPEAR needs 250 pages of user
memory available.   A  system  running  full  SPEAR  needs  512  pages
available.  Again these numbers are based on a test of one week's data
(with many entries).

Since Analyze has been known to run out of virtual memory, we know  it
needs the full amount.

4.3  Loading And Installing The SPEAR Package

Define the area where you want the files to go as  SRC:   through  the
PATH command and then do the following:

Mount the distribution tape for Backup and then run  BACKUP  with  the
following commands:

     R BACKUP
     /TAPE (logical tape name)
     /REW
     /FILES
     /INTERCHANGE
     /RESTORE SRC:*.*=*.*
     /EXIT
     .K




4.4  Special Considerations

All the files listed in section 4.2 must exist in the  same  directory
for SPEAR to operate properly.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

SPEAR VERSION 1(36) is the first release for TOPS-10.
SPR1.DOC                                                        Page 6


6.0  SUGGESTIONS

The suggested method of using this  product  is  to  run  the  ANALYZE
function  on  a  weekly  basis  against the error file of the previous
week, and supplement this report with  daily  runs  for  the  last  24
hours.   See  DAIL10.CTL,  and  WEEK10.CTL for examples of the control
files to do the daily and weekly runs automatically.

ANALYZE has to assume  that  the  system  has  been  maintained  in  a
'standard  fashion'.   If  you  forgEt  to reformat disk packs after a
realignment of the drive, you can  expect  ANALYZE  to  generate  many
different "theories" on the read errors that will occur.

This release of SPEAR does not analyze above the  "unit"  level.   You
might see ANALYZE indicting two or three units on one controller when,
in fact, the controller is at fault.

Since the ANALYZE function is new, SPEAR keeps pointers to each  error
file entry used to produce a conclusive statement.  These pointers are
kept in a "packet file" which is one of the outputs  of  ANALYZE.   If
you  don't  believe  that a conclusive statement is accurate or if you
think you have a better theory, you can specify this  packet  file  as
input  to  RETRIEVE, and get the same detailed (or brief) entry report
you got from SYSERR.
