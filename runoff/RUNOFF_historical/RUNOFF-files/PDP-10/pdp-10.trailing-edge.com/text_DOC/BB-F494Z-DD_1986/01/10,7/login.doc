1.0  SUMMARY

This is a development release of LOGIN.  New switches have been added to
support  new  7.03  features  and extensive work was done to support the
changes required by the 7.03 accounting project.  This version of  LOGIN
has  been  tested  under 7.02, 7.02A, and 7.03 monitors running the 7.03
accounting system, and fully supersedes all previous versions.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are several changes that have no impact on the user interface, but
do  affect programs that interface to LOGIN or the accounting files used
by LOGIN.  There are also a number of changes to the user interface.



2.1  Access To The Accounting Files

LOGIN no longer reads the accounting files to retrieve a user's  profile
or  search list data.  Accounting file I/O is all done by the accounting
daemon (ACTDAE).  Therefore, ACTDAE must be running before LOGIN  allows
access  to the system.  One exception is when /BYPASS is appended to the
ATTACH or LOGIN command line.  This is described later in this document.



2.2  FACT File Support

FACT file support has been completely removed from LOGIN.



2.3  LOGIN's Use Of TRMOP. UUO Function .TOFLM

LOGIN takes advantage of the a new 7.03  TRMOP. UUO  function  to  force
left  margin.   It  no  longer attempts to keep track of the horrizontal
cursor position to determine when to output  a  carriage-return.   Under
7.02,  LOGIN  may  output  an  extra  carriage-return  before  verbosity
controlled messages  (%LGNxxx ...)  or  before  typing  system  messages
(NOTICE.TXT, STR.TXT, etc.).



2.4  Prompting For Password(s) And Name

Although the practice is storngly discouraged, LOGIN has always  allowed
a  user  to  append  the  password to the end of the LOGIN command line.
This caused problems for PPNs where a name is required because the  name
prompt  preceeded  the  password  prompt.   LOGIN  now  prompts  for the
password(s) before the name.
LOGIN -- DECsystem-10 access program version 64 -- January 1985   Page 3


2.5  Required Names

If the logging-in PPN was created without a user name as the result of a
multiple-PPN  insert  (i.e.   REACT  command  INSERT [10,*]), LOGIN will
prompt the user for a name and cause that name to be  entered  into  the
accounting system.



2.6  Required Passwords

With the advent of the  /BYPASS  switch  (described  elsewhere  in  this
document),  LOGIN  no longer requires a password to be typed if LOGIN is
running on one of the CPU's CTYs.



2.7  Required Password Changes

If the system administrator invalidates passwords, LOGIN will inform the
user  that a password change is required.  The user is then prompted for
a new password as if /PASSWORD had been typed.



2.8  SWITCH.INI Option Scanning

LOGIN reads SWITCH.INI on all commands that run LOGIN.



2.9  ATTACH Command

The ATTACH command will accept a user name in place of a  PPN.   A  user
name cannot be used in conjunction with /BYPASS.


The monitor runs LOGIN (in an alternate context) on any  ATTACH  command
which  it  does  not  recognize.   This behavior allows commands such as
.ATTACH /HELP to work.  If no arguments are typed on the ATTACH command,
LOGIN  will  prompt with "#" and wait for the user to type a job number,
PPN, or user name.  ATTACH username may not be used by a privileged  job
(i.e.  [1,2]).  This is a monitor restriction.


Only enough information necessary to uniquely identify  the  target  job
must  be  specified  on  an  ATTACH  command  (i.e.   a  job number will
suffice).  If a user types .ATTACH [ppn] or  .ATTACH username  and  more
than  one detached job exists, LOGIN will query the user for the desired
job number.

2.10  LOGIN Command

The LOGIN command will accept a user name in place of  a  PPN.   A  user
name cannot be used in conjunction with /BYPASS.



2.11  PASSWORD Command

LOGIN may be invoked by a PASSWORD command to allow a user to request  a
password change without going through the LOGIN process.  First the user
will be asked to enter the current password.  Once  this  is  done,  the
user will be prompted for a new password and to verify that password.



2.12  REATTACH Command

The REATTACH command runs LOGIN  and  performs  the  same  functionality
available in the old REATTA program, which has been unsupported for some
time now.  If a user types a REATTACH command with  no  argument,  LOGIN
will prompt for a new terminal name.



2.13  SESSION Command

In previous versions of LOGIN, the  SESSION  command  accepted  switches
from  the  LOGIN  line in SWITCH.INI.  Now, the SESSION command has it's
own switch table and will only accept switches from the SESSION line  in
SWITCH.INI.



2.14  Old-style Default Switches

The /DEFAULT switch fully supersedes  the  old-style  default  switches.
These  old  switches  have  been feature tested and normally turned off.
They may be turned on by setting OLDDEF to 1.  The  switches  under  the
OLDDEF conditional will be removed in the next release of LOGIN.



2.15  Old-style Terminal Switches

The /TERMINAL switch fully supersedes the old-style  terminal  switches.
These  old  switches  have  been feature tested and normally turned off.
They may be turned on by setting OLDTTY to 1.  The  switches  under  the
OLDTTY conditional will be removed in the next release of LOGIN.

2.16  /BYPASS Switch

This switch enables a privileged terminal bypass the  accounting  system
on ATTACH or LOGIN commands.  This functionality is useful for ATTACHing
to the accounting daemon if it is halted  or  hung.   /BYPASS  is  valid
under the following conditions:

     1.   /BYPASS is typed on any CTY (remote CTYs excluded)

     2.   /BYPASS is typed on OPR:

     3.   /BYPASS is typed on a subjob of a [1,2] job

     4.   /BYPASS is typed on a local terminal

     5.   /BYPASS is typed on any terminal and sched 10 is in effect




2.17  /HELP Switch

When a /HELP switch is  given,  LOGIN  will  type  the  help  file  that
corresponds  to the invoking command name (i.e.  LOGIN.HLP for the LOGIN
command, SESSIO.HLP for the SESSION command, etc.).



2.18  /MAILCHECK Switch

LOGIN supports mail checking  for  MS,  the  DECsystem-10  mailer.   The
default is to do mail checking for all users.  Normally, LOGIN will look
for DSK:MAIL.TXT[,]/PHYSICAL.   For  sites  using  a  non-standard  mail
system, the symbols MAILDV, MAILFN, MAILEX, and MAILPP (the mail device,
file, extension, and PPN respectively) may be  redefined  as  necessary.
Unlike  previous versions, LOGIN now checks for mail on ATTACH commands.
The /MAILCHECK switch is legal on  ATTACH  commands  and  on  SWITCH.INI
lines begining with ATTACH.



2.19  /PASSWORD Switch

A user may request a password change by appending /PASSWORD to the LOGIN
command  line.   When  this  switch  is given, immediately following the
"Password:" prompt, the user will be prompted for  a  new  password  and
then  asked  to  verify that password.  The new password will become the
permanent password after a sucessful LOGIN.

2.20  New /TERMINAL Switch Options

There are several new keywords for the /TERMINAL switch.  Most of  these
were added to support 8-bit ASCII terminal.



2.20.1  ECHO - In accordance with changes made to the monitor, the  ECHO
option no longer sets the terminal's local copy status.  Instead it sets
the echo status at command level.  This option takes the  standard  SCAN
arguments  of  OFF/ON,  NO/YES,  and 0/1 keywords with the default being
"YES".



2.20.2  EIGHTBIT - A user may set  the  8-bit  terminal  I/O  status  by
including  the  EIGHTBIT  keyword.   This option takes the standard SCAN
arguments of OFF/ON, NO/YES, and 0/1 keywords  with  the  default  being
"YES".



2.20.3  ESCAPE - A user may set the <ESCAPE>  translation  character  by
including  the ESCAPE keyword.  Valid arguments are an octal number or a
quoted character with the default being 033  (<ESCAPE>).   This  feature
allows  the  character in question to be translated into an <ESCAPE> and
is useful with many of the new  keyboards  now  available  that  do  not
contain <ESCAPE> keys where people expect them to be.



2.20.4  LOCALCOPY - In accordance with changes made to the monitor,  the
LOCALCOPY option was added to set the local copy status of the terminal.
Previous versions of LOGIN used the ECHO option for this purpose.   This
option  takes  the  standard  SCAN  arguments of OFF/ON, NO/YES, and 0/1
keywords with the default being "YES".



2.20.5  QUOTE - A user may  enable  or  disable  the  character  quoting
features  of  the  monitor by including the QUOTE keyword.  This feature
toggles the effect Control-V has on the "next"  character  typed.   This
option  takes  the  standard  SCAN  arguments of OFF/ON, NO/YES, and 0/1
keywords with the default being "YES".



2.20.6  UNPAUSE - A user may set  the  <XON>  translation  character  by
including the UNPAUSE keyword.  Valid arguments are an octal number or a
quoted character with the  default  being  021  (<XON>).   This  feature
allows  the  character in question to be translated into an <XON> and is
used primarily when hosting across non-ANF10 network connections.

2.21  Known Bugs And Deficiencies

If a user Control-C's out LOGIN while waiting for a  response  from  the
accounting  daemon,  disk usage will be recomputed on the next sucessful
LOGIN.



3.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

LOGIN searches ACTSYM, JOBDAT, MACTEN, SCNMAC, UFDPRM, and  UUOSYM.   It
loads with HELPER, SCAN, UFDSET, and WILD.



4.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to the revision history in LOGIN.MAC.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

Add a switch /MIC:"stuff" like /TMPFIL:MIC:"DO stuff"/RUN:MIC/RUNOFF.
