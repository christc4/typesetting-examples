1.0  SUMMARY

MACSYM is a file containing macro definitions which the TOPS10 monitor
and  some  DIGITAL-supplied cusps use.  This is a collection of macros
which the combined TOPS10 and TOPS20 monitor groups find usefull,  and
as such are subject to change without notice.  This current version is
actually the TOPS20 monitor MACSYM which is being used for Release 6.1
of  the  TOPS20 monitor, and as such contains much which is irrelevant
on TOPS10.
