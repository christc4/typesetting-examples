SOUP.DOC -- Changes from V2B to V3
October 1971



1.0  SUMMARY

This release adds a new  switch  in  FED  (to  produce  a  SRCCOM-like
listing  of  the  changes made during an update), and corrects several
old bugs.  Also the version number and JOBDAT symbols are  changed  so
as to conform to the system standard.

This version of SOUP (CAM, FED, and COMP10)  supersedes  all  previous
versions and runs on all monitors.

SOUP is documented in Software Notebook 6.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  FED /X Switch

If a list file device is specified in the FED command string, and  the
/X switch is included, a listing is made for each file updated showing
the changes made in this update.  Both the lines deleted and the lines
added  are  shown  and  clearly  marked.   Line  and  page numbers are
included.

Example:  .R FED
         *DSK:,DSK:_DTA0:,PTR:/X

If the list file device is specified but /X is  not  included  in  the
command  string,  FED continues to produce a listing of the entire new
file as it did in earlier versions.

2.2  Defaults

The default device name "DSK:" is now assumed except where to omit  it
would  imply a null field in the command string.  Thus, if a file-name
or proj-prog number is given, "DSK:" may be omitted.

Example:  .R CAM
         *SOUP.COR_[12,141],DSK:

The default list-file extension is now ".LST" instead of inserting "L"
for one of the letters of the extension.

2.3  Line-Sequence-Numbers

LINE-SEQUENCE-NUMBERS as produced by several editors and by  PIP  with
/S  are  correctly  passed  by CAM, FED and COMP10.  Also, if present,
these numbers are used in the listings produced by FED instead of  the
SOUP-generated numbers.

2.4  Type-Ahead

You may now type ahead to CAM, FED and COMP10.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Identical entries in two correction files should  not  be  a  conflict
when merging.

/P switch ignored by CAM on first command string fetched from  command
file.

Does not detect torn paper tape.

FED does not handle insertion header from CDR:  because  it  does  not
ignore trailing blanks.

Some error messages do not have question marks preceding them.

CAM  in  multi-file  mode   does   not   properly   handle   different
file-structures.  E.G., if DSKA:  is specifed CAM uses DSK:.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Version number in new format and JOBDAT symbols changed.
