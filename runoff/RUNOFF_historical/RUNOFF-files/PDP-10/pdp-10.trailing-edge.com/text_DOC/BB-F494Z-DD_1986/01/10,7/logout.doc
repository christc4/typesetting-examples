1.0  SUMMARY

GALAXY LOGOUT version 103 runs on all monitors.  It  has  been  tested
under  the  7.02,  7.02A,  and  7.03 monitors.  This version of LOGOUT
fully supersedes all previous versions.  LOGOUT is documented  in  the
TOPS-10 Operating System Commands Manual under the KJOB command.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

LOGOUT now supports  SWITCH.INI  and  uses  SCAN  to  do  its  command
scanning.  All legal SCAN command constructs and calling sequences are
supported.  This includes the use of an indirect command file  on  the
invoking  command line, TMP file support when started at the CCL entry
point,  etc.   All  applicable  "standard"  SCAN  switches  are   also
recognized.

LOGOUT now uses UFDSET  for  UFD  manipulation  and  recomputing  disk
usage.

LOGOUT implements a switch to cause a line to  be  disconnected.   The
new  switch is /DISCONNECT.  It takes no arguments and may be appended
to a normal KJOB command line.

LOGOUT  keys  off  the  Asynchronous  Port  Characteristic  codes   to
determine   which  types  of  terminal  lines  will  automatically  be
disconnected.   By  default,  NRT,   CTERM,   and   LAT   lines   will
automatically disconnect when LOGOUT terminates.  This behavior may be
altered by changing the APC arguments to the DISC macro.

LOGOUT will set the  user's  path  to  the  UFD  just  after  deleting
temporary  files.   This  increases  the chances of the batch deletion
algorithm sucessfully deleting SFDs.
