SCDSET.DOC -- Changes from V4(13) to V5(15)
February 1985



1.0  SUMMARY

SCDSET V5(15) has been modified to support functions 31 and 32 of  the
SCHED.   UUO.   These  functions provide the system administrator with
subtaintially greater control over swapping activity  on  the  system.
Function 31 allows the system administrator to vary the length of time
a high segment which becomes dormant will be retained in  core  before
being  deleted  by the swapper.  Increasing this value will in general
decrease lost time on a system where substaintail GETSEG activity goes
on.   E., g.  a system where FORTRAN application development is a very
major activity -  the FORTRAN compiler and LINK are both  multisegment
programs.   Function  32  allows  the system administrator to set free
core goals for the swapper.  This will reduce swapping  loads  on  any
system  where  there  appear  to  be  many  long  term  waiters in the
schedular queues, but still swapped in.  SCDSET  reads  and  sets  the
scheduler parameters.

SCDSET runs with all  supported  monitors  and  fully  supersedes  all
previous versions.

For further information, see the file SCDSET.MEM.
