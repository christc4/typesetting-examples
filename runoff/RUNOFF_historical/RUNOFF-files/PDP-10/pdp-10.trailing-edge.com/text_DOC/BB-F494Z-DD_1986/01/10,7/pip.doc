534    357 broke /W, 531 broke /C.  Fix them both  by  re-implementing
       code  from 357, and clearing the "TAB SEEN" flag after the LSN,
       instead of incrementing the tab counter.

       SPR:  10-34733

535    Wildcard protect command where the same file name exists on two
       structures  results  in  both  files  being renamed twice each.
       Don't look for a file on all  structures  when  doing  wildcard
       rename,  just  look  for  the  file  on  the structure that the
       directory says it's on.

       SPR:  10-35079

536    532 broke deleting a list of files.  All files listed  after  a
       wildcarded  file specification would not get deleted, and a PIP
       command error message would be issued.  As per the SPR response
       sent by the customer of 532, save and restore GENERI around the
       call to ININIT.

       No SPR

537    Add some  consistency  checks  in  the  code  that  reads  line
       sequence  numbers  to watch for a file that's really binary and
       not line sequenced ASCII.

       SPR:  10-33544

540    Fix a DATE-75 bug when creating  files  with  a  protection  of
       <000>.  This normally happens when concatenating input files.

       SPR:  10-35149

541    Make sure non-wildcarded deletes on a specific structure  don't
       search  LIB:.   Also,  lite  RB.DSL  so we don't get protection
       failure on files from /SYS or /LIB.

       SPR:  10-31791

542    541 didn't know that CHKFIL assumes the PPN to be pushed on the
       stack.  Make it know that.

       No SPR.

543    Edit 306 allows files to be created with a .COPY  command  that
       may  have  RP.DIR  set.   Only  copy  RP.DIR  if a RENAME is in
       progress.  Creation of .SFD  and  .UFD  files  get  RP.DIR  set
       automagically anyway.

       SPR:  10-32940

544    Update copyright notice.

       No SPR.

545    Copy the quota words when renaming directories.

       QAR:  868386

546    Make sure it's  still  possible  to  type  .EXE  files  so  the

PIP.DOC -- Changes from V33B to V33C(505)
November 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

Version  33C  of  the  Peripheral  Interchange  Program  (PIP)  is   a
maintenance  release  including all known bug fixes.  It also includes
fixes to handle ersatz devices and SFD's correctly.

In general, PIP version 33C is more consistent and makes better use of
series-6  monitor  facilities than did version 33B.  PIP now makes use
of extended LOOKUP blocks.  Command processing and error handling have
been  improved.   PIP now utilizes MACTEN and UUOSYM, and many symbols
have been changed to standardize them.  LEVELC conditionalization  has
been extended.

PIP will run under any monitor supported by DEC for the  DECsystem-10.
It has been tested under 6.03, 6.03A, 7.00, and 7.01.

PIP is fully documented in the Users  Handbook  and  in  the  Software
Notebooks.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The following visible changes have been made:

In PIP version 33B, if a PPN was specified for either source or object
but  not  both,  it  was  assumed  for  the  other.   This  meant that
FILE2/R=FILE1[10,20] was the same as FILE2[10,20]/R=FILE1 and  neither
command would change the UFD of the file.  It is generally agreed that
PPNs and path specifications  should  never  be  "sticky"  across  the
equals-sign,  but  total compliance with this ideal was inappropriate,
as it caused PIP to RENAME or PROTECT files into  one's  default  path
under certain conditions.

This "feature" has been corrected in version 33C, which will  use  the
default path any time that a path is not specified on that side of the
equals-sign, except in RENAMEs (and DELETEs), when the input path will
be  used.   Note  that COPY FILE2=FILE1[10,20], for example, will copy
the  input  file  correctly  into  the  default   path,   but   RENAME
FILE2=FILE1[10,20]  will not change the UFD or SFD of the file to that
of the default path.

There is one visible difference between this release of  PIP  and  the
current  versions  of  SCAN and WILD with reference to ersatz devices.
DIRECT ignores the setting of NEW in the user's search list when  SYS:
is  specified.   PIP uses the setting of NEW in the user's search list
and uses [1,5] when SYS:  is specified.
PIP33C.DOC                                                      Page 8


Operations such as RENAME FILE.* and  DELETE  ALL:FILE.EXT  no  longer
return  an  ?Ambiguous...  error when FILE.* or FILE.EXT exist on more
than one structure in the search list.

The DELETED/RENAMED typeout now displays the name of the structure  on
which the deleted/renamed file resides.  This was implemented to allow
use of RENAME FILE.* and DELETE ALL:FILE.EXT with greater  confidence.
If this feature is not desired at a particular installation, it can be
disabled by replacing PUSHJ P,P6BIT at INFO3+3 with JRST INFO3B.

Filenames are now typed with internal spaces.

Ersatz device and wildcard handling have been improved.

A control-Z typed at TTY command level  now  causes  PIP  to  exit  to
monitor level.

PIP's command processor now accepts only the /M switch on  the  second
and following files when multiple input files are specified.

PIP's command scanner no longer erroneously accepts wildcards  of  the
form  "P*LIB".   Before, this would have been identical to "P*";  now,
the "L" will be detected as an error.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

If identical filenames exists on more than one structure in  a  search
list,  a  wildcard  PROTECT  which includes such files will cause each
such file on each structure in the search list to be reprotected  each
time  such  a  file  is  encountered.   In other words, such files are
reprotected too many times.   This  bug  will  not  produce  incorrect
results, since the file(s) in question will be properly protected each
time.  It is, however, a very complex  problem,  and  a  fix  will  be
released when one is available.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The previous support for Level C monitors or possibly very old or very
small Level D monitors is under the control of the feature test switch
LEVELC.  This includes code such as CLOSE UUO's  before  RENAME  UUO's
and support for failure of the DEVPPN UUO.  This conditionalization is
more comprehensive in PIP  version  33C  than  in  version  33B.   For
installations which require such support, assemble PIP with the LEVELC
switch set to 1.  The supported setting of this switch is 0.

PIP now searches UUOSYM and MACTEN.   These  files  are  required  for
assembly.

PIP.DOC -- Changes from V33A to V33B(260)
February 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

Version  33B  of  the  Peripheral  Interchange  Program  (PIP)  is   a
maintenance  release  including all known bug fixes.  It also includes
several minor additions to make its commands more similar to SCAN  and
WILD  conventions.   It  includes  a  general implementation of ersatz
device recognition.  It includes fixes to  handle  default  paths  and
SFD's correctly.

PIP will run under any monitor supported by DEC for the  DECsystem-10.
PIP  version  33B  conforms  to  DATE75 standards.  It has been tested
under 5.07, 6.01, and 6.02.

PIP is fully documented in the Users  Handbook  and  in  the  Software
Notebooks.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The following visible changes have been made:

The ersatz device routines have been rewritten to handle  all  current
and  anticipated  ersatz  devices.  Special code is included to handle
ALL:, NUL:, and system search list  devices.   There  is  one  visible
difference  between  this  release  of PIP and the current versions of
SCAN and WILD with reference to ersatz devices.   DIRECT  ignores  the
setting of NEW in the user's search list when SYS:  is specified.  PIP
uses the setting of NEW in the user's search list and uses [1,5]  when
SYS:  is specified.

The default project-programmer number specifications are now the  same
as  those  used by SCAN.  That is forms such as [10,], [,100], and [,]
now refer to the job's UFD instead of using  a  previous  default  PPN
specification.   Also  [-]  can  be used to refer to the job's default
path specification.

The full wildcard file name specifications are now allowed as  defined
for  WILD.   An  asterisk  after  a  partial file name or extension is
converted to the appropriate number of question marks to fill out  the
name or extension, NAM* is equivalent to NAM???.

This version reverts to  the  previous  practice  of  sending  control
characters  to the TTY:  as themselves rather than ^CHAR+100.  This is
to allow control sequences to be correctly sent to TTY's  that  accept
them.  For users desiring to type out TECO macros or DDT files, the /J
switch specified with TTY output will convert the  characters  in  the
way version 33 did.
PIP33B.DOC                                                     Page 22


PIP now correctly handles default paths and full  SFD  specifications.
The default path is now used at any time there is no specified path.

For rename commands the  specification  of  a  source  device  is  now
handled  differently.   A  rename  command  can  specify no device, an
output device (the source device is assumed to be  the  same),  or  an
output and a source device.  If both are given, they must be identical
unless the source is a system search list device (e.g.  NEW:).   These
restrictions  are due to the fact that a RENAME UUO can not physically
move a file, but can change its UFD.  Also, if a PPN is specified  for
either  source  or  object  but not both, it is assumed for the other.
This   means   that    FILE2/R=FILE1[10,20]    is    the    same    as
FILE2[10,20]/R=FILE1  and  neither  command will change the UFD of the
file.  This is to allow name changes of a file without having to  type
the PPN on both names.

Wild cards on the output side of a copy without  /X  now  imply  a  /X
operation.   This  is  to make PIP's operation consistent with that of
COMPIL.

The mode of all files involved in disk or DECtape to disk  or  DECtape
transfers is now preserved.  When /B is used (to speed up processing),
the actual input/output is done in mode 14, but the original file mode
is  preserved.   This allows files which have been copied by PIP to be
queued to the paper tape punch correctly.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Commands of the  form  C=A,B/B  generate  illegal  memory  references.
Reported in SPR 13705.

PIP believes  the  monitor  supplied  byte  counts  for  input/output.
Therefore,  every 81st column of a card deck punched out in image mode
is lost.
Reported in SPR 9156.

Wild card file specifications implying or using UFD as an extension do
not   work.    the   use   of   "*.UFD"  will  look  for  files  named
"120000000000.UFD".  Discovered internally.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Some of the previous support for Level C monitors or possibly very old
or  very  small Level D monitors has been put under the control of the
feature test switch LEVELC.  This includes code such  as  CLOSE  UUO's
before  RENAME  UUO's  and support for failure of the DEVPPN UUO.  For
installations which require such support, assemble PIP with the LEVELC
switch set to 1.  The supported setting of this switch is 0.
PIP33B.DOC                                                     Page 23


For all supported monitors, there are no changes to  the  installation
instructions.

For monitors running with FTSFD==0 (prior to 5.07B/6.01B), there is  a
bug  in FILUUO which must be fixed.  At PTHUU8-1, inside the IFE FTSFD
conditional, in front  of  the  MOVE  T4,JBTPPN##(J)  insert  a  SKIPN
T4,DEVPPN(F).

       No SPR.

160    Change file concatenation to treat the last file  in  the  same

       monitor is broken.

       No SPR.

237    Change the directory used for SYS:  when NEW is in  the  search
       list  from  [1,5]  to  [1,4].   This only applies to operations
       which require that the directory be read.

240    Move 235 to fix TMP:  messages also.

       No SPR.

241    Change  135  to  be  a  conditional  assembly  parameter.   The
       supported  setting  is  outputting  control  characters without
       conversion to any TTY.

244    Change 206 to make wild card output file  specifications  imply
       /X  for copy operations.  This makes PIP's operation consistent
       with that of COMPIL.  Also  do  not  allow  directories  to  be
       output to a wild card output specification.

245    Correct 235 and 240 so that the correct device is typed out for

246    Correct page numbering on long directory listings.

       SPR 7752.

247    Preserve the mode of all files copied from one directory device
       to  another.   The ENTER is done using the original mode of the
       file, and then a SETSTS is done to set the mode  to  correspond
       to the switches specified (/B, /I, /H).

       SPR's 7863, 14063.

250    Type out any error messages found during searches for files  in
       /R  and  /D  processing  which do not have to do with "file not
       found" (i.e.  RIB error or protection failure).

       SPR's 8231, 8285.

251    Change 241 to type out all control characters as such unless  a
       /J  switch  is  given.  Provide an assembly switch to allow the
       reversal of this action (unsupported - CTLTTY).

       No SPR.

252    Allow switches, PPN's and protections to follow octal file name
       specifications (i.e.  #12/X=FOO).

253    Fix /T and /C to correctly check for null lines and  provide  a

260    Remove 237.  It made PIP inconsistent within itself, and  found
       a  second  monitor  bug.  For installations which would like to

one edit.

PIP is documented in Software Notebook vol.  6.

This version of PIP supersedes all previous versions.  It  runs  under
all supported monitors.  The DATE-75 project is fully implemented.

There are no CUSP dependencies.



2.0    EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0    KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Far too many to enumerate.



4.0    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

PIP33.DOC -- Changes from V32(37) to V33(77)
April 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

PIP version 33 is version 32 with edits #40 through #77.  This version
has no new deficiencies and fully replaces version 32.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

#1     Copying between DSK, DTA and  MTA  is  in  binary  by  default,
       unless one output file is being made from multiple input files,
       in which case the default node  is  ascii.   A  new  switch  is
       needed to force character by character copying.

#2     In nested indirect files it is not possible to return  from  an
       indirect file and continue reading from a previous one.

#3     PIP has no ascii mode switch.

#4     PIP  inserts  blank  tape  between  PDP-8  binary  tapes   when
       concatenating them.

#5     SPR-6059
       TYPE A,B,C
       Where A, and B do not exist produces PDL OV, ILL  MEM  REF,  or
       other random errors.

#6     SPR 10-6364
       /X=A/A,B/B
       Does not change the mode for file B.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

40     Device SYS did not work in small monitor (5.04), because DEVPPN
       UUO does not work.  Fix is to test for 5 series monitor and use
       [1,4] if DEVPPN fails rather than [1,1].

41     PIP gave a fatal ?  error if a delete failed because  file  was
       not there.

       Fix is to give warning % error in this case  since  it  is  not
       fatal.

42     Non-standard protection got turned off after  the  first  file.
       This was a bug introduced when setting protection for

       level D enter.  Fix is to test for level D and if so  skip  the
       rename.

43     Output project-programmer number was defaulting over to

       input side.  Fix, clear PPN on equals and left arrow.

44     Resequencing a file lost the character after the sequence

       number.  Bug introduced in v32, remove it.

45     File structure search logic does  not  work  in  small  monitor
       (5.04).

       The is no fence so PIP does not believe -1 is end of F/S.

       Fix is to test for both 0 and -1.

46     Device SYS does not work correctly.  PIP uses

       SYSSTR UUO to find SYS:, this is not correct.

       Fix use GOBSTR UUO, this fixes both SYS:  and DSK:.

47     COPY command to DTA causes tape to rock.  Low segment

       has grown so that double buffers won't fit.  Fix test for  this
       and try

       to expand so that at least 2 buffers are used.

50     Level C only, wild card commands do not work.  The

       UFD device is not inited.  Fix, if not a level D  generic  disk
       make sure UFD is inited.

51     Remove WCH conditional (old PDP-6 dectape format).
PIP33.DOC                                                      Page 41


       This saves space and time and makes the listing neater.

52     Remove DISK30 conditional (TEN30 single user disk format).

53     Command line (from TTY) storage is poor.

       It gives a free cr-lf after 72 characters  (so  does  monitor),
       and

       has a limit of 41 words.

       Fix remove extra cr-lf code.  Allow for undetermined

       length of command line by getting space from free  core.   This
       saves

       space for short commands and allows extra long ones.

54     More of above

55     No UFD created message doesn't give structure  name.   Fix  add
       F/S after message.
PIP33.DOC                                                      Page 42


56     /A to a binary file gives ill mem ref.  PIP  thinks  binary  is
       sequence number.  Fix, remove bug so that

       the binary will be transfered as ascii (losing  bit  35),  this
       removes

       the ill mem ref.  However no  message  is  given  to  the  user
       (unless he is listing

       the file) since PIP has no way of knowing the file is binary.

57     Line too long message is output whenever a line is longer

       than the internal line  buffer  (132  chars.).   Fix,  make  it
       happen

       only on /A .  This allows files created by TECO to

       be listed etc.

60     Change the definitions of ac P from 5 to 17, and CALFLG

       from 17 to 5, since most programs have pushdown

       pointer in 17.

61     *.* is handled differently from ??????.???, this wastes

       space and does not allow users to enter *.* as an octal mask.

       Fix, convert *.* to ??????.???  and use the wild  card  masking
       code,

       remove all special checks for *.  On output convert ??????.???

       back to *.*.

63     # number is not handled correctly, it is  right  justified  and
       does not allow mixed # and alpha.

       Fix, use 3 bit left justified bytes,  and  allow  mixed  #  and
       alphas.

64     More of above.

65     PIP loops if tape ID is specified but device does not exist.

       Fix, clear TAPEID flag at IOERRN.

66     Block free message is incorrect after  an  error.   Fix,  clear
       BLKSUM.

67     Rename on DTA is not always correct,@it doesn't check
PIP33.DOC                                                      Page 43


       for name already existing.  PIP does not use

       rename uuo, it reads directory and changes entries in it.

       Fix, remove that code and do a RENAME UUO.

70     Can not delete from more than one [ppn].  An old restriction.

       Fix, remove restriction.

71     /T to a blank line changes multiple blanks, cr-lf into

       one blank cr-lf, but then loses the lf.

       Fix, account for extra character by IBP OPTR at PSCAN7.

72     PIP will not assemble with REENT=0.

       Fix, remove multiply defined labels DERR7.

73     PIP has extra <cr> in source file not followed

       by <lf>.  Fix, remove them (5 occurrences).

74     File name generation for input from non-directory devices

       is not correct (bug introduced by #61).  Fix it.
PIP33.DOC                                                      Page 44


75     Fix various bugs in SFD logic.  PIP will now

       read, write, rename, and delete files in SFD's.
       Note, PIP will not (now or ever) list directories

       of SFD's, use DIRECT for that function.

76     Previous fix to allow null files to be copies causes

       problems with non-directory devices since they key on a null

       file to terminate a /X copy of multiple files.

       Fix, allow null files only from DSK and DTA, and

       put back some of the code removed in version 31.

77     /Y fails to copy a single file, previous changes in version 31

       changed action of LOOK routine but did not change RIMSW

       code.  Fix, if only one file is specified do not read UFD,

       just do a LOOKUP on required file.
