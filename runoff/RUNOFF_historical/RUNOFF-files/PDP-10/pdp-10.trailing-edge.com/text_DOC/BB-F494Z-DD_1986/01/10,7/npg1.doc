NOPAG0.DOC -- V1(1)
March 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

When KLI (an RSX20F task) loads a file into -10 memory it first zeroes
any  page  into which the file will load.  LINK, and the SAVE command,
store some numbers into page 0 of a .SAV file (.JBSA, .JBFF,  .JBCOR).
If KLI loads BOOTS into -10 memory, the "regular" .SAV file will cause
KLI to zero page 0 of -10 memory, not  conducive  to  crash  analysis.
NOPAG0 is a program which removes all references to page 0 from a .SAV
file, so that page 0 of -10 memory remains intact.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES (USER INTERFACE)

To remove all references to page 0 of a .SAV file:

     .RUN NOPAG0
