SPACE.DOC -- Changes from V2(45) to V3(70)
March 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

This release is motivated by the DATE-75 project.  It also includes  a
number  of  minor  clean-ups.   There  are  no  significant functional
changes.

This  version  has  been  tested  on  6.01/5.07.   It  has  no   known
deficiencies.   No  bug reports have been received on version 2 and no
SPRs are outstanding.

SPACE is unsupported and is documented only in its HELP file.

The function of SPACE is to list the amount of disk space used by each
user.   Optionally, it will make entries in the system accounting file
via DAEMON.  If any users are over quota, or failed to  LOGOUT,  SPACE
will  optionally submit a batch job to recompute their space usage and
bring them below quota if necessary.



2.0  CHANGES

       blocks.

       number.

       HELPER.REL.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Assemble using C and QPRM as  universals.   The  routines  QUEUER  and
HELPER will automatically be loaded from device "REL:".  The result is
a .SHR file.  Hence, if  C.UNV  and  QPRM.UNV  are  on  UNV:   and  if
HELPER.REL and QUEUER.REL are on REL:, simply:

     .LOAD SPACE.MAC
     .SSAVE

and place SPACE.SHR and SPACE.HLP on SYS:.
