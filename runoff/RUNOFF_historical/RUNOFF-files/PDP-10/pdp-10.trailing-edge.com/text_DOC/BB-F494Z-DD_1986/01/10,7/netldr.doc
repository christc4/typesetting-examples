SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

NETLDR is the DECsystem-10 bootstrap  program  that  dumps  and  loads
network remote stations such as the DN82.  For NETLDR to run properly,
there must be a bootstrap program running in the remote station  being
loaded.   In  the  case  of the DC72, this bootstrap is read in from a
deck of cards by the remote station operator.   In  the  case  of  the
DN82,  either  the  BM873  or  M9301  ROM  must  be running.  The DN82
generally jumps to the ROM when it crashes, which allows it to  reload
itself without operator intervention.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Running On FRCLIN

NETLDR automatically DETACHes if it is running on FRCLIN.



2.2  GALAXY And OPR

NETLDR now does "WTOR"  QUEUE.   UUOs  in  order  to  "log"  automatic
operation  with  the  system operator.  If GALAXY is not running, then
NETLDR "falls back" to TRMOP.ing directly to the system CTY.



2.3  NETLDR Booting Messages

NETLDR now includes the host system node name in the bootstrap message
text logged with the system and sent to the remote stations.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

NETLDR has no known bugs.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To load NETLDR, the JOBDAT, MACTEN, and UUOSYM universal files  should
be  on  UNV:,  and  HELPER.REL  should  be  on REL:.  Then just ".LOAD
NETLDR" and save it.  NETLDR.EXE should be shareably-saved on SYS:.

NETLDR.INI  is  not  distributed  as   it   contains   site   specific
information.   Each  site should create an appropriate NETLDR.INI file
and put it on SYS: for "automatic" NETLDR remote station  dumping  and
loading operations.
NETLDR.DOC -- Changes from %3(135) to %4(146)                   Page 3
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


The automatic reload feature can be disabled by typing:

     .SET SCHED 1000



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The internal changes are available in the source file NETLDR.MAC  near
the begining of the file under the subtitle "Edit History".



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.



7.0  NETLDR OPERATION

NETLDR  may  be  run  either  automatically  or  explicitly   by   the
DECsystem-10 operator.



7.1  Automatic Execution Of NETLDR

A network node which wishes to be loaded may  send  a  "REQUEST  LOAD"
message  over  its  synchronous  line.   The  node  which receives the
request will transmit the message to the  DECsystem-10  as  a  station
control  message.   The  monitor will automatically run NETLDR when it
receives such a request.

A request may include sufficient information for NETLDR  to  dump  and
load  as  requested.   If  insufficient  information is present in the
request, NETLDR will search SYS:NETLDR.INI for a  line  which  matches
the  request.   Lines  in NETLDR.INI contain two parts separated by an
equal sign.  The left half of each line is of the form:


     /NODE:name/LINE:lnum/TYPE:type/SERIAL:snum

Where "name" is the name or number of the node adjacent to the node to
be  booted;   "lnum"  is  the  synchronous line number on the adjacent
node;  "type" is the type of node in which the  bootstrap  is  running
(one  of  DC71, DC72, DN82, DAS82, DN92, DAS92, or DN200);  and "snum"
is the serial number supplied by the  bootstrap  in  the  node  to  be
booted.  Whatever is on the left of the equals sign must match exactly
with the information supplied with the request load message.
NETLDR.DOC -- Changes from %3(135) to %4(146)                   Page 4
NETLDR OPERATION


The right half of each line must be in the form of:

     = cmd(1), cmd(2),. . ., cmd(N)

Where "cmd" is a filespec and/or switches as described in section 7.2.
The default device is SYS: for loading and XPN: for dumping.

Example:

     /NODE:ZOT/LINE:1/TYPE:DN82/SERIAL:7=/D,DN82 !Comment

This dumps the node connected to line  1  of  node  ZOT  onto  XPN  as
ZOT.LSD and then loads the node with SYS:DN82.BIN.

Switches /NODE, /LINE, and /PDP8 or /PDP11 need not  be  specified  on
the right of the equals sign in NETLDR.INI as the request load message
supplies this information to NETLDR.



7.2  Operator Use Of NETLDR.

The NETLDR program performs system operations on  remote  nodes.   The
type  of  remote  node  and the desired operations are specified using
switches in the file specification.

NETLDR can be used to clear, dump  and  load  a  remote  node  and  to
execute software on remote nodes.

Command format:

     .R NETLDR

NETLDR then issues the prompt:

     File:

The user must then enter a command string of the form:

     filespec/M-switch/N-switch/CH-switch/OPT-switch/OPT-switch

Where filespec is of the form:

     dev:filename.ext[proj,prog]

The filespec argument is optional.  If ext is omitted for a load,  the
default extension is .BIN.  If the filespec is omitted for a dump, the
file written is nodename.LSD on the user's disk area.

M-switch is a required switch  specifying  that  the  remote  node  is
either a PDP-8 or PDP-11.  For example:

     /PDP8 or /8

NETLDR OPERATION


     /PDP11 or /11

N-switch is a required  switch  identifying  the  remote  node.   This
switch may take one of the following forms:

     /NODE:num           specifying the number of the remote node

     /NODE:nam           specifying the name of the remote node

CH-switch is a required switch specifying the number of  the  line  to
which  is  attached  the  node  to be used.  The /SELF argument may be
entered if the remote node specified by the  /NODE  switch  is  to  be
used.

     /LINE:num           specifying the hardware line  number  in  the
                         range 0 through 17 (octal).  "Num" identifies
                         the  node  that  the  operation  is  for   by
                         specifying  the  line number connecting to it
                         from the remote node.

     /SELF               specifying that the operation is for the node
                         itself.

OPT-switch is one of the following:

     /CLEAR              clears the memory of the remote node.

                         Default 0 - 17777 for a PDP8.

                         Default 0 - 77776 for a PDP11.

     /CLEAR:x-y          clears memory location x through  location  y
                         inclusive.

     /CLEAR:x-*          clears memory location x through 17777 for  a
                         PDP-8;  77776 for a PDP-11.

     /DUMP               creates an octal dump of  the  remote  node's
                         memory into the specified file (0-17777 for a
                         PDP-8;  0-77776 for a PDP-11).  If no file is
                         specified  the  default  is nodename.LSD.  If
                         the  filename  has  question  marks  in   it,
                         numbers  will  be  supplied  for the question
                         marks starting with 0 if the index  file  has
                         not been created, or with the filename in the
                         index file +1 if it has  been  created.   The
                         index file contains the name of the last file
                         dumped and has the filename given by the user
                         in the dump command.

     /DUMP:x-y           dumps memory locations x through y inclusive.

     /DUMP:x-*           dumps memory location x through the machine's
                         upper  limit (17777 for a PDP-8;  77776 for a

NETLDR OPERATION


                         PDP-11).

     /HELP               prints a list of the switches available.

     /HPQ:x              run NETLDR in HPQ x.

     /IMAGE              the file to be read is in image mode.

     /LOAD               load the file into the remote node's  memory,
                         but do not start the program.

     /PACKED             the file is a binary file in MACDLX format.

     /START:adr          load the file into the remote  node's  memory
                         and  start  it  at the specified address.  If
                         the filespec  is  omitted  and  the  /START:X
                         switch  is in the command string, the node is
                         started at address x.

Defaults:

     1.  Specifying PTR as the device implies image mode.

     2.  The default upper memory location for a PDP-8 is 17777.

     3.  The default upper memory location for a PDP-11 is 77776.

     4.  The default extension for a load is .BIN.

     5.  The default dump file is nodename.LSD.

     6.  The default device for /DUMP and /LOAD is DSK.

     7.  The default load format is /IMAGE for a PDP-8.

     8.  The default load format is /PACKED for a PDP-11.

Examples:

File:  DSKN:NYC[14,16]/NODE:BOSTON/LINE:0/PDP11/START:1000

          Load the file NYC.BIN from DSKN area  [14,16]  on  the  host
          node  into  the  node connected to line 0 of node BOSTON and
          start the program at address 1000.

File:  /DUMP/NODE:BOSTON/SELF/PDP11

          dump locations 0-77776 of node BOSTON onto  DSK  as  a  file
          named BOSTON.LSD.

File:  /CLEAR:10-74/PDP11/NODE:2/LINE:1

          Clear locations 10 through 74 of the node connected to  line
          1 of node number 2.
