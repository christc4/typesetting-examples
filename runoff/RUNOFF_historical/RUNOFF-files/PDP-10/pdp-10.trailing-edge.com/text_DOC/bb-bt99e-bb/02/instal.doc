           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-10  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-10  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 10B of ALGOL-10

            Version 23 of ANF10

            Version 2 of the APL products:
        
                APL-10
                APLSF-10

            Version 12B of COBOL-68/74

            Version 5A of DBMS-10

            Version 10 of DECMAIL/MS-10

            Version 7.02 of DECNET-10 MCB

            Version 10 of FORTRAN-10

            Version 7.02 of GALAXY-10
                                                                  Page 2



            Version 4 of IBMCOM/ET-10

            Version 1 of IBMCOM/HASP-10

            Version 5.1 of LINK-10

            Version 1 of RMS-10

            Version 4C of SORT-10

            Version 7.02 of TOPS-10 and Utilities
                                                                  Page 3


     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.



     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  DSKP:,  we
     recommend  that  you make an entry in your login procedures so that
     DSKP:  is assigned to be the structure you will be using.   If  you
     do  this  and  use the default [7,6] ppn, you will not need to edit
     the BACKUP retrieval command files provided to set-up  the  product
     distribution directories and to process the patch tape.

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  BACKUP  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed  in  [2,5]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following files should be installed in the disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP101.PDF
                UPDATE.EXE

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also contains indirect command  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These BACKUP CCL files are intended to be run  interactively.   See
     the last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-10-V2  product  you
     would install
                                                                  Page 4

                APL1S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL1S2.CCL      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.

     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-10-V10B  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D608D-SB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5069D-SB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   ALGOL-10
     distribution directory.
        
        From save set ALGOL-SOURCES
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
                                                                  Page 6


     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ALG].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ALG] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ALG10B.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ANF10

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS  10  V7.02
     Monitor  distribution  tape BB-X140A-SB into the disk directory you
     have set up as the ANF10 distribution directory.
        
        CHK11.P11       DN2741.P11      DNCDDH.P11      DNCDDQ.P11
        DNCDMC.P11      DNCDUP.P11      DNCNFG.P11      DNCOMM.P11
        DNCRD.P11       DNCTAB.P11      DNDBG.P11       DNDCMP.P11
        DNDCP4.P11      DNDEV.P11       DNDH11.P11      DNDL10.P11
        DNDM11.P11      DNDN11.P11      DNDTE.P11       DNDZ11.P11
        DNLBLK.P11      DNLPT.P11       DNNCL.P11       DNNSP.P11
        DNNSP3.P11      DNRDA.P11       DNRDE.P11       DNTRCE.P11
        DNTSK.P11       DNTTY.P11       MACROS.P11      S.P11
        TSKTST.P11

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ANF].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ANF] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ANFV23.CCL[7,6]
        
     The  MON702.CCL  file  will  also  put  the  files  for  ANF   into
     DSKP:[7,6,ANF].   Users of Autopatch for the first time do not need
     to  use  the  ANFV23.CCL  file  if  the  [7,6,ANF]  area  has  been
     established prior to use of the MON702.CCL file.

     The ANF product is NOT rebuilt by Autopatch.  The Autopatch process
     will  update  the  supported  sources in the DIS:  area.  After the
     INSTALL command has  been  processed,  the  customer  may  use  the
     sources  in  DIS:  to rebuild the product with procedures which are
     appropriate to the site.

     The Patch control file for the update of this product  as  well  as
     the   Autopatch  product  description  file  are  supplied  in  the
     Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last  section
     of  this  document  for  a  list of these files.  There is a BACKUP
     command file provided in the  first  Save-set  which  will  restore
     these  files to the proper directory.  See the README documentation
     file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Both APL-10 and APLSF-10 are  autopatchable  with  Autopatch-10/20.
     Before  preparing  these  products for autopatching, they should be
     installed  on  your  system  as  described  in   the   installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.
                                                                  Page 9

        From save set "COBOL-74-KL-Build"

        COBASM.MAC      for Cobol-74

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CBL].  If  you
                                                                 Page 13


     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CBL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
     To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBL168.CCL[7,6]  for Cobol-68
                or
        /@DSKP:CBL174.CCL[7,6]  for Cobol-74
                or
        /@DSKP:CBL12B.CCL[7,6]  for Cobol-74 from the re-release tape
        
     Use of any of these files will also restore the SORT files  on  the
     COBOL  tape  to  the DSKP:[7,6,SRT] area.  Also the following files
     are restored by these CCL files but not used by Autopatch:

        CRELD.MAC       GETERA.MAC      SETEOF.MAC      SRTTAB.MAC
        STRNGL.MAC

     If you will be Autopatching BOTH Cobol-68 and Cobol-74 or the 68274
     Translation  Tool  and  one  or both of the compilers new files are
     required in the patching directory.  Obtain the COBASM.MAC file for
     Cobol-68 and make a copy named C68ASM.MAC.  Likewise, obtain a copy
     of  the  COBASM.MAC  file  for  Cobol-74  and  make  a  copy  named
     C74ASM.MAC.

     If you will be Autopatching the 68274  translation  tool  you  must
     create a copy of the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set on
     and call it TRNASM.MAC.  For more information refer to section  6.0
     of the COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12B distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     When SELECTing COBOL with PEP you will be asked if  you  are  using
     the  multi-seg  compiler.  Unless you have set the ONESEG switch on
     in the COBASM.MAC file the correct answer is YES.  In order to have
     Autopatch  include  the  SORT  module in the OTS you must create an
     empty file named CBLSRT.FLG in the patching directory  (PAT:).   If
     the   process  can  find  CBLSRT.REL  it  will  then  be  included.
     Likewise, in order to have Autopatch include support  for  DBMS  in
     the  OTS  you  must  create  an  empty file named CBLDBM.FLG in the
     patching directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                FORDML.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DAEMDB.EXE

     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  DBMS-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D478D-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-C804D-BB(800 BPI)
     into the disk directory you have set up as the DBMS-10 distribution
     directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
                                                                 Page 15


     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,DBM].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,DBM] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DBMV5A.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 16


     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET UTILITIES

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DECNET-10-UTILITIES is referred to as the product installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                NCPTAB.REL
                NFT.EXE
                NML.EXE
                NRT.EXE
                SWIL.REL
                SWIL.UNV

     The following files are required  to  build  the  DECNET  UTILITIES
     product.   They  must  be  available  either  in  the patching area
     (PAT:), the distribution area (DIS:), or in the  installation  area
     (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        ACTSYM.UNV      JOBDAT.UNV      MACTEN.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS-10  DECNET
     7.02 distribution tape BB-X116A-SB into the disk directory you have
     set up as the TOPS-10 distribution directory.
        
           From the fourth save set - DECNET CUSPS
        
                FAL.MAC         SWILIO.MAC
                NCPTAB.MAC      SWIMEM.MAC
                NFT.MAC         SWIMSC.MAC
                NIP.MAC         SWINET.MAC
                NRT.MAC         SWIQUE.MAC
                SWIL.MAC        SWISCN.MAC
                SWIERM.MAC      SWITOU.MAC
                SWIFIL.MAC      SWIWLD.MAC
                SWIHLP.MAC      TSC.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CSP].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CSP] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
                                                                 Page 17


        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DCN702.CCL[7,6]
        

     This command file will also restore the  files  necessary  for  the
     DECNET modules of the MONITOR to DSKP:[7,6,MON] area.

     If you have previously Autopatched the DECNET monitor  modules  you
     are advised to use the DNU702.CCL file to load the DECNET utilities
     and NOT the DCN702.CCL file.

     Users who have Autopatched NFT V1  should  RESTORE  NFT  with  PEP,
     DESELECT  NFT  with PEP, and use the DNU702.CCL file in preparation
     for the installation of DECNET-10-UTILITIES for Autopatching.   The
     new  utilities  product  adds  NCPTAB,  NML,  and  NRT  as  well as
     incorporating all edits to NFT.

     The Autopatch product description file for this product is supplied
     in  the  Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a listing of this file.   There  is  a
     BACKUP  command  file  provided  in  the  first Save-set which will
     restore  this  file  to  the  proper  directory.   See  the  README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 18


     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-10   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                FORTRA.EXE
                SINGLE.EXE
                FORTB.EXE
                FORTC.EXE
                FORTD.EXE
                FORTE.EXE
                FORTF.EXE
                FORTG.EXE
                DORTRA.EXE
                DORTB.EXE
                DOTRC.EXE
                DORTD.EXE
                DORTE.EXE
                DORTF.EXE
                DORTG.EXE
                FORO10.EXE
                FORLIB.REL
                FORDDT.REL

     The FORTRAN V10 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-10 V10 distribution  tape  BB-D480F-SB  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-10 distribution
     directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,FTN].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,FTN] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN10.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN10R.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        

     If you use DBMS with FORTRAN and want to have the  Autopatch  Patch
     and  Build Control file build DBMSF you must create a dummy file in
                                                                 Page 21


     the patching directory (PAT:) called FTNDBM.FLG.  The  presence  of
     this  file  on PAT:  will cause the BATCH control file to branch in
     order to perform the processing required to build  DBMSF.EXE.   You
     will  also need the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second save-set of the
     Autopatch tape.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a BACKUP command  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for more information.

     3.8  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING GALAXY-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for GALAXY-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                BATCON.EXE      ORION.EXE
                CDRIVE.EXE      PLEASE.EXE
                GALGEN.EXE      PULSAR.EXE

                GLXMAC.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV

     The following files are required to build the GALAXY product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        UFDSET.REL      UUOSYM.UNV      WILD.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  TOPS-10  7.02
     CUSP distribution tape BB-X128A-SB into the disk directory you have
     set up as the GALAXY-10 distribution directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,GAL].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,GAL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this  command  to
     change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.

     An indirect command file which restores  all  autopatched  products
     from  the  CUSP  tape has also been provided.  The use of this file
     (CSP702.CCL)  will  place  this  product  in   the   DSKP:[7,6,CSP]
     directory.   Also, be sure to specify this directory for DIS:  when
     SELECTing the product with PEP.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:GAL702.CCL[7,6]
        or
        /@DSKP:CSP702.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP Retrieval Command File provided in the first Save-set  which
     will  restore  these files to the proper directory.  See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.9  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING IBMCOM-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for IBMCOM-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  LINK-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                LINK.EXE                LNKOV1.EXE

     3.11  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING MCB-10


     Before preparing this product for Autopatching,  you  MUST  install
     the  product  on  your system as described in the DECnet-10 Network
     Generation and  Installation  Procedures  Manual  (AA-P379A-TB)  in
     Notebook  20  of  the  TOPS-10 Notebook set.  Unless the product is
     correctly installed,  you  will  not  be  able  to  SELECT  it  for
     Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  MCB-10  is  referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:

        DNMAC.EXE
        DTEDMP.SYS
        DTEMPS.SYS
        DTEMPT.SYS
        NETGEN.EXE
        NIPGEN.EXE
        TKB36.EXE
        VNP36.EXE
        nodename.SYS

     nodename.SYS is the front end system file with your node name

     You will need to copy all of the files in the third save set of the
     TOPS-10  DECNET  7.02  distribution  tape BB-X116A-SB into the disk
     directory you have set up as  the  MCB-10  distribution  directory.
     These files should already exist in a disk directory as part of the
     original DECNET-10 installation.  An indirect command control  file
     to  retrieve these files has been included in the installation save
     set on this patch tape.  This file  will  restore  the  appropriate
     files  to  DSKP:[7,6,MCB].   If you wish use this control file, but
     are not using DSKP:[7,6,MCB] as  your  distribution  directory  you
     will  have to edit this command file to change the /RESTORE command
     to correspond to your directory.


        To use this command file, issue the following commands:

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DCN702.CCL[7,6]


     This command file will also restore the  files  necessary  for  the
     DECNET  modules  of the MONITOR to DSKP:[7,6,MON] and the files for
     DECNET UTILITIES to DSKP:[7,6,CSP].

     If you have previously Autopatched the DECNET  monitor  modules  or
     the  DECNET UTILITIES you are advised to use the MCB702.CCL file to
     load the MCB-10 files and NOT the DCN702.CCL file.
                                                                 Page 30


     The DECNET-10 front end build also  requires  the  following  files
     from the original installation:

        CETAB.MAC
        NETPAR.MAC
        NMLACC.MAC

     The above files are NOT on the  release  tape.   They  are  created
     during  the  required  installation process.  NMLACC.MAC is deleted
     after  a  successful  front  end  build  to  protect  the   Network
     Management  Access  Control  information  it contains.  Path to the
     directory in which your front end was built and do the following:

        .R NETGEN
        NETGEN>RESTORE xxxxxx.CNF

        ;where xxxxxx is your front end node
        ;name.  The configuration file (.CNF)
        ;was automatically saved when you did
        ;the original installation.

        ;If your site doesn't use Network Management Access Control
        ;skip the following 3 DEFINE commands

        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT USER foo1
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT PASSWORD foo2
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT foo2

        NETGEN>FINISH

     Copy  CETAB.MAC  and   NETPAR.MAC   into   the   MCB-10   Autopatch
     distribution  directory.   If you wish the protection of having the
     NMLACC.MAC file deleted after a successful build,  rename  it  into
     the  directory  you  have set up as the patching directory, and the
     above procedure will be required before each  Autopatch  update  of
     MCB-10.   Otherwise,  copy  NMLACC.MAC  into  the  MCB-10 Autopatch
     distribution directory.

     When SELECTing this product for Autopatching the PEP  program  will
     ask  for  the  nodename.   Use the same name as was used during the
     initial  installation.   If  your  product  installation  directory
     (INS:)  does  not  include  the  front  end  system  image, usually
     "nodename".SYS, then copy it into that directory.

     Path back to your original directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation in the first Save-set for more information.

     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for MS-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.  In
     most cases this will be [1,4] or one of the  directories  belonging
     to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                MS.EXE

     The following file is required to build the MS product.  It must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXLIB.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  DECMAIL/MS
     distribution  tape BB-P525A-BB into the disk directory you have set
     up as the MS-10 distribution directory.
        
        From the third save set

        MS.REL  (renamed as MS1V10.REL in PAT:)
        MSX.REL


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MS].   If  you
     wish  to  use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MS] as

                SCPAR.MAC
                DECNET.FIL

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MON].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MON] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DCN702.CCL[7,6]
        

     This command file will also restore the files necessary for the NFT
     product into the DSKP:[7,6,CSP] area.

     The Autopatch product description file for this product is supplied
     in  the  Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a listing of this file.   There  is  a
     BACKUP  command  file  provided  in  the  first Save-set which will
     restore  this  file  to  the  proper  directory.   See  the  README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 37


     3.16  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TOPS-10-K?-V702

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  TOPS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
        TOPS-10-KL      TOPS-10-KS

        RL72Z.EXE       RS72Z.EXE
        TOPL10.REL      TOPS10.REL


     The R?72Z.EXE  file  is  a  copy  of  your  current  monitor.   The
     Autopatch  process  will create a new R?72Z.EXE in the installation
     directory(INS:).

     The following file is required to build the  MONITOR  product.   It
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        EDDT.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  TOPS-10  7.02
     BB-X140A-SB   Distribution   tape,   BB-X128A-SB   CUSP  tape,  and
     BB-X130A-SB Customer Supported tape into  the  disk  directory  you
     have set up as the TOPS-10 distribution directory.
