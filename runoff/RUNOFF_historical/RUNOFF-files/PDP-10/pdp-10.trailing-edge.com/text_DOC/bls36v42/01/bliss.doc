1.0  INTRODUCTION

This document provides  information  pertaining  to  BLISS-36  Version
4A(236).



2.0  NEW FEATURES

Version 4.1 of the BLISS language is upward  compatible  with  Version
4.0.   Each  change documented in this section includes a flag such as
<16> indicating which compilers it applies to.



3.0  COMPILER PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

4.0  CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

4.1  Move merging <All>

Assignments from consecutive fields of a source  area  to  consecutive
fields  of  a destination area now generate a single move instruction.
Also, assignments of literals to consecutive fields of  a  destination
area  should  now generate a single move instruction.  Thus, "A<3,3> =
.B<3,3>;  A<6,4> = .B<6,4>" will be turned into  "A<3,7>  =  .B<3,7>",
and "A<3,3> = 1;  A<6,4> = 3" will be turned into "A<3,7> = 19".



4.2  Comparison merging <All>

Similarly, ".A<3,3> EQL .B<3,3> AND .A<6,4> EQL .B<6,4>" will  now  be
turned  into ".A<3,7> EQL .B<3,7>", and ".A<3,3> EQL 1 AND .A<6,4> EQL
3"  will  be  turned  into  ".A<3,7>  EQL  19".    The   corresponding
transformation for ORs of NEQs is also performed.



4.3  Bit test merging <All>

Multiple bit tests on a single word will be turned into a  mask  test.
For example, ".A<4,1> OR .A<6,1>" will be turned into "(.A AND %X'50')
NEQ 0".



5.0  CORRECTIONS

This section describes changes to correct problems which  resulted  in
compiler failures or in the generation of incorrect code.
BLISS-36 Release 4A(236) For TOPS-20: Release Notes             Page 4


5.1  ENABLEs and initialized LOCALs <All>

Initialized local variables which are used in  an  ENABLE  declaration
are  now  zeroed  before  the  handler  is  enabled,  and  initialized
afterwards.  This allows handlers to determine  whether  an  exception
occurred  during  initialization  or  during  routine  body execution.
Previously, BLISS-32 was doing the initialization before  the  ENABLE;
BLISS-36 and BLISS-16 were doing the ENABLE before the initialization,
but weren't zeroing the variables first.



5.2  Relation between difference and constant <All>

A test of the form "<expr1> - <expr2> <relation>  <const>"  was  being
incorrectly  converted to "<expr1> <relation> <expr2> + <const>".  For
example, "IF .A - .B GTR 0 THEN" was converted to "IF .A GTR .B THEN".
This  looks  plausible, but certain overflow conditions invalidate it.
The only form of this optimization allowed now is "<expr1>  -  <expr2>
EQL/NEQ 0" => "<expr1> EQL/NEQ <expr2>".



5.3  Incorrect error messages <All>

Incorrect error messages were generated when the compiler  was  unable
to  read  a library or require file.  Also, the error message "PLIT or
INITIAL size exceeds implementation  limits"  was  not  generated  for
TOPS-10 BLISS-36.  These have been fixed.



5.4  PRESET with address of LOCAL variable <All>

When a local variable name occurred in a  PRESET  list,  the  compiler
generated an EXTERNAL reference for that name.  For example, "LOCAL A,
B :  BLOCK [3] PRESET ([0, 0, 32, 0] = A)" would result in "Undeclared
global symbol A" when it was linked.  This has been fixed.



5.5  Spurious "symbol previously declared" messages <All>

With /CHECK=REDECLARE, a spurious "symbol previously  declared  in  an
outer block" message was generated when a symbol was declared EXTERNAL
in an outer block, and GLOBAL in an inner block.  This has been fixed.



5.6  Flow analysis failure <All>

The compiler would fail in the flow  analysis  phase  when  confronted
with  certain extremely complex patterns of common subexpression usage
(involving nested IFs within LOOPs within IFs).  This has been fixed.
BLISS-36 Release 4A(236) For TOPS-20: Release Notes             Page 5


5.7  Bad code for the MOD operator <All>

The compiler would sometimes generate code for the MOD  operator  that
would  compute  a  result  with  the  wrong  sign.  In particular, the
compiler would sometimes compile "(-x) MOD (-y)" as "x MOD  y".   This
will now be compiled as "-(x MOD y)".



5.8  Cross-reference fixes <All>

Several   minor   problems   with   the   output   produced   by   the
/CROSS_REFERENCE qualifier have been fixed.



6.0  MISCELLANEOUS

7.0  CHANGES TO UNSUPPORTED TOOLS



                                 NOTE

               This section describes components of the
               BLISS  V4 release that are not supported                                          ___
               by DIGITAL.  These  items  are  provided                  _______
               only as a service to our users.


See the User's Guide for information concerning these tools.



8.0  CHANGES TO UNSUPPORTED SOFTWARE

As a courtesy to our users, some  unsupported  development  tools  are
shipped with the BLISS distribution.



8.1  XPORT - Transportable BLISS Programming Tools

A maintenance release of XPORT appears in the version 4A release.



8.2  SIX12 - BLISS Symbolic Debugger

Included in this release is  a  machine-readable  manual  -  SIX12.MEM
which serves as a reference manual for the debugger.

9.0  RESTRICTIONS

This section summarizes restrictions with the V4A(236) release.  Where
possible, temporary solutions are described.




PROBLEM:  The following code fragmentPROBLEM:

                d = 0;
                .....
                WHILE .d NEQ 0 DO
                    BEGIN
                    ....
                    x = 66 / .d;        ! Assume "d" never written
                    ...
                    IF .y THEN EXITLOOP
                    END

          will cause a zero-divide exception at  execution  time  when
          compiled  using  normal optimization.  The compiler believes
          that the expression "66/.d" is loop invariant and moves  the
          computation out of the loop.

SOLUTION: This is a restriction in V4A.  In this particular case,  theSOLUTION:
          expression could be rewritten as:

                WHILE 1 DO
                    BEGIN
                    .....
                    IF .d EQL 0 THEN EXITLOOP;
                    ....
                    x = 66 / .d;
                    .....
                    END;

          In this case, the expression cannot  be  moved  out  of  the
          loop.




PROBLEM:  Incorrect code generated for structure  definitions  of  thePROBLEM:
          form:

                STRUCTURE BAD[I,P,S]= [%UPVAL]
                    (IF .I THEN BAD ELSE BAD + .BAD<16,16>)<P,S>;

                OWN X: BAD[];
                LOCAL T;

                T = .X[.T,0,12];

          "X" is loaded into a register in the  THEN-branch,  but  the
BLISS-36 Release 4A(236) For TOPS-20: Release Notes             Page 7


          ELSE-branch uses the register without loading it.

SOLUTION: This is the result of a design flaw  in  the  way  structureSOLUTION:
          references  are  expanded.  BLISS semantics guarantee that a
          structure actual-parameter is evaluated only once.  This  is
          implemented  by treating the first occurrence of a structure
          formal  as  if  it  was  a  BIND  declaration.   The   other
          occurrences  of  the structure formal are then treated as if
          they were uses of the "imaginary" bind-name.  This choice of
          implementation  fails  when  the  first  occurrence  of  the
          structure formal is in conditional flow!  The problem can be
          avoided by insuring that the first occurrence of each formal
          is outside  of  conditional  flow.   The  example  structure
          should be written as:

                STRUCTURE GOOD[I,P,S] = [%UPVAL]
                    (GOOD; IF .I THEN GOOD ELSE GOOD+.GOOD<16,16>)<P,S>;

          Note that the  "structure-name"  is  the  zero-th  structure
          formal  parameter.  The formals "I", "P" and "S" are already
          outside  of  conditional  flow,  so   they   are   processed
          correctly.   This  change  will  cause  the  compiler to use
          slightly  more  memory,  but  the  resulting  code  will  be
          correct.   There  should  be  no  reduction  in optimization
          either.

          Be aware that there is no problem when the conditional  flow
          is  constant-folded  at  compile-time,  or  when there is no
          conditional flow in the structure body.
