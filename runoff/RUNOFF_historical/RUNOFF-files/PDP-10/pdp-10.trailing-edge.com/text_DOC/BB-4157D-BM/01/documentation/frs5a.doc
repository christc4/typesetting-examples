FOROTS-20 -- Changes from V5(620) to V5A(721)
October 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

FOROTS is the object time system that  provides  runtime  support  for
Fortran  programs, including monitor interface functions for I/O, core
management  and  error  handling.   FORLIB  is  the  Fortran   library
containing  the  mathematical intrinsic functions and various external
subroutines.

The reason for this release is to correct outstanding bugs for FORTRAN
support in FOROTS version 5.

FOROTS version 5A is FOROTS version 5 with  edits  #620  through  #721
inclusive.   This  version fully replaces versions 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4, 4A,
4B and 5.


1.1  Bibliography

FOROTS is documented in the FORTRAN-20 Programmer's  Reference  Manual
AA-4158B-TM.


1.2  Monitors

FOROTS will run on any monitor supported by DEC on the DECsystem-20.


1.3  Related System Software

The following system software must be used with the FOROTS system:


     FORTRAN any version

     LINK any version

     MACRO version 52

     MAKLIB version 2(20)

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Lower case letters are now accepted as FORMAT descriptors as they  are
already  acceptable  to  the  compiler.  Lower case letters for D or E
exponents and True or False logical constants are now accepted.

The PLOTS plotter subroutine will now take an optional second argument
which is the step size for the plotter involved.

The ALOG function has  been  rewritten  to  improve  the  accuracy  in
certain ranges.

When closing a file with DISPOSE='PRINT', the DEVICE= argument will be
used  as  the  queue  name  to  pass  to QMANGR.  It will NOT be error
checked.

Recovery from an ILLEGAL LSCW error  on  sequential  input  now  scans
forward  in the file until it finds a word which LOOKS LIKE (but can't
be guaranteed to be) a beginning LSCW to  position  the  file  at  the
beginning of the next record.

If the argument value of the OPEN/CLOSE keyword DIRECTORY is zero, the
connected directory will be used instead of the logged-in one.

A tape density of 6250 is now accepted.

With free-format O format, a double precision argument in  the  iolist
will input to and output from both words.

On magtape I/O, if no DENSITY= is present, FOROTS will  use  the  user
set or system default density.

The TRACE routine now works correctly when the subroutines in the CALL
history reside in OVERLAYs.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

FOROTS version 5 has the following deficiencies:

     A)  RANDOM ACCESS in DUMP mode is unimplemented in version  5  of
         FOROTS.   An  appropriate error message will be issued if any
         attempt is made to use RANDOM, RANDIN, or APPEND access  with
         DUMP  mode.  The user is advised to use IMAGE mode under such
         circumstances.

     B)  REREAD on a TTY device only rereads  at  most  the  last  150
         characters from the previous record.

     C)  FOROTS will not automatically handle multiple reel  files  on
         MAGTAPE.

     D)  IMAGE mode I/O does not work on TTY.

     E)  Encoding an array into the same array is not possible.   (The
         target array is first filled with blanks.)

     F)  FOROTS does not read line sequenced files directly.

     G)  RANDOM NUMBER generator routine fails if  it  is  initialized
         with a call to SETRAN with an argument of 2**31-1.

     H)  REREAD  will  not  work  with  spooled  devices  unless   the
         RECORDSIZE is a multiple or divisor of 128 words.

     I)  Attempting to do a control-C and then @CLOSE while a file  is
         open  for  RANDOM  I/O  will  cause lost data, extra spurious
         data, or ADDRESS CHECK FOR DEVICE.  The same problems can  be
         caused  by attempting to EXIT from a MACRO subroutine while a
         RANDOM access file is open.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The  installation  of  the  FOROTS/FORLIB  system   involves   copying
FOROTS.EXE  and  FORLIB.REL  from  the release tape.  If you desire to
assemble the FOROTS or FORLIB  sources,  a  FORPRM.UNV  file  must  be
created.   Assemble  (with  MACRO  50(272)  or  later) FORPRM.MAC with
FORCPU.20.

See the file FTN5A.FIG for information regarding installation.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The following is a list of all of the edits made to version 5(617)  in
producing version 5A.


#620   SPR-21396  Allow lower case letters in FORMAT descriptors.

#621   SPR-21149  Enforce fixed-length records in  IMAGE  mode.   This
                  will also fix RANDOM access in IMAGE mode.

#622   QAR-873    Fix NAMELIST partial arrays at end of list.

#623   SPR-21441  Use EXP2..  instead of EXP2.0 in FORPLT so  that  it
                  will  load if FORSIN was compiled with F40LIB turned
                  off.

#624   SPR-19860  Changes to DEXP.2, DEXP.3, EXP.3 for consistent
       SPR-20411  handling of negative  single  and  double  precision
                  numbers  to  non-integer  powers.   Also  rearranged
                  order of FORDBL.MAC by reversing position of  DEXP.2
                  and DEXP.3 to facilitate call from DEXP.3 to DEXP.2.

#625   SPR-none   Fixes to FORTRP for double  precision  zero  divide.
                  It  should  return plus or minus infinity, depending
                  on  the  sign  of  the  dividend.   4B(460)   always
                  returned  positive  infinity;  after patch 531, zero
                  was returned.

#626   SPR-none   Change data error 11 in ER%DAT in FORERR to  specify
                  NAMELIST name and invalid variable name.

#627   SPR-21476  Allow ^C and @CLOSE when APPENDing to a null file.

#630   QAR-951    Avoid IO to unassigned  channel  if  RENAME  UUO  to
                  delete a file with DISPOSE='DELETE' loses.

#631   SPR-21591  Fix SCALE in  FORPLT  so  XMIN  gets  set  right  if
                  INT(lowest  value/DX)=0,  and  prevent  zero divides
                  when  all  values
