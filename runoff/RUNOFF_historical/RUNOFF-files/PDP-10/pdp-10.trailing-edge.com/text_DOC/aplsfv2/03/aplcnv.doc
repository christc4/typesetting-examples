1.0  SUMMARY

The APL  Workspace  Interchange  Standard  (WSIS)  is  a  source-level
interchange  format  for  APL workspaces, agreed to by implementors of
APL and documented in the article "Workspace Interchange  Convention",
APL Quote-Quad, volume 9 number 3 of March, 1979.___ __________

This convention defines a tape  interface  that  enables  transfer  of
workspaces between vendors regardless of their internal APL formats or
size and content of their .BXAV's.  The contents of the  workspace  is
encoded  using .BXCR for functions and an equivalent for variables.  A
tape (whose characteristics are agreed to by both the sender  and  the
receiver) is written beginning with a "standard" representation of the
sender's .BXAV, followed by  the  workspaces  in  the  sender's  .BXAV
codes.   Other components of a workspace, such as groups, the SI stack
or APLSF files,  are  NOT  transferable  with  WSIS.   Certain  system
variables ARE transferred by DEC's implementation of WSIS.

The DEC implementation of WSIS consists of two APL  workspaces  and  a
MACRO  program:   workspace  WSOUT is used to create disk files of all
workspaces to be transferred;  program APLTAP on the -20 and TENTAP on
the -10 output these disk files to a mag tape in the "standard" format
to be read by the receiver and can read a sender's  "standard"  format
tape;  workspace WSIN reads a disk file created from the sender's tape
and produces workspaces useable by APLSF.

Because of the use of the APLSF file system, the Workspace Interchange
Standard  is  only  available  from  APLSF  on the DECsystem-10 or the
DECSYSTEM-20, but not from APL-BASIC (-10 nor -20).

Version 1 of WSIS runs under version 2 of APLSF under release 6.03A or
later of the TOPS-10 monitor and 3A or later of the TOPS-20 monitor.



2.0  OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

     1.  When generating a tape in the  WSIS  format  from  a  set  of
         workspaces,  the first step is to create a disk file for each
         workspace to be converted.  The .ZQ.ZQWSOUT function  in  the
         workspace   WSOUT  does  this.   The  following  sequence  of
         commands implements this step:

         run APLSF
         TERMINAL..TTY
               )LOAD <workspace1>
               )COPY WSOUT
APLCNV.DOC                                                      Page 3


               .ZQ.ZQWSOUT '<filename1>'
               )LOAD <workspace2>
               )COPY WSOUT
               .ZQ.ZQWSOUT '<filename2>'
         .
         .
         .

         In the above example,  "<workspace1>"  is  the  name  of  the
         workspace  to  be  transferred;  "<filename1>" is the name of
         the disk file to  be  created.   The  default  extension  for
         "<filename>"  is  ".ABI".   This  procedure  is done for each
         workspace to be written on the tape.

         WSOUT does not copy any variables or  functions  whose  names
         begin  with  .ZQ.ZQ  since those names are used internally by
         WSOUT.

     2.  The next step is to write the disk files onto a tape  in  the
         WSIS format.

         The characteristics of the magnetic tape,  such  as  density,
         parity,  record  length, format, presence of labels and label
         type, are outside WSIS.  These tape parameters must be agreed
         to  by  both  the  sender  and  the  receiver  in  order  for
         successful transfer to occur.

         1.  The procedure to write the tape under TOPS-20 is:

             @RUN APLTAP
             APLTAP!? one of the following:
              EXIT    INITIALIZE    READ    TERMINATE    WRITE
             APLTAP!INITIALIZE (TAPE) <tape>:
             APLTAP!WRITE (FILE) <filename1>
             APLTAP!WRITE (FILE) <filename2>
             .
             .
             .
             APLTAP!TERMINATE (WRITING ON THE TAPE)
             APLTAP!EXIT (TO MONITOR)
             @

             APLTAP uses the COMND  JSYS  on  the  -20  so  <ESC>  ($)
             recognition and completion and ?  (HELP) are available.

         2.  The TOPS-10 procedure is:

             .RUN TENTAP
             APLTAP!?
             ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
             R       READ A TAPE
             I       INITIALIZE A TAPE FOR WRITING
             W       WRITE A WORKSPACE DUMP ONTO TAPE
             T       TERMINATE WRITING A TAPE
             E       EXIT
APLCNV.DOC                                                      Page 4


             APLTAP!INITALIZE (TAPE) <tape>:

             APLTAP!WRITE (WORKSPACE DUMP) <filename1>

             APLTAP!WRITE (WORKSPACE DUMP) <filename2>
             .
             .
             .
             APLTAP!TERMINATE THE TAPE
             APLTAP!EXIT (TO MONITOR)
             .

             TENTAP accepts single letter commands  and  then  prompts
             for the rest of the command line automatically.

         "<tape>:"  is  a  magnetic  tape  device,   loaded   with   a
         write-enabled  tape.  "<filename1>", "<filename2>", etc.  are
         the disk files produced by .ZQ.ZQWSOUT.

         The tape is unlabelled with one file.  The  tape  is  written
         with  a  fixed blocksize of 1892 8-bit bytes.  The last block
         is padded with spaces.  If several workspaces are  dumped  to
         the  same  tape,  the "WSIS" and "TRANSLATE" pseudo-variables
         are not  rewritten  and  an  "END"  pseudo-variable  is  only
         written after the last workspace.

     3.  To transfer a tape written in WSIS format, the first step  is
         to convert the tape into a disk file.

         1.  The TOPS-20 procedure is:

             @RUN APLTAP
             APLTAP!READ (FROM TAPE) <tape>: (COMMANDFILE) <cmdfile>
             APLTAP!EXIT (TO MONITOR)
             @

         2.  The TOPS-10 procedure is:

             .RUN TENTAP
             APLTAP!READ FROM (TAPE) <tape>: <crlf>
              WRITING (COMMANDFILE) <cmdfile>

             APLTAP!EXIT (TO MONITOR)
             .

             Note that a carriage return-linefeed is  necessary  after
             specifying  "<tape>:"  in  the  R (read) command.  TENTAP
             will then prompt for the "<cmdfile>".

         This procedure creates a disk  file  named  "Wnnn.ABI"  where
         "nnn"  is  a  3-digit  decimal  number  (starting from "000")
         making the filename unique.  This name is embedded  into  the
         command file created for the next step.

         The <cmdfile> will be overwritten if it exists.
APLCNV.DOC                                                      Page 5


         A tape block may not exceed 4096 8-bit bytes in length.   The
         tape  may  not  be  a  multi-reel  volume.   If the tape is a
         multi-file volume, each file is  treated  as  an  independent
         file that must be in the WSIS format.

     4.  The next step is to convert the disk file to workspaces.  The
         command  file  generated by APLTAP or TENTAP contains all APL
         commands necessary.  NOte that APLTAP and TENTAP assume  that
         WSIN is on SYS:.

         run APLSF
         TERMINAL..TTY
               )INPUT <cmdfile>

         This procedure creates workspaces with the name from the WSIS
         tape  and  an extension of ".APL" in your connected directory
         on the -20 and in your default path on the -10.  If a file by
         that name already exists, WSIN creates an extension of ".Wnn"
         where "nn" is a 2-digit decimal number (starting  with  "00")
         making the filename unique.

         WSIN lists the function and variable names on the terminal as
         it  transfers  them from the input file to the workspace.  If
         you invoke  WSIN  using  the  above  ")INPUT"  command,  each
         function  name will be listed twice, once by WSIN and once by
         the .BXFX function that WSIN executes.  This is  a  "feature"
         of  APLSF:   when a function is defined from a )INPUT stream,
         either through the .DL syntax or .BXFX, the function name  is
         listed on the terminal.
