APLSF.DOC  -- Changes from V1C(315) to V2(435)
September 1979






1.0  SUMMARY

APLSF is the implementation on the DECsystem-10 of  the  APL  language
with shared system functions and system variables.  It runs on a KI-10
or KL-10 processor  under  release  6.03A  or  later  of  the  TOPS-10
monitor,  and  requires  VMSER  on  the  KI-10.   It requires no other
software modules during execution, and  is  documented  in  the  APLSF
Programmer's   Reference  Manual  (DEC-10-LPLSA-A-D).   Version  2  is
documented in the TOPS-10/20 APLSF Language Manual (AA-H200A-TK).

Version 2 runs under release 6.03A or later of  the  TOPS-10  monitor.
It has been tested in-house under 6.03A and 7.00.

The reason for this release is to correct outstanding  bugs  in  APLSF
Version  1C  and  to  incorporate  several  functional enhancements as
described below.

APLSF Version 2 fully supersedes Version 1C and includes edits #316 to
#435.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


     1.  The current setting of )MAXCOR is now saved across  a  )CALL,
         so  it is possible to return from a )CALL even if )MAXCOR had
         been expanded in the workspace before the )CALL.

     2.  There are now TTY mnemonics for diamond (.DM),  left  bracket
         (.LB),  left  tack (.LK), right bracket (.RB), and right tack
         (.RK).

     3.  Nonprinting elements of the atomic  vector  (.BXAV)  are  now
         displayed  as  squish  quad  (.SQ).   Note that this is not a
         valid character and cannot be typed to APL.

     4.  When doing APL output to an ASCII sequential  file  while  in
         TTY  mode,  the  default terminal type is now LA36 instead of
         2741.

     5.  Error numbers  are  now  catenated  to  the  front  of  error
         messages.   Also, the error line printed when an error occurs
         occasionally has fewer added spaces and the caret position is
         sometimes one position to the right of where it used to be.

     6.  It is now possible to open a PTY as an ASCII sequential file.
         As noted in the next item, lower case input will be converted
         to upper case just as with any ASCII  sequential  file.   The
         new  system  variable .BXTIMEOUT will be set if the input was
         not terminated with a line feed.

     7.  When doing TTY mode input from ASCII sequential files,  lower
         case characters are converted to uppercase (instead of random
         operators).

     8.  The omega function (.OM) has been removed from the version  2
         manual.   Omega  still  works  in  version  2 but will not be
         supported after version 2.  The .OM symbol has other proposed
         uses  in  the  APL  language and the optimizing effect of .OM
         will be implememted for reduce-iota-rho.

     9.  The definitions of  I-beams  (.IB)  have  been  moved  to  an
         appendix  of  the version 2 manual.  They are still supported
         in version 2 and  most  will  still  be  supported  in  later
         versions  for  compatibility with other vendors.  However, we
         strongly recommend that system  variables  and  functions  be
         used instead of I-beams.

    10.  Quote-quad (.QQ) or quad-del (.QD) input following .QQ or .QD
         output  precedes  the  input  string  with a string of blanks
         equal in length to the preceding output.  If  such  preceding
         output  was  longer  than  390  characters (the maximum input
         length), a LINE TOO LONG error occurs and  correct  input  is
         awaited.
APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 4


    11.  For  niladic  function  F  which  returns   no   value,   the
         expressions  "1;F", "1+F" and "F+1" give value errors since a
         value is needed by the  primitive  function  but  F  did  not
         return  one.  The expression "F;1" returns 1 to be consistent
         with the expression "F", which executes F but prints nothing.
         Note  that  the  ";"  function is a monadic output catenator,
         operating on  the  expression  to  its  right.   ";"  is  not
         intended to be a statement separator.




2.1  Functional Changes


     1.  The HIGH segment of APLSF has grown by about 11 pages.  Users
         should  monitor  their  memory use with version 2 and if they
         notice substantial performance loss due to  excessive  paging
         activity, they should ask their system administrator to raise
         the global physical page limit on the system.




2.2  Functional Additions

2.2.1  Error Trapping - The following system variables  and  functions
have  been  added  to  allow  program handling of error conditions and
other events.

     1.  .BXBREAK - This is a monadic function which causes  execution
         to  terminate,  suspending  the current function and entering
         immediate mode.  It prints its argument  before  breaking  to
         the terminal.

     2.  .BXERROR - This is a variable which is  set  by  APL  to  the
         error  message  for  the  last  error.  (It contains the text
         which is normally printed on the terminal.)

     3.  .BXSIGNAL - This is a dyadic function which signals an  error
         from the current function.  It causes the current function to
         terminate before generating the error.  Its right argument is
         either a valid APL error or a user defined error in the range
         500-999.  Its optional left argument is  the  message  to  be
         associated with the error.

     4.  .BXTRAP - This variable is similar to .BXLX.  It can  be  set
         to an expression which will be executed when an error occurs.

APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 5


2.2.2  Limiting Input Wait - The  following  two  variables  allow   a
program  to  limit  the  amount  of time a user is given to respond to
quote-quad or quad-del input.

     1.  .BXTIMELIMIT - The number of milliseconds to  wait  for  user
         input.  If 0, then no limit.  If -1, no waiting is done (only
         characters which were typed ahead are read).

     2.  .BXTIMEOUT - Flag indicating whether or not user timed out on
         last  input.   (This  flag is also used with PTYs to indicate
         whether or not last input was terminated with a LF).




2.2.3  New Character Arrays - The  following  system   variables   are
useful subsets of .BXAV.

     1.  .BXALPHA - The 27 letters, .LD-Z.

     2.  .BXALPHAU - The 27 underscored letters, .Z@-.ZZ.

     3.  .BXASCII - The 128 ASCII codes.   These  codes  are  sent  to
         files  as  is,  regardless  of  the  terminal type.  They are
         useful when doing graphics.

     4.  .BXCTRL - The 32 control characters, octal 0-37.

     5.  .BXNUM - The 10 digits, 0-9.




2.2.4  New File Functions -

     1.  .BXRENAME - This is a dyadic system function which  allows  a
         user to rename a file from within APL.  Its right argument is
         the channel associated with the file to be renamed.  Its left
         argument is the new filespec.

     2.  .BXAPPEND - This is a dyadic system function which  allows  a
         user  to  append data to /BU or /DA files.  Its left argument
         is the data item to be  appended  to  the  file.   Its  right
         argument  has  the  same  format  as the right argument to an
         output quad (.OQ)  and  specifies  how  the  data  is  to  be
         formatted in the file.

     3.  Two new file types, /AS* and /BS*, have been added  to  allow
         users  to append to ASCII and binary sequential files.  These
         file types are analogous to /IS*.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

3.1  Deficiencies And Restrictions

The known deficiencies and restrictions in APLSF are:

     1.  The  caret  symbol  indicating  where  an  error  in  an  APL
         statement  was  first  detected is sometimes displayed in the
         wrong position.  With the introduction of error trapping  and
         .BXERROR, it is desirable to fix this.  We will attempt to do
         so in the future.  With this in mind, we recommend that users
         do not write programs which depend on the current positioning
         of the caret.

     2.  It is not possible to display the trace or stop vector  of  a
         function.  This is a restriction which will not be removed in
         the foreseeable future.

     3.  It is impossible to  enter  an  invalid  TTY  mnemonic  in  a
         character  string  when  using  a TTY terminal, just as it is
         impossible  to  enter  an  illegal  overstrike  from  an  APL
         terminal.  This is a permanent restriction.

     4.  Monadic domino uses an inordinate amount of core.  This is  a
         deficiency  due  to  the  algorithm  used, which does monadic
         domino by simulating a dyadic domino with a left argument  of
         the  identity  matrix.   Thus,  it  must  construct  a double
         precision identity matrix.




3.2  Outstanding Bugs

The known outstanding bugs in APLSF are:


     1.  Erasing a pendent or a suspended function can cause a  SYSTEM
         ERROR, depending on the state of the function when erased.

     2.  The compression of a zero-by-n matrix returns a length  error
         when  the  left argument is an n-element vector, but works if
         it is a scalar.

     3.  A niladic branch inside a multistatement line will fail  with
         a SYNTAX ERROR.

The following two files are not distributed.  They  are  generated  by
APLSF.

     APLHSF.APL   The APLSF HI file, if a HI message is desired.

     ACCTSF.APL   The APLSF accounting file.

The default is to put APLSF.EXE and GENSF.EXE on SYS:[1,4],  APLSF.HLP
on HLP:[2,5], and BILING.1 on APL:[5,31].  There is no need to put the
files from the REL LIBRARIES saveset on disk.



4.2  Changing the Default Installation Parameters

The default installation parameters are as follows:

     The installation name is DECSYSTEM-10 APLSF.
     Two PPN's which differ only in the project number do  not  belong
          to the same programmer.
     The automatic save facility, .BXAUS, is off.
     The structure used for the HI file and the library is APL:.
     The name of the accounting file is ACCTSF.APL.
     The directory used for the accounting file is [5,31].
     The directory used for the HI file and the library is [5,31].
     The default value  of  )MAXCOR  (and  thus  the  default  maximum
          workspace size) is 20K.
     The default file protection for permanent files  is  000  (system
          standard).
     The default file protection for library workspaces is 100.

If a change in the parameters is desired, put the .EXE file on  device
DSK:, run GENSF.EXE and answer the questions.  The program updates the
.EXE file.  Then rename and distribute  the  different  files  to  the
appropriate disk structures and directories.



4.3  Creating a HI Message

If you wish a HI message,  login  under  [1,2],  sign  on  APLSF,  and
execute the command

     )HI 'THIS IS MY HI MESSAGE'

Then sign off APLSF.  This generates APLHSF.APL on the  structure  and
the directory specified for the )HI file by GENSF.

The )HI message is truncated to 239 characters.  The error message "WS
NOT  FOUND"  means that the )HI file directory specified by GENSF does
not exist.

6.0  SUGGESTIONS

6.1  Continuing a detached APL job

In the event of a line drop or system crash, a user's job  may  become
detached.  After reestablishing a connection with the system, the user
should check to see if his/her job is still there.  If  so,  the  user
should reattach to the job using the ATTACH command.  Then, to restore
the job to its previous state, the user should type CONTINUE.  If  the
user  instead  types  R APLSF, a new version of APL will be loaded and
the job's previous core image will be destroyed, along with the user's
workspace.

APLSF.OLD -- Changes from V1B(301) to V1C(315)
February 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

APLSF is the implementation on the DECsystem-10 of  the  APL  language
with shared system functions and system variables.  It runs on a KI-10
or KL-10 processor under release 6.03 or later of the TOPS-10 monitor,
and  requires  VMSER  on  the  KI-10.   It  requires no other software
modules during execution, and is documented in the APLSF  Programmer's
Reference Manual (DEC-10-LPLSA-A-D).

The reason for this release is to correct outstanding  bugs  in  APLSF
Version 1B.

APLSF Version 1C runs under release  6.03  or  later  of  the  TOPS-10
monitor.  It has been tested in-house under 6.03A and 7.01.

APLSF Version 1C fully supersedes Version 1B and includes  edits  #302
to #315.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  Functional Changes


     1.  GENSF can now be run  from  any  directory  instead  of  only
         [1,2].

     2.  Dyadic ! now gives results over a wider  range  of  arguments
         (e.g.   12!40).   It  also  computes  results when the second
         argument is less than zero, instead of returning 0 (it  still
         returns  zero  when  the  second  argument  is  less than the
         first).  Also, monadic ! not only gives results for  negative
         (non-integral) arguments, but the results are now correct.

     3.  When character strings containing embedded CRLFs are printed,
         trailing blanks before the carriage returns are removed.

     4.  Terminal characteristics are now restored appropriately  (the
         same way they are set on entry) when REENTERing or CONTinuing
         from CTRL/C.



2.2  Functional Additions


     None.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

3.1  Deficiencies and Restrictions

The known deficiencies and restrictions in APLSF are:

     1.  The caret symbol  indicating  where  an  error  in  an  APLSF
         statement  was  first detected is sometimes displayed too far
         to the left.  This is a design problem with the  interpreter,
         and there are no plans to fix it in the immediate future.

     2.  It is not possible to display the trace or stop vector  of  a
         function.  This is a restriction which will not be removed in
         the foreseeable future.

     3.  It is impossible to  enter  an  invalid  TTY  mnemonic  in  a
         character  string  when  using  a TTY terminal, just as it is
         impossible  to  enter  an  illegal  overstrike  from  an  APL
         terminal.  This is a permanent restriction.

     4.  Monadic domino uses an inordinate amount of core.  This is  a
         deficiency  due  to  the  algorithm  used, which does monadic
         domino by simulating a dyadic domino with a left argument  of
         the  identity  matrix.   Thus,  it  must  construct  a double
         precision identity matrix.  We will attempt to  correct  this
         deficiency soon.


3.2  Outstanding Bugs

The known outstanding bugs in APLSF are:


     1.  Erasing a pendent or a suspended function can cause a  SYSTEM
         ERROR, depending on the state of the function when erased.

     2.  The compression of a zero-by-n matrix returns a length  error
         when  the  left argument is an n-element vector, but works if
         it is a scalar.

     3.  A niladic branch inside a multistatement line will fail  with
         a SYNTAX ERROR.

     4.  If F is a niladic function which does not return an  explicit
         result, the construct ';F;' will give a VALUE ERROR.

     5.  The random link variable .BXRL cannot  be  set  equal  to  or
         greater than 2^27.  This will be fixed in version 2.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Included on this Tape

The APLSF system is composed of the following files:

     APLSF.DOC    This documentation file.

     APLSF.EXE    The APLSF executable file.

     GENSF.EXE    Generation program for APLSF.   See  below  for  its
                  use.

     APLSF.RNH    The HELP message to respond to the monitor HELP
     APLSF.HLP    command.  Put APLSF.HLP on HLP:[2,5].


     BILING.1     The APLSF workspace which processes the APL  billing
                  file.  Put it on the APL library area.

The following two files are not distributed.  They  are  generated  by
APLSF.

     APLHSF.APL   The APLSF HI file, if a HI message is desired.

     ACCTSF.APL   The APLSF accounting file.

The default is to put APLSF.EXE and GENSF.EXE on SYS:[1,4],  APLSF.HLP
on HLP:[2,5], and BILING.1 on APL:[5,31].


4.2  Changing the Default Installation Parameters

The default installation parameters are as follows:

     The installation name is DECsystem-10 APLSF.
     Two PPN's which differ only in the project number do  not  belong
          to the same programmer.
     The automatic save facility, .BXAUS, is off.
     The name of the accounting file is ACCTSF.APL.
     The PPN used for the accounting file is [5,31].
     The PPN used for the HI file and the library is [5,31].
     The default value of )CORMAX is 20K (thus,  the  default  maximum
          workspace size is 20K).
     The structure used for the HI file and the library is APL:.
     The default file protection for permanent files  is  000  (system
          standard).
     The default file protection for library workspaces is 100.

If a change in the parameters is desired, put the .EXE file on  device
DSK:, run GENSF.EXE and answer the questions.  The program updates the
EXE file.  Then rename and  distribute  the  different  files  to  the
appropriate disk structures and PPNs.

4.3  Creating a HI Message

If you wish a HI message,  login  under  [1,2],  sign  on  APLSF,  and
execute the command

     )HI 'THIS IS MY HI MESSAGE'

Then sign off APLSF.

313       -----     Version 1B didn't report KCS in the billing  file.
                    Fix it.

314       -----     Correct upper-lower case handling  when  resetting
                    terminal characteristics.

315       12787     Fix  AFUZZ   comparison   in   integer   to   real
                    conversion, broken by edit 224.
