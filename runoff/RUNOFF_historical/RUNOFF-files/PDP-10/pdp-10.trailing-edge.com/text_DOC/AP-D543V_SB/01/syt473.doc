SYSTAT.DOC -- Changes from V472(164) to V437(215)
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release supports all monitors  up  to  602.   It  supersedes  all
previous versions and answers all SPR's received before July, 1975.

Support for EXE crash files has been included.  A "SYS x" command will
look first for CRASH.EXE and if this lookup fails a lookup of the file
"CRASH.XPN" will be done.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile with C.UNV and JOBDAT.UNV on UNV:  and load with HELPER.REL on
REL:.  Place SYSTAT.SAV on SYS:  together with SYSTAT.HLP on HLP.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

151    SYS OCL did no longer work due to edit 145.

152    Use new format of num tab table starting with monitor load 722.

153    Use new DDB entry DEVJOB starting with load 722.

154    Use the length of a short DDB to calculate the address  of  DDB
       entry DEVFIL.

155    Use  TRMNO.UUO  to  determine  line  numbers  with  non  TOPS10
       monitors.
SYT473.DOC                                                      Page 3


156    The command sequence:

            .ASS DSK LPT
            .SYS /L/X

       resulted in the execution of an illegal UUO.

157    Replace  all  DDB  offsets  by  a  symbol  DV.XXX  to   prevent
       duplication of UUO names.

160    Never use a zero uptime to compute percentages.

161    Disk errors are reported wrong for a crash file.

162    Print system header immediately on a  SYS X  command,  as  this
       saves much time if one looks at the wrong crash.

163    Subtract the size of the monitors high segment  from  the  core
       size when free core is computed.

164    Old support for reading EXE crashes.

166    Add swapping space last message.

167    Increase remote station loop restriction.

170    Typing continue gives a logged in user of  SYSTAT  the  message
       "KJOB".

171    Typing a SYS X command gives the wrong date.

172    The value of UDB offset  UNIXRA  was  changed  in  602  causing
       extended writes and reads column to be wrong.

173    Ignore all packs and structures with:

          1.  zero mount count

          2.  pack not mounted

          3.  pack offline

          4.  zero reads and writes done.

174    SYS X will  give  an  error  message  when  a  non-disk  device
       contains the crash file.

175    Use universal JOBDAT file and request HELPER from REL.

20     Low segment size of programs with sharable hiseg is wrong.

143    Use C as a universal.

       of project 1.  [10-13028]

145    Make SYSTAT easier to interrupt with ^C, and allow continues if
       logged in.

146    Clear .UXTRM offset from a GETLCH to avoid problems with SYS:.

SYSTAT.DOC -- Changes from V471 to V472
June 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

Systat version 472 has been updated to run with 507 and 601  monitors.
In addition to this all know problems have been fixed.  Note that this
version uses a help file.

NOTE:  NO DATE 75 DEPENDENCY



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The V command will give "paged output".  This means that the user  has
to  force  the continuation of SYSTAT by typing random character, this
mode is intended for VT05 type terminals.

The X command accepts currently a file specification, note  that  this
specification  has  to  be separated from the X by either a slash or a
blank.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

SYSTAT currently uses a help file and requires the file HELPER.REL  to
be linked in the low segment.

See file SYSTAT.CTL for explicit instructions.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  Illegal memory reference problem.

     2.  SYS  .....  (many dots).

         No longer gives illegal memory reference or expands SYSTAT.

     3.  The PDB data for crash files is listed correctly.

     4.  SYS LEF no longer produces an empty file.
SYT472.DOC                                                      Page 8


     5.  Before writing the disk  file  SYSTAT.TXT  a  CHKACC  UUO  is
         performed to verify the write privilege.

     6.  Spooled devices are listed with a quote sign in the  operator
         output.

     7.  The amount of swapping space lost will be reported correctly.

     8.  Users will be warned, that no operator is on duty.

     9.  SYSTAT.HLP has been  updated  to  conform  to  the  507 - 601
         monitor.
