BOOTDX.DOC -- Changes from V1 to V2(15)
November 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOTDX is a bootstrap program which  is  used  for  loading  the  DX10
micro-code   from   the  DSK:.   BOOTDX  runs  in  user-mode  under  a
DECsystem-10 timesharing system.  It requires 2K of memory but expands
for  I/O  buffers.   BOOTDX does I/O instructions directly to the DX10
hardware.  For this to work, the BOOTDX job must have  privileges  for
the TRPSET function of the timesharing system.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

BOOTDX has been changed to read either .BIN files or  .A8  files.   It
also does an automatic clear before loading.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None outstanding.



4.0  INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS

The complete operating procedures for BOOTDX can be found in:

     a)  BOOTDX.RNO
     b)  BOOTDX.HLP



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Changed to read either .A8 or .BIN files



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
