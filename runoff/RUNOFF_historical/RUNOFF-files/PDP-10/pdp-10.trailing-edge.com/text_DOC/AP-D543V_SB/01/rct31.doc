REACT.DOC - Changes from Version 30A(143) to 31(154)


Copyright (C) 1973, 1974, 1975, by Digital Equipment Corporation



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 31(154) of REACT supports:

     1.  Scheduler Types for the DECsystem-10 6.02 monitor

     2.  ENQ/DEQ quota's

     An explicit description of these changes can be found in:

     1.  Software notebook 8 REACT specification

     2.  Software notebook 10 Run React

     (distributed with the August 1975 update).

Special attention should be paid to the  conversion  of  the  ACCT.SYS
file for which advice is given in the section external changes.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES



2.1  When converting a previous version of ACCT.SYS to version  4  the
value  for  the  Scheduler Type is defaulted to zero (0).  The ENQ/DEQ
quota is defaulted to 511.



2.2  The default values for the Scheduler Type and ENQ/DEQ  quota  can
be  changed  by reassembling REACT with the constant SIXDEF changed to
the correct value.  Bits 18-26 are the Scheduler Type, bits 27-35  are
the ENQ/DEQ quota.



2.3  To change the default value for spooling  priveleges  change  the
feature  test  switch FTSPOOL to some non-zero value.  This allows the
project-programmer number to SET SPOOL LPT.



2.4  The charge word default (word 14--CHGTAB)  has  been  changed  to
read  and  write  the  entry in SIXBIT instead of octal.  To interpret
this word as octal, the assembly switch DEFCHG must be changed to 0.

2.5  Error messages are now standardized beginning with either % or ?.



2.6  Upon reading a file, a message will report the actual  number  of
entries  and the maximum allowed.  This replaces the message reporting
the file being at least 90% full.



2.7  Updating ACCT.SYS

It is not recommended to update the "live" ACCT.SYS file, but if it is
done  the file will be read in "update mode" and kept open until it is
rewritten or an exit is being made.  This  will  lockout  simultaneous
updates.  This change introduces the following problem.

When the updater has enabled "NEW" then if ACCT.SYS exists only in the
real  SYS  area  (1,4)  then  it is necessary to use DSK:ACCT.SYS[1,4]
instead of SYS:ACCT.SYS.  In this situation REACT will issue a warning
and use DSK:ACCT.SYS[1,4] if the user advices him to do so.



2.8  Size of BIGREACT

If BIGREACT is defined then NPAIRS will be 1100 decimal.



2.9  PATCHES

REACT works as distributed.  However, since  it  causes  a  change  to
ACCT.SYS,  be sure that the proper versions of LOGIN and SPRINT-10 are
on SYS.  LOGIN should be in the field (Version 56A) but SPRINT-10 will
not  be  out  till late in the summer.  Therefore this patch should be
put in  SPRINT-10  before  running  REACT  to  make  version  four  of
ACCT.SYS.  At BILDC4 + 4 1/2 insert the following two lines of code:

                CAIN    C, 4            ;IS IT VERSION 4 OF ACCT.SYS?
                JRST    BILDC5-4        ;YES, GO PROCESS IT.

REACT.DOC - Changes from Version 30(24) to 30A(143)
January 1975


Copyright (C) 1973,1974,1975, by Digital Equipment Corporation



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 30A(143) of REACT supports:

     1.  IPCF quotas

     2.  Virtual memory quotas

     3.  New Watch features:  version and magtape.

     4.  Unit FS the RS04 disk.

     5.  Kont.type=RP, unit type=0 is the RH10 RP04.

An explicit description of these changes can be found in:

     1.  Software Notebook 8 (REACT Specification)

     2.  Software Notebook 10 (.Run REACT)



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES



2.1  Conversion of the ACCT.SYS File to Version 3

When converting a previous  version  of  ACCT.SYS  to  version  3,  we
recommend the following action:

     Before the ACCT.SYS file is  read,  use  the  D  command  to
     define  the defaults for IPCF quotas and virtual memory.  If
     this is not done the internal defaults will be used (2 and 5
     for IPCF quotas and 511,511 for virtual memory quotas).



2.2  Quota Definitions

Quotas can be  defined  either  by  means  of  the  D  command  or  by
explicitly  answering the COR question.  NOTE that the quota has to be
defined in decimal and not in octal as the documentation states.
RCT30A.DOC                                                      Page 4


2.3  Updating ACCT.SYS

Updating the "live" ACCT.SYS file is not recommended,  but  if  it  is
done  the file will be read in "update mode" and kept open until it is
rewritten or an exit is made.  This will lockout simultaneous updates.
This change introduces the following problem.

When the updater has "NEW:" enabled and ACCT.SYS exists  only  in  the
real  SYS:  area [1,4], then it is necessary to type DSK:ACCT.SYS[1,4]
instead of SYS:ACCT.SYS.  In this situation REACT will issue a warning
and use DSK:ACCT.SYS[1,4] if the user advises him to do so.



2.4  Size of BIGREACT

If BIGREACT is defined, then NPAIRS will be 1100 decimal.



2.5  Listing Output

The printout of IPCF and VM quotas is in decimal, this  was  octal  in
the previous version (edit 143).



2.6  Definition of IPCF and VM quotas

During the  definition  of  IPCF  and  VM  quotas  the  input  can  be
terminated by an altmode (edit 142).



2.7  RP04 Support

The insertion of RP04 units in STRLST is done by:

     1.  Answering the question "KONT TYPE:" with RP

     2.  Answering the question "UNIT TYPE:" with 0.



3.0  KNOWN DEFICIENCIES

4.0  Changes in Installation Instructions

The default values for  IPCF  and  VM  quotas  can  be  overridden  by
specifying them in a parameter file.  The symbols are:

     DFMXVM = max # of pages of Virtual memory    (default value 511)
     DFMXPP = max # of pages of physical core     (default value 511)
     DEFSND = default send quota                  (default value 2)
     DEFRCV = default receive quota               (default value 5)

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES



2.1  Conversion of the ACCT.SYS File to Version 3

When converting a previous version of ACCT.SYS  to  version  3  it  is
adviced  to  define  before the ACCT.SYS file is read the defaults for
IPCF quota and virtual memory, by means of the D Command.  If this  is
not  done  the  internal defaults will be used (2.5 for IPCF quota and
511,511 for virtual memory quota).



2.2  Quota Definitions

Quotas can be  defined  either  by  means  of  the  D  command  or  by
explicitly  answering the COR question.  NOTE that the quota has to be
defined in decimal and not in octal as the documentation states.
