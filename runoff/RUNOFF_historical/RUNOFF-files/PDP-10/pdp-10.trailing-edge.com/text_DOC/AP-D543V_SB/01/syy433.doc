SYSDPY.DOC -- Changes from V432 to V433(550)
September 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

The  F  display  logic  has  been  updated  to  support   large   disk
configurations by making the display pageable.

If a display with the auto roll feature off  uses  only  part  of  the
screen,  then  the  next  passes  will keep adding data to the display
until all lines are used.

Unprivileged users will have TTY line numbers displayed.

This release supports all  monitors  up  to  602  and  supersedes  all
previous versions.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile with C.UNV and JOBDAT.UNV on UNV:.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

EDIT #

507  On DC72 (DECSYNC version) a VT05B will not work at  a  2400  baud
     rate  as  0  fill  characters  disappear, this is due to the DC72
     being assembled with feature switch FTT OFN .NEQ.  0.

510  Display line numbers for unprivileged users by using  the  TRMNO.
     and DEVNAM UUO.

511  Start using the new format of "NUMTAB table" with load 721.

512  Start using the new devjob entry in DDB's.

513  Make the F display pageable.

514  Correct errors in 602 device logic.

515  Correct character input logic

516  Make C file a universal file.

517  Correct errors introduced by edit 513.

526  The PEEK facility was not recognized.

527  Do not display an empty F display.

530  Adapt to changed JUMPPT macro.

531  Unprivileged jobs get data for CPU1 on a single CPU system.

532  Add the monitor high segment size to the monitor size.

533  Search universal JOBDAT file for JOBDAT bymbols.

534  Jobs locked into core cannot refresh the screen.

535  Too many "DEV BY HOW" headers are printed when a display ends  at
     the bottom of a column.

536  D display hangs for an unpriviliged user

537  D display contains a right parenthesis between the W  column  and
     the swap ratio column.

SYY432.DOC -- Changes from V1 to V2
June 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of SYSDPY  supports  up  to  monitor  6.01  with  virtual
memory.  The main changes are:

     1.  SYSDPY uses less CPU time

     2.  A M display has been added

     3.  More help is supplied

Note:  No DATE75 dependency



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  M Display

The M display is activated by  typing  the  M  command.   The  display
consists of 2 sections:

     1.  General system information on the first 2 lines

     2.  A header line followed by job data

The general information displays on:

line 1 the system identification
     the current system paging rate
     (in page faults per second).

line 2 the maximum amount of available
     virtual memory and the amount
     currently in use.

The output format is:

     VM (MAX=XXX, USED=YYY)

The maximum paging rates for both the system and user in the format:

     PGR.(SYS=XXX, USER=YYY)

The accumulated page fault counts of page faults with page not in  the
working set (NIW) and the page faults with the page in the working set
(IW).  The format is:

     PFC NIW=XXX IW=YYY
SYY432.DOC                                                      Page 6


The job data displayed is very similar to the normal  display.   Three
new columns are added:

     1.  VIRT.  Under this heading is printed:

              LOW + HIGH(MAX) where:

         LOW=size of low segment if job is virtual else 0

         HIGH=size of high segment if job is virtual else 0

         MAX=maximum possible amount of virtual core.

     2.  PHYS.  Under this heading the physical guideline is printed.

     3.  PGR.  Paging rate in page faults per second.


2.2  Additional Help Messages

A set of additional displays have been added to  inform  the  user  of
restrictions  to  which  he is subjected.  An unprivileged user cannot
run the F display as he lacks SPY or PEEK privileges.  All these  help
texts are automatically replaced by the normal display.


2.3  Screen Updating

The updating of the screen is done  in  one  pass  and  no  longer  by
updating the left half followed by the right half.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  The construction of the display image has  been  considerably
         sped  up by taking out unnecessary code and replacing GETTABs
         by SPY and PEEK operations is possible.

     2.  Swap error counts were computed in the wrong way.
