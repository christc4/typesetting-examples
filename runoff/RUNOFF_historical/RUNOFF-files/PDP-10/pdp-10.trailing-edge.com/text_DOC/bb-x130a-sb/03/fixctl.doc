This quick FASBOL program is designed to convert the old syntax of
the /VID switch to MOUNT to the new syntax of /REMARK. Also, any
VIDs in single quotes (') MUST be converted into double quotes (").
Thats what this program does.

It takes as input, a command file where each line is a file spec of
the CTL file to convert (such as is produced by DIRECT/INDIRECT).

Restrictions:
	1) SFDs are NOT supported
	2) The CTL is superseded in place
	3) All dates on all CTL files processed will be todays date
