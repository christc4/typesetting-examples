PATH.DOC -- Monitor level SETSRC commands and enhancements
March 1983



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of PATH adds support for  the  expanded  use  of  logical
names supported by the 7.02 monitor.

PATH has been tested on KS and KL processors under the 7.02 version of
the  monitor  and supersedes all previous versions.  It will run under
earlier versions but certain types of logical name commands will fail.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The logical name facility has been enhanced to provide an interface to
the  new  logical  name support in the 7.02 monitor.  See PATH.HLP for
more details.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See PATH.CTL, and PATH.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

1      The sequence .PATH<CR> .CONTINUE<CR> caused I/O  to  unassigned
       channel.  Make CONTINUE act the same as REENTER.

2      Change the logical name code to know about the new  format  for
       the logical name block.

3      If PATH gets an error return trying to do a  /CLEAR,  it  loops
       forever  retrying the UUO.  Give up with an appropriate message
       if the /CLEAR fails

4      If /PHYSICAL is applied to any  component  in  a  logical  name
       definition,  PATH  will  ignore  any  existing  logical name in
       performing the substitution for the component.

5      In search list switches where  the  user  types  a  *  with  no
PATH.DOC                                                        Page 3


       modifiers (e.g., NOCREATE), keep the existing modifier bits for
       each structure represented by the *.

6      APLSTK was AOBJNing on the wrong AC sometimes causing  a  loop.
       Correct the AC.

7      "pa/mod:dskb:write" (note  the  lower  case)  would  result  in
       "?PTHUSM   Unknown  structure  modifier  7RITE".   Call  .SIXSW
       instead of .SIXSC.

10     Change the job search list before changing the default path  so
       the  user  can  do  both in the same command if the SFDs in the
       path only exist on the structure being added.

11     Change the processing of /SEARCH and /LIB to  reflect  the  new
       monitor algorithm.

12     Change the search list switch processing  routines  to  do  the
       REMOVEs  then  the  ADDs  and finally the MODIFYs.  This allows
       commands of the form .PATH/REM:DSKG/ADD:DSKG which causes  DSKG
       to be moved to the end of the current search list.

13     Change the definition of logical names to allow  filenames  and
       extensions  to  be  specified.   Also  implement  /OVERRIDE and
       /COMMAND.

14     If the user specifies no path in  a  component  for  a  logical
       name,  zero  the  PPN word of the component in the logical name
       block and let the monitor fill it in.

15     If the user defined a logical name with the  [,...]  construct,
       type  the  logical name back at him with [,] instead of filling
       in the PPN.

16     Remove the /COMMAND function since  that  is  now  provided  by
       another program.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
