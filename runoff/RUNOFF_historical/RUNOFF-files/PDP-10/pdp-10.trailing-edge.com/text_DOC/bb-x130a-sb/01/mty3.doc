1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of this release is to correct problems when attempting  to
duplicate FRS format mag tapes.  This version also adds the ability to
copy a specific number of files and to position the tapes  before  and
after the operation.

This version of MTCOPY must be loaded with  HELPER.   No  deficiencies
have  been  reported to earlier versions.  This release implements the
suggestion of being able to copy FRS tapes and defends against records
longer than the maximum it can handle.  It has been tested on 5.06 and
5.07.  MTCOPY has no DATE75 dependencies.

MTCOPY is documented in its .HLP file.

The purpose of MTCOPY is to copy one or more files of a mag tape.  The
default  is  to copy and verify an entire tape.  It can copy or verify
or both any set of files on a tape.  The user is  given  control  over
tape positioning and densities.
