 1   Introduction _   ____________

     The COJOB  facility  gives  the  user  the  ability  to  request  immediate
     execution  of  a  MIC macro as a separate job.  The COJOB is logged in on a
     PTY by the MIC  master  process  under  the  same  PPN  as  the  requestor.
     Transactions on the PTY are written to the specified log file.

     A COJOB request is entered by a command of the form

     .COJOB LOGSPEC/SWITCHES=<MACRO-SPEC> <ARGUMENTS>

     where

     LOGSPEC     is the specification of the MIC log file
                 (see section 2)

     SWITCHES    control the various COJOB options
                 (see section 3)

     MACRO-SPEC  is the specification of the MIC command file in the
                 usual format
                 (see MIC documentation)

     ARGUMENTS   are the arguments to the MIC command file
                 (see MIC documentation)

     The description of the COJOB request is continued in section 4.



 2   Log Specification _   ___ _____________

     The specification of the log file for a COJOB is of the form

     DEV:FILNAM.EXT[PATH]

     where any or all of these may be omitted,  and  a  standard  default  value
     used.  The standard defaults are

     DEV      DSK
     FILNAM   the same as the macro file
     EXT      Lnn - where nn is a two digit number
              forming a unique filename.ext
     PATH     the initiator of the COJOBS project
              programmer number

     Example

     To run the macro command file "FRED.MIC" the user could use the command

     .COJOB=FRED

     and use all defaults.
     MIC COJOBS - CONCURRENT JOB FACILITY                                 Page 4
     University of York - April 1983


     This is equivalent to using

     .COJOB DSK:FRED.L00/TIME:60=FRED

     Note:  A convenient way of running a COJOB and producing no log file
     is:

     COJOB NUL:=MACROFILE



 3   COJOB switches _   _____ ________

     The switches given in a COJOB control the running  of  the  COJOB  and  the
     disposal of the log file.  Currently the switches available are

     TIME   Time limit for cojob
     TAG    Start COJOB at a label
     [NO]OPTION  select a SWITCH.INI option
     [NO]LOPTION select a SWITCH.INI option at LOGIN.

     Note:  COJOB switches may be included in a SWITCH.INI line labelled thus:

     COJOB   /switches
     or
     COJOB:optionname/switches
     if a /OPTION:optionname switch is used.
                 

     3.1   TIME switch     ___   ____ ______

     This switch controls the run-time for the COJOB, and has the format

     /TIME:n

     where

     n is the run-time for the COJOB given in the form

     n = s seconds                           e.g. /TIME:5
     n = mm:ss - minutes:seconds             e.g. /TIME:3:30
     n = hh:mm:ss - hours:minutes:seconds    e.g. /TIME:1:30:25
     n = sk - s*1000 seconds                 e.g. /TIME:5k

     The default run-time is currently 60 secs, though this may change.

     The system operator may also set a maximum value for this switch, which the
     user  may  not exceed.  If he attempts to exceed this value he will receive
     the message described in Appendix A.2 and his switch value will be reset to
     the maximum value.


     3.2 TAG Switch This switch specifies that the COJOB is to  start  execution     ___ ___ ______
     at the label given as argument to the switch.  The format is -

        /TAG:labelname
     MIC COJOBS - CONCURRENT JOB FACILITY                                 Page 5
     University of York - April 1983


     3.3 [NO]OPTION switch This is the usual switch that controls the processing     ___ __________ ______
     of SWITCH.INI entries.


                                        NOTE

         The COJOB SWITCH.INI line is labelled COJOB.




     3.4 [NO]LOPTION switch This switch controls the option  to  be  selected  a     ___ ___________ ______
     COJOB  LOGIN,  thus  the  switch  /NOLOPTION  would  cause the LOGIN switch
     /NOOPTION to be used.




 4   COJOB request - contd. _   _____ _______ _ ______

     If a COJOB request is successful the user will be informed thus

     [COJOB <name> (macroname) started, log file is DEV:NAME.EXT[PATH]]

     where

     <name> is a one letter  name  assigned  to  the  COJOB  for  identification
     purposes.

     (macroname) is the COJOB job name, normally the same as the FILNAME part of
     the <macro-spec>.

     If a COJOB request is unsuccessful the user will receive

     [No COJOBS available]

     or an appropriate error message.



 5   COJOB messages _   _____ ________

     When a COJOB finishes its run the user is informed by

     [COJOB <name> (macroname) complete]

     and a record of what was performed  by  the  COJOB  may  be  found  in  the
     logfile.

     Other messages which may be output during the running of the COJOB are

     [COJOB <name> (macroname)[ABORT]] If the user  has  included  a  MIC  ABORT
     statement in the command file.

     [COJOB <name> (macroname)[ABORT ON ERROR]] If an error condition  has  been
     detected.
     MIC COJOBS - CONCURRENT JOB FACILITY                                 Page 6
     University of York - April 1983


     [COJOB <name> (macroname).PLEASE<MESSAGE>] If a  PLEASE  command  has  been
     included.

     [COJOB <name> (macroname)[BREAK]] If a MIC BREAK has been performed.
     (To proceed after this message see COJOB control commands)

     [COJOB <name> (macroname)[PROCEED]] If a COJOB has been proceeded  after  a
     break.

     [COJOB <name> (macroname) waiting ...] This message  is  output  every  two
     minutes  (approx.)  after  a MIC BREAK has been performed and the COJOB has
     not been PROCEEDed
     (N.B.  A similar comment appears in the log file.)

     [COJOB <name> (macroname)[?time limit exceeded]]
     This message is output when a COJOB  has  run  out  of  time.   After  this
     message has been output the COJOB is allocated 10% of its original time and
     allowed to proceed as if any error had occurred.

     [COJOB <name> (message) - Enter Parameter B]
     The message reflects the prompt which the use  has  used  in  a  MIC  INPUT
     statement.  The COJOB suspends until the user replies using a TYPE or ENTER
     command.

     These messages all have a correspondence with normal MIC  messages  and  in
     fact the normal MIC message will normally appear in the log file.


     Note

     1   If a COJOB owner logs off while his COJOB  is  still  running  no  more
     messages  will  be  sent  to  the  owner's  TTY  by the COJOB.  Instead the
     following message will be inserted in his log file

     [COJOB owner not available - continuing]

     and execution of the COJOB will continue.

     Also, should the owner log out the COJOB will be  prevented  from  entering
     "break" mode.

     2   Similarly, if a COJOB owner logs off while his COJOB is in BREAK  mode,
     this  will  be  detected  at  the "Waiting ..." stage and the COJOB will be
     continued as in note 1.



 6   COJOB control _   _____ _______

     The COJOB owner (or the operator) may issue control commands to a
     COJOB using the following command string

     .COJOB <name>-<CONTROL-COMMAND>

     where
     MIC COJOBS - CONCURRENT JOB FACILITY                                 Page 7
     University of York - April 1983


     <name> is the COJOB as section 5.

     <control-command> is one of the following

     WHAT           - to receive information of the status of the
                      COJOB.

     CANCEL         - to kill the COJOB i.e. cause it to log out.

     BREAK          - to cause the COJOB to enter break mode.
                      (cf. MIC BREAK and ^B for normal MIC's)

     PROCEED        - to cause a COJOB to continue after a break.
                      (cf. MIC PROCEED and ^P)

     ABORT          - to stop the currently running mic process.
                      (cf. MIC ABORT and ^A)

     PLEASE message - to display the "message" on the COJOB
                      owner's terminal.

     If an invalid <CONTROL-COMMAND> has been given, or the user  has  tried  to
     issue  a  <CONTROL-COMMAND>  to  a  COJOB  that  does not belong to him the
     message

     %CONTROL COMMAND "<CONTROL-COMMAND>" NOT VALID FOR COJOB <NAME>

     will be output.


     Note

     1   <CONTROL-COMMANDS> are not valid when a cojob  is  in  the  process  of
     logging out or logging in.

     2   The system operator may give  any  of  the  <CONTROL-COMMANDS>  to  any
     COJOB, even those not owned by him.



 7   COJOB commands _   _____ ________

     As well as the COJOB control commands, a COJOB owner may  issue  any  other
     MIC command on behalf of the COJOB.  Example

     .COJOB A-LET C="ABCDE"

     sets the parameter C in the COJOB to contain the string "ABCDE"

     Similarly, most other MIC commands may be given to a COJOB.

     University of York - April 1983


 8   IF extensions for the COJOB user _   __ __________ ___ ___ _____ ____

     The IF command has been extended to provide a means  whereby  a  MIC  macro
     command may determine if it is a COJOB or not.

     The command has the format

     .IF (COJOB).ANY MONITOR OR MIC COMMAND

     and the interpretation of the command is the  same  as  in  the  normal  IF
     command.  (See MIC documentation.)



 9   MIC SET command _   ___ ___ _______

     There is a separate set of MIC SET commands whose action  applies  only  to
     COJOBS.

     This command is described in the MIC documentation.

     The command format is

     .MIC SET <no> <action>

     where the available actions are

     .MIC SET NO TIMESTAMP
     Turns off timestamping of the log file.

     .MIC SET TIMESTAMP
     Turns timestamping on.

     .MIC SET LOGNONE
     Stops MIC logging COJOB activity.

     .MIC SET LOGALL
     Restarts logging (and timestamping)

     Note

     1   the two commands

     .MIC SET NO LOGNONE
     .MIC SET NO LOGALL

     do have the expected effect, but are normally not necessary.

     2   the default settings are

     .MIC SET TIMESTAMP
     .MIC SET LOGALL
                                                                    Page Index-1

COJOB command

As well as all the error messages which may be generated during a  "/"  command,
the following are specific to the COJOB command.

A.1   Fatal error messages


?MICCJN COJOBS not available at this time
The system operator has said that COJOBs are not available for remote users.

?MICCLD cannot INIT log device
The logging device specified by the user is in error.

?MICCLF cannot LOOKUP log file
A LOOKUP UUO performed on the user's specified log file failed for  some  reason
other than the file not existing.

?MICELF cannot ENTER log file
The specified log file could not be created.

?MICELS error in log file spec
The specification of the log file given by a user was invalid.   Normally,  this
error is due to incorrect syntax.

?MICECR error in COJOB request
A syntax error was detected in the "COJOB" command, most probably in one of  the
user's switches.

?MICNCA No COJOBS available
All the COJOB slots are in use


A.2   Non-fatal error messages

%MICSAE switch value exceeds maximum value
A switch (e.g.  the TIME switch) has an argument larger than some preset maximum
value  (defined  by the system).  The user's argument is replaced by the mimimum
value.
