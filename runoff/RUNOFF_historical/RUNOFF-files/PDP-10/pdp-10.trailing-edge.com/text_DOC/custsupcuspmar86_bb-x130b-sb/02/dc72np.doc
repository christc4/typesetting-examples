1.0  SUMMARY

This document reflects the software as of version 5.

The purpose of this release is to support  the  6.02  release  of  the
TOPS10  monitor.   The DC72NP code executes in a DC72NP remote station
for the DECsystem-10.



2.0  ASSEMBLING THE DC72NP CODE

DC72NP code is assembled from 2 files, C.PAL and DC72NP.PAL.  C.PAL is
a  configuration  file  which  is supplied by the user.  DC72NP is the
actual DC72NP source code.


2.1  C.PAL for a DC72NP

For a DC72NP a typical configuration file would be:

     PDP8=2                   /DEFINES THIS IS AN PDP8E
     TTYN=20                  /DEFINES THERE ARE 16 TTYS PLUS CTY
     OURNNM=15                /DEFINES NODE NUMBER FOR DC72NP TO BE 15
     DEFINE DC72ID "F;"O;"O>  /DEFINES DC72NP NODE NAME


2.2  Assembling DC72NP code

Typical commands to assemble the DC72NP code are:

     .R PAL10
     *DC72NP.BIN,DC72NP.LST/C=C.PAL,DC72NP.PAL



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Place the  DC72NP  binary  file,  which  resulted  from  the  assembly
described in 2.2 above, on SYS:  and then load it into the DC72NP with
NETLDR.   Typical  command  dialogues  with  NETLDR   are   given   in
NETLDR.DOC.
