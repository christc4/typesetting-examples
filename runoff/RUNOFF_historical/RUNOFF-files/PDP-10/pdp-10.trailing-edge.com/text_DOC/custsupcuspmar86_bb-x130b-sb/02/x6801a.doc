X680.DOC -- Version 1A
April 1971



1.0  CHANGES

Version-1  Update-A

The restart procedure has been changed:

If for any reason X680 needs to be initialized (e.g.,  after  a  halt)
with active users connected, perform the following steps:

     1.  Press STOP to stop the 680I.

     2.  Put 0001 in the switches and load address

     3.  Put 5405 in the switches and deposit

     4.  Reset the switches to desired starting address and continue

NOTE -- Users of P680.PAL versions before Update-A will also  have  to
deposit 200 in location 0005 after the deposit in location 0001.



2.0  DEFICIENCIES

Version-1  Update-A

In the configuration file  (see  680DES.RNO),  do  not  specify  Modem
Control  (MODCON=1)  unless you actually include some lines with Modem
Control (Remote or Modem) in the lines element.



3.0  COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

     1.  M680.MAC and configuration file must be assembled with  MACRO
         V.44 and loaded with LOADER V.52.

     2.  Always use Image Mode (PIP switch /I) when transferring  .BIN
         or .RIM files (e.g., L680.RIM).

     3.  X680 will  run  with  all  PDP-10  monitors  subject  to  the
         following considerations:

               X680A    L680

         4S72  (1) (2)   (3)


         5S01  (1) (2)   (3)
X6801A.DOC                                                      Page 3


         5S02  (2)        --

         5S03   --        --

         a.  These monitors do not support data-set control, therefore
             if  you  have data-sets, use the consol TTY to enable all
             data-sets (7777A) and run  with  Modem  Control  disabled
             (Switch-10 = 1).  Note -- There will be no auto-detach on
             data-set disconnects since this is again  a  function  of
             the PDP-10 monitor.

         b.  Restarting or  reloading  the  PDP-10  monitor  does  not
             restart X680 with these monitors.

         c.  These monitors do not support image-mode teletype  output
             and  therefore  the  PDP-10  to 680I loader mode will not
             work.  The ASR-33 mode will still work but it is the same
             as the standard binary loader.
