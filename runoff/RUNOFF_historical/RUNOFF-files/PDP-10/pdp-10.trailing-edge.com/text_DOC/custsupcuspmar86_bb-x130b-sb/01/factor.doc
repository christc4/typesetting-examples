FACTOR.DOC -- Changes from V1(3) to V1A(11)
September 1983



1.0  SUMMARY

FACTOR contains all the FACT-file related code  necessary  for  LOGIN,
and is unsupported (Category C) except to the extent necessary to make
supported products (LOGIN ) work.

FACTOR has been tested with LOGIN V61 under TOPS10 version 7.02.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

LOGIN now must be linked with  FACTOR.REL.   Installations  using  the
distributed  .CTL  files  to  build  these  programs should require no
changes in procedures.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

4      If a FACT file exits on a full  structure  and  DAEMON  is  not
       running  the  date of the FACT file may get changed to 5-Jan-75
       or undated depending on the edit level  of  the  monitor.   SPR
       10-26315.

5      Change FACTOR to search MACTEN and UUOSYM instead of C.

6      Generate symbols for Major Version,  Minor  Version,  Edit  and
       Who,  and  use  a  macro  to  generate  the title line so as to
       include the version and edit numbers.

7      /BAH 29-April-80 QAR  10-03781  DETFLG  is  referenced  without
       indexing  by  B, destroying a random word in the low segment if
       the job is detached and DAEMON is not running.

10     (SPR 10-28831)/FRS 29-April-80 check to  see  if  job  you  are

       trying to attach to is DAEMON and is [1,2].  If so, skip trying
       to write fact entry.

11     29-Sep-83 /DPM .CLNAM macro has bugs.  Remove it and use TITLE.
       from MACTEN.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

This section is for informational  purposes  only.   Since  FACTOR  is
unsupported,  the  only  use of it for which DEC can be responsible is
when called by field-image versions of LOGIN.

FACTOR  allocates  its  own  low  segment  space.   It  preserves  all
registers  except  AC 6.  It types all necessary error messages on the
job's controlling terminal unless the job is running detached.  FACTOR
expects  AC  17  to  point to a stack at least 25 locations deep.  The
only entry point is called .FACTR.  To call it,  load  AC  6  with  an
AOBJN  pointer  to  the  FACT  file  entry to be made, and call with a
PUSHJ.  FACTOR first tries to write the entry by calling DAEMON with a
DAEMON  UUO.  If that fails, it tries writing directly to device STD:.
If FACT.SYS can't be written, FACTOR then  tries  FACT.X01,  FACT.X02,
and so forth up through FACT.X77.  If all such files cannot be written
an error message is typed on the job's controlling terminal.

       MOVE    6,[AOBJN pointer to FACT file entry]
       PUSHJ   17,.FACTR##
         always return here

FACTOR.DOC -- V1
August 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a  new  module  which  contains  all  FACT-file  related  code
necessary for LOGIN.  This module is being released to ease the change
to USAGE file accounting by segregating  all  accounting-file  related
code  into  a  single  module,  and  to improve the maintainability of
programs which call it.   This  module  is  unsupported  (Category  C)
except  to  the  extent  necessary to make supported products (LOGIN )
work.

The following CUSPs or later must be used with FACTOR V1:

     MACRO version 50 or 52
