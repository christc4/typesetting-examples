1.0  SUMMARY

This version cleans up some minor bugs  and  adds  the  system  serial
number and monitor header line to each gripe recorded.

No SPRs have been received.  There are no  known  deficiencies.   This
version  runs  on  all  monitors and has been tested on 6.01/5.07.  It
fully supports the DATE-75 project.

GRIPE is  documented  in  the  monitor  commands  manual  and  in  the
programming specification GRIPE.

2.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

35   Add the monitor header line and the processor  serial  number  to
the  heading.  This allows better tracking of complaints in a multiple
system operation.

36   Change the sign-on help message  to  "depress  key"  rather  than
"type",  because  occasionally  we  have  noticed  a frustrated novice
typing the word "escape" over and over.

37   Change to assemble using C.MAC as a universal file.

40   Defend against the program being run at its CCL entry point.   It
will now behave the same as if started at its normal entry.

41   Don't list ^Z in the complaint file when  the  user  uses  ^Z  to
terminate his input.

42   Defend against possible junk by having the radix  output  routine
handle negative numbers correctly.

43   Correct a bug in the time output routine which  resulted  in  the
wrong time being indicated.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Assemble with C.MAC as a universal file.  This can be  done  be  using
the command:
     .LOAD U.MAC+C.MAC,GRIPE.MAC
with the file U.MAC containing %.C==-3.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Add the ability to handle an indirect file.

Add the ability to take back a previous complaint.

Teach GRIPE how to handle various special kinds of requests,  such  as
generating an SPR.

Develop some input other that ESCape or  ^Z  to  terminate  the  text.
This will make it more convenient to use from 2741-like devices.
