1.0  SUMMARY

COPY is a temporary conversion aid.  The old COPY program for  copying
DECtapes  has  been renamed DTCOPY.  The only function of Version 7 of
COPY is to print a message warning users of the change of name.  After
typing  the  message,  COPY  does a RUN UUO on DTCOPY.  The message is
intentionally verbose in order to force users to get into the habit of
calling DTCOPY directly.

COPY works on all supported monitors.  It has been tested under 5.06B.
Version  7  of  COPY  is  a  temporary  conversion  aid.   It  will be
distributed only for  a  brief  period  to  facilitate  conversion  to
DTCOPY.   The  save file will be distributed, but the source code will
not.  DTCOPY Version 7 replaces all previous versions of COPY.

DTCOPY is documented in the Software  Notebooks.   COPY  will  not  be
documented anyplace other than this DOC file.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

COPY no longer copies DECtapes.  It merely types a message  and  calls
DTCOPY.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Put Version 7 of COPY on SYS:  only after installing DTCOPY Version  7
(or  later)  on SYS:.  remove COPY version 7 from SYS:  after allowing
users several months to adjust to the new name.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

COPY Version 7 is a complete change from previous versions.
