SYSINF.DOC -- Changes from V3A(306) to V3B(322)
August 1984



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of this release is to fix several bugs which were reported
in   version  3A.   Several  sections  of  the  code  underwent  major
modifications during this effort.

Version 3B is the last planned release of  SYSINF.   The  [SYSTEM]INFO
facility  has  been  moved  to  QUASAR  for  the 7.03 monitor release.
SYSINF will not work under  7.03  monitors.   However,  as  a  monitor
conversion  aid, SYSINF V3B will check the monitor version at startup,
and will terminate under 7.03 without becoming [SYSTEM]INFO.

SYSINF is supported only as  a  monitor  conversion  tool.   No  other
support commitments have been made or implied.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

A new message has been added, which will appear when SYSINF is started
under a 7.03 monitor:
    ??(SYSINF) Deferring the [SYSTEM]INFO facility to QUASAR for 7.03

After typing this error message, SYSINF will perform an  EXIT,  unless
it  was  running  on  the force line (FRCLIN).  It will detach and run
logout if it discovers this error while running on FRCLIN.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs in version 3B of SYSINF.

SYSINF does not work  under  7.03  monitors,  but  this  will  not  be
addressed  in  the  SYSINF  program.   SYSINF has been replaced by the
QUASAR module QSRINF for the 7.03 release.  SYSINF is  only  supported
as  a  monitor  conversion  tool (to enable running GALAXY-10 V5 under
7.02).  No other support commitments have been made or implied.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

        .COMPILE INFSYM.MAC,INFLIB.MAC,SYSINF.MAC
        .R LINK
        *@SYSINF.LNK

SYSINF.EXE will then be ready to be placed on SYS:.

          history section of the source code of SYSINF.
