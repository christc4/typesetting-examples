                                     GENERAL



      1.1  PURPOSE.

      This document is a guide used by MFG to run  acceptance  on  1090  and
      1091  systems  using  KLAD10-7.04.   It  will  describe  starting  the
      acceptance, getting error reports and cleaning the pack when done.

      This will not discuss error analysis or criteria for shipment.



      1.2  SCOPE

      The acceptance scripts are designed to test the KL10 kernel only.  The
      scripts    described   in   this   document   will   only   test   the
      CPU,CI20,NI20,RPA0 and a lineprinter.  Any other peripherals will have
      to  be  run under TOPS-20 (UETP).  The default monitor SYSTEM.EXE will
      support these devices.  It is not necessary to run MONGEN on the KLAD.
      Unless you are sure of what you are doing DON'T run it.



      1.3  RELEASE NOTES

      1.3.1  DFKDA Problem

      There is still a problem with DFKDA.   It  fails  user  mode  doing  a
      divide  instruction  when  certain  base  numbers  come up.  This is a
      intermitent problem  and  will  usually  fail  after  about  2  hours.
      Because of this KERNEL.MIC will not run DFKDA.



      1.3.2  KLI Dialogue Changes

      In the KLI dialogue the start up option QUICK has ben removed.  It was
      so  similar  to  the  GO  option  that  software  eng.   considered it
      redundant and removed it.  If you were used to typing QUICK or  Q  you
      must now type GO.
      GENERAL                                                   Page 1-2



      If there is no response  within  a  minute  after  "why  reload?"  the
      defaults  will be used.  The following shows the defaults that will be
      used.

      WHY RELOAD?         !OTHER
      DATE:               !DATE OF LAST CRASH
      TIME:               !TIME OF LAST CRASH
      STARTUP OPTION?     !GO



      1.3.3  Logging In On TTY

      The account of [1,2] may not have "data set".  This  prevents  loggins
      on any terminal other than the CTY.  You can change this by logging in
      to 1,2 on the CTY and typing the followiing.

      ."R REACT"
      REACT>"CHANGE [1,2]"
      USER>"ACCESS TYPES"
      ACCESS TYPES>"DATA-SET"
      ACCESS TYPES>"^Z"
      USER>"^Z"
      REACT>"EX"
      .




      1.3.4  Password Change

      It is no longer necessary to give a password when logging  in  to  the
      1,2 account.



      1.4  MINIMUN CONFIGURATION

      To bring up 7.04 You must have a KL10 with a minimum configuration  of
      1 dual ported RP06 and 768K of memory.

      3.1  ASSUMPTIONS

      The following dialogue assumes that you have just  loaded  the  system
      and  the  console  is still running OPSER, with subjobs of OPR and GEN
      active.




      3.2  SETTING UP CI20 AND NI20

      If You want to test the CI or NI you must make them unavailable to the
      system.  This will allow diagnostics to be run that test the CI or NI.
      Type tho following on the CTY:

      !"OPR-CONFIG REMOVE CI-0"

      !"OPR-CONFIG REMOVE NI-0"


                                       NOTE

              Make sure you get a response saying that  the  devices
              were succesfully disabled.




      3.3  SETTING UP PRINTER

      To test a line printer you must copy LPFORM.INI to system area.   This
      only has to be done once.

      !"GEN-COPY LPFORM.INI[1,4]=LPFORM.INI[35,1414]"

      3.4  KERNEL.MIC

      KERNEL.MIC is a mic file that will submit batch jobs to test  hardware
      in user mode for a specified amount of time.  This is the primary tool
      used by MFG to accept the KL10 CPU.



      3.4.1  Parameters To KERNEL.MIC

      There are 5 parameters to KERNEL.MIC.  They determine hardware  to  be
      tested  and  run  time.   You must select them in the proper order and
      seperated by a comma.

                                     EXAMPLE

              A = Number of hours to run acceptance (no default)

              B = "CI" enable CI test scripts (default is no CI)

              C = "NI" enable NI test scripts (default is no NI)

              D = "LPT" enable LPT test scripts (default is no LPT)

              E  =  "CYC"  enable  cyclic  tests  (default  is   one
              continuous pass)





      3.4.2  Starting KERNEL.MIC

      Here are two examples  of  starting  acceptance.   You  should  select
      parameters deponding on the hardware you are testing.

      To start acceptance for 24 hrs.  with CI,NI,  and  LPT  selected  type
      !"GEN-DO KERNEL[35,1414]24,CI,NI,LPT"

      To start acceptance for 72 hrs.  with no CI, no NI, and  LPT  selected
      type !"GEN-DO KERNEL[35,1414]72,,,LPT"

                                   DURING-ACCEPTANCE



      4.1  INTRODUCTION


      While acceptance is running it is a good idea to  monitor  the  run.   This
      chapter  will  decribe  how to check and generate all the logs necessary to
      determine if the system if running well.



      4.2  SETTING UP A VT TERMINAL

      If you want to use a VT terminal, you may have to set the baud rate.   This
      can  be  done on the CTY by typing "GEN-SET TTY TTY4:  SPEED 9600.  TTY4 is
      the first line.  Then login to 1,2.  If you get an error saying  "data  not
      set" refer to 1.3.3.



      4.3  RUNNING SPEAR

      SPEAR is an acronym for Standard Package for Error Analysis and  Reporting.
      SPEAR  reports  on the errors and events that are recorded by the operating
      system.  This is a very useful tool for analyzing system performance.

      Running spear on KLAD10 is similar to spear  on  other  operating  systems.
      For  a  complete  description  see  the  spear manual.  The following is an
      example of how to get a brief report to the tty.

      ."R SPEAR"
      SPEAR>"RET"
      RETRIEVE MODE

      Event or packet file (SYS:ERROR.SYS): "<CR>"

      Selection to be (INCLUDED): "<CR>"

      Selection type (ALL): "<CR>"

      DURING-ACCEPTANCE                                         Page 4-2



      Time from (EARLIEST): "<CR>"

      Time from (LATEST): "<CR>"

      Output mode (ASCII): "<CR>"

      Report format (SHORT): "<CR>"

      Output to (DSK:RETRIE>RPT): "TTY:"

      Type <CR> to confirm (GO): "<CR>"




      4.4  RUNNING TGHA

      TGHA is a program that keeps track of all MOS memory  modules  and  errors.
      MOS  memory can recover from single bit errors.  These soft errors may only
      show up in TGHA, therefore it is a good idea  to  check  TGHA  periodically
      during  the  run.   Here  is  an example of getting memory information from
      TGHA.
      ."R TGHA"
      TGHA>"HISTORY"
      TGHA>"TRACE"
      TGHA>"EXIT"
      ."TYPE HISTRY.LST" (This command will type the history of memory modules)
      ."TYPE TRACE.LST"  (This command will type errors if they have occured)



      4.5  CHECKING RUN LOGS

      During the run there is a log of all output to the CTY.  This can be useful
      if  something  happens to the CTY or the printout is lost.  To look at this
      log type or print ACCEPT.LOG[1,2].

      All errors that occur during execution of tests started by  KERNEL.MIC  are
      appended  to  KERNEL.ERL[1,2].   This file can be typed or printed any time
      during the run.  This file is normally empty if no errors have occured.

      There are logs of each individual test as they run.  They  are  located  in
      the  [1,2] area.  These can also be checked anytime to see how a particular
      test is running.

                                  STOPPING-ACCEPTANCE



      5.1  AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN

      When the Specified time for acceptance runs  out  FINISH.CTL  is  submitted
      automatically  to  perform  a  shutdown  procedure.  This will stop all the
      batch jobs started by KERNEL.MIC and gather reports from SPEAR and TGHA.

      The following is an example of the message that will appear at the  end  of

      5.1.1  Stopping OPSER

      Before typing printouts, OPSER should  be  stopped.   This  will  make  the
      printouts  more  readable.   STOP.ATO is a command file to stop all subjobs
      and close the log file.  To excecute this type the following.

      !":A stop[35,1414]"

      After STOP.ATO is finnished the "*" prompt will appear, showing that  OPSER
      has no subjobs active.  Type "CONTROL C" to exit OPSER.




      5.1.2  Printing Reports

      You are now ready to type the reports that were gathered  automotically  at
      the end of the run.  Type the following commands.

      STOPPING-ACCEPTANCE                                       Page 5-2



      ."TYPE ACCSUM.RPT" (Summary report from SPEAR)
      ."TYPE ACCBRF.RPT" (Brief report from SPEAR)
      ."TYPE HISTRY.LST" (History of memory modules)
      ."TYPE KERNEL.ERL" (Log of errors in tests run by KERNEL.MIC)



      5.2  MANUAL SHUTDOWN

      If for some reason the system does not stop automatically you can  shut  it
      down manually.  The first step is stopping all the tests that are running.



      5.2.1  Stopping Batch And Print Requests

      At the exec level type the following commands to stop all batch  and  print
      requests.

      ."SUB*=/KIL"
      ."PRI*=/KIL"

      You can make sure the jobs are stopped by Typing "Q".   You  should  get  a
      response "The ques are empty".

      Now it's time to get reports.



      5.2.2  Gathering Logs And Reports

      First you should stop OPSER.  Type the following commands on the CTY.

      !":A STOP[35,1414]"
      *"^C"
      .

      Now you should be at the "." prompt.  Get a SPEAR  and  a  TGHA  report  on
      hardcopy.  Refer to chapter 4 for help.

      At this point the acceptance is stopped and it's time to review the run.



      5.3  REVIEW

      Review all of the following reports and logs.  If  the  run  is  considered
      acceptable then proceed to chapter 6 to clean the pack.

      KERNEL.ERL[1,2] will log all errors that occurred in KERNEL.MIC.

      The SPEAR report will log errors in the hardware during the run.

      TGHA will log all errors in MOS memory.

                                       CLEAN-UP



      6.1  DELETING LOGS AND REPORTS

      CLEAN.MIC  will  delete  most  logs  and  error  reports  generated  during
      acceptance.   It  will not however delete the TGHA data.  This must be done
      manually.  To excecute CLEAN.MIC type the following.

      ."DO CLEAN.MIC[35,1414]".



      6.2  CLEANING UP TGHA

      To clean up TGHA you must first make  sure  TGHA  is  not  running  on  the
      system.   Type  "SYS"  this  will  show  all jobs running.  Locate TGHA and
      identify it's job number.  Type the following to logout TGHA.

      ."R KILL"
      *"KILL (JOB # OF TGHA)"
      *"^C"

      Now you can delete the TGHA data base typing the following.

      ."DEL TGHA.TRA[1,4]"
      ."DEL TGHA.DAT[1,4]"


      The pack is now clean and the system is ready to be crashed.  Go to chapter
      7.












                                       CHAPTER 7

                                  CRASHING-THE-SYSTEM



      7.1  SYSETM CRASHES

      When a system crash occurs, whether intentionly by the operator or  as  the
      result of a Stopcode error in the monitor, and the system does an auto dump
      of memory, the crash is copied to the [10,1] are of the KLAD by the  CRSCPY
      utility.  All crashes cause by the operator have a filename of SERXXX where
      XXX is a unique number.  Crashes caused by stopcode errors  are  copied  to
      [10,1]  with  the  filname of YYYXXX where YYY is the stopcode, such as UIL
      and XXX is a unique number.  (E.G.  KAF002.EXE).

      CLEAN.MIC deletes all crashes with SERXXX file names but  does  not  delete
      saved crashes caused by a stopcode.



      7.2  MEMORY DUMPS

      In order to crash the system it is only necessary to type a  _^_\  (control
      backslash)  on  the  CTY  and  SHU to the prompt PAR>.  This will cause the
      system to crash.  What happens as a result of this command, depends on  the
      state of the operating system.

      If the "SHUtdown" command is issued without stopping timesharing the system
      will crash immediately, dump the contents of memory to [1,4] CRASH.EXE, and
      reload the last monitor to have been booted (most likely SYSTEM.EXE).  This
      is  the  same  process  that  occurs during a real system crash caused by a
      stopcode error.  It is also the same process used to  do  a  system  reload
      after changing the monitor or regenerating a new monitor per MRFAT0009.



      7.3  STOPPING TIMESHARING

      Timesharing can be stopped with the OPR command KSYS.  This will prevent an
      unnecessary dump.  Stop timesharing by typing the following.

      ."R OPR"

      CRASHING-THE-SYSTEM                                       Page 7-2



      OPR>"SET KSYS NOW"




      7.4  FINAL SHUTDOWN

      You can now type the following commands to completly crash the system.

      ."^\"
      PAR>"SHUT"
      %DECSYSTEM-10 NOT RUNNING
      BOOT>"^\"
      PAR>"ABORT"

      The system shutdown procedure is now complete and the system can be powered
      down.
