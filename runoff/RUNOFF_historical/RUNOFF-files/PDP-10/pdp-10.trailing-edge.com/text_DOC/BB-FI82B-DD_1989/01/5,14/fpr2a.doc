1.0  SUMMARY

This release of FACTPR adds support for FACT entries written by UMOUNT
and  OMOUNT,  Version 26, (code 271).  No other changes have been made
and no restrictions or bugs attended to.

It has been tested with 5.07/5.07A/6.01A in-house.  It  has  not  been
tested in-house on 5.06 monitors but is meant to work on them.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The MOUNT entries are very much like the SPOOL entry  except  for  the
following words:

     0    CODE = 271
          Job number is UMOUNTer's job number unless that  job  logged
          off;  else, and for OF entries, it is OMOUNT's job number.

     1    User's PPN.

     3    QUE = 1st letter of program (O or U) concatenated  with  1st
          letter of command (M or D or F).  'UF' is not used.

     10   The device mounted, dismounted or used in a FILE command.

     11   0

     12   F,,TIME
               F = 0 if request failed.
               F = 1 if successful.
               TIME  =  time  in  seconds  OMOUNT  dedicated  to  this
               request.


To implement the support of code  271,  FACTPR  has  been  changed  to
process  MOUNT  entries  like SPOOL entries except for the units word.
In place of the sibgle item in 'FET1'  and  'FET2',  two  entries  are
added.   The  first  prints  the  L.H.   (MOUNT flags) as 4 characters
starting at column 89, and the second prints the R.H.  (clock time) as
7 characters starting at column 93.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The are two known bugs.

     1.  The station number in spool entries is octal and not decimal.

     2.  The runtime in spool and mount entries is converted to  ticks
         instead of milliseconds for DATE75 format.

The following source compare provides the  fixes  for  the  above  two
problems:

FACTPR.DOC -- Changes from V1 to V2
October 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This version cleans up all the  error  processing,  ensures  that  the
format is always followed, adds a file identification record, adds all
the CS2 changes, adds an  assembly  option  to  produce  COBOL  SIXBIT
files, and supports the DATE75 project.

There  are  no  known  deficiencies;   no  SPRs  were  reported  which
generated  code  fixes.   It  should work on all monitors and has been
tested on 5.07/6.01.

FACTPR is not documented since it is an unsupported program.

PURPOSE OF FACTPR:  It reads the system accounting files  (SYS:FACT.*)
and writes an ASCII file in a fixed format which can be processed by a
COBOL billing program.  The program has no operational options;   each
time  it  runs  it  reads  all  accounting files and produces a single
output file.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

4      Remove the PRINTX and OUTSTR warning of the unsupported  nature
       of this program.  It is still unsupported.

5      Handle DATE-75, especially in the FACT files.

6      Use symbols from C.MAC.

7      Ignore the CCL entry point.

10     Remove unused symbols in the source.

11     Output to DSK:, not to LPT:.

12     Output errors to TTY:  also.

13     Standardize all error messages.

14     Replace all error EXITs with error messages.

15     Recode to speed up line handling and suppress trailing spaces.

16     Handle possible overflow items by setting to  the  maximum  the
       output field will allow (all 9s).

17     Support FACT items 120 and 260.

20     Change channel and accumulator references to be mnemonic.

21     Support FACT item 231 for SPRINT.

22     Catch remaining cases of DATE-75 in new format entries.

23     Pass over but notice unknown entry types.   Dump  in  octal  in
       file.

24     Fix code to catch FACT.SYS once.

25     For CS2 only, make odd customer codes be new date format.

26     Add assembly option to output COBOL  SIXBIT  files  instead  of
       ASCII.

27     Add more checks on unknown entries.

30     For CS2 only, read *.FCT not FACT.*.

31     Place all CS2 special code under FT$CS2.

32     For CS2 only, add new tables for customer codes.

33     For CS2 only, handle their incorrect use of old LOGIN entry.

34     Convert spooler runtime correctly.

35     Defend against full output line.

36     Add CS2 entry 502;  expand 000 entry line.

37     Fix CS2 entry 500.

40     Use C as a universal;   standardize  the  feature  test  names;
       default FT$SIX under FT$CS2.  Set default MAXENT to 25 (10).

41     Make spooler units only 27 bits wide.

42     Convert to sharable program.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Now is a .SHR instead of a .SAV file  and  gets  built  with  C  as  a
universal and loaded with SCAN.REL in library search mode.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.
