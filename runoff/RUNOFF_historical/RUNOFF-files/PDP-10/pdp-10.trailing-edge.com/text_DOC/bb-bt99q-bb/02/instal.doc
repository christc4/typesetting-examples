           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-10  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-10  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 10B of ALGOL-10

            Version 7.04 of ANF10

            Version 4D of SORT-10

            Version 7.04 of TOPS-10 Utilities
                                                                  Page 3


     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.



     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  DSKP:,  we
     recommend  that  you make an entry in your login procedures so that
     DSKP:  is assigned to be the structure you will be using.   If  you
     do  this  and  use the default [7,6] ppn, you will not need to edit
     the BACKUP retrieval command files provided to set-up  the  product
     distribution directories and to process the patch tape.

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  BACKUP  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed  in  [2,5]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following files should be installed in the disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP101.PDF
                UPDATE.EXE

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also contains indirect command  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These BACKUP CCL files are intended to be run  interactively.   See
     the last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-10-V2  product  you
     would install
                                                                  Page 4



                APL1S2.CTL      for APLSF-10 rebuild
                APL1S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL1S2.CCL      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.
                                                                  Page 5


     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-10-V10B  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D608D-SB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5069D-SB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   ALGOL-10
     distribution directory.
        
        From save set ALGOL-SOURCES
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
                                                                  Page 6


     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ALG].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ALG] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ALG10B.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ANF10

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS  10  V7.04
     Monitor  distribution  tape BB-X140C-SB into the disk directory you
     have set up as the ANF10 distribution directory.
        
        CHK11.P11       DDT.P11         DNCDDH.P11      DNCDDP.P11
        DNCDDQ.P11      DNCDDS.P11      DNCDMC.P11      DNCDUP.P11
        DNCNFG.P11      DNCOMM.P11      DNCRD.P11       DNCTAB.P11
        DNDBG.P11       DNDCMP.P11      DNDCP4.P11      DNDEMO.P11
        DNDEV.P11       DNDH11.P11      DNDL10.P11      DNDM11.P11
        DNDN11.P11      DNDTE.P11       DNDZ11.P11      DNLBLK.P11
        DNLP20.P11      DNLPT.P11       DNMOP.P11       DNNCL.P11
        DNNSP.P11       DNNSP3.P11      DNPLT.P11       DNPTP.P11
        DNPTR.P11       DNRAM.P11       DNRDA.P11       DNRDE.P11
        DNTRCE.P11      DNTSK.P11       DNTTY.P11       DNVFU.P11
        MACROS.P11      S.P11           TSKTST.P11

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ANF].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ANF] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:MON704.CCL[7,6]
        

     The ANF product is NOT rebuilt by Autopatch.  The Autopatch process
     will  update  the  supported  sources in the DIS:  area.  After the
     INSTALL command has  been  processed,  the  customer  may  use  the
     sources  in  DIS:  to rebuild the product with procedures which are
     appropriate to the site.

     The Patch control file for the update of this product  as  well  as
     the   Autopatch  product  description  file  are  supplied  in  the
     Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last  section
     of  this  document  for  a  list of these files.  There is a BACKUP
     command file provided in the  first  Save-set  which  will  restore
     these  files to the proper directory.  See the README documentation
     file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 8


     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  APLSF-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                APLSF.EXE
                GENSF.EXE
                TENTAP.EXE

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  APLSF-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D476E-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5065E-BB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   APLSF-10
     distribution directory.
        
           From save set "REL LIBRARY"  

                APLS12.REL
                APLG12.REL
                APLW12.REL
                APLS12.LNK
                APLG12.LNK
                APLW12.LNK

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,APL].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,APL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:APL1S2.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 9


     3.4  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING COBOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  COBOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                for Cobol-74    for 68 to 74 translation tool

     COBDDT.REL CBL74.EXE       68274.EXE
     CPYLIB.EXE CBL74C.EXE *    68274C.EXE *
     ISAM.EXE   CBL74D.EXE *    68274D.EXE *

     RERUN.EXE  CBL74O.EXE *
                CBL74K.EXE *    68274K.EXE *
                CBL74F.EXE *    68274F.EXE *
                C74LIB.REL
                C74O12.EXE

        * only if using the multi-segmented compiler (ONESEG==0)

     The COBOL V12C product may be patched via source file updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files
     from the COBOL-10 V12C distribution tape BB-H580E-SB into the  disk
     directory you have set up as the COBOL-10 distribution directory.
     COBDDT.KEY CBL74.KEY       68274.KEY
     CPYLIB.KEY CBL74C.KEY      68274C.KEY  
     ISAM.KEY   CBL74D.KEY      68274D.KEY  
     LIBARY.KEY CBL74E.KEY      68274E.KEY

                C74LIB.KEY
                C74O12.KEY


     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  COBOL  product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.
                                                                 Page 10


     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  COBOL-10

        *NOTE* EDIT.MAC is renamed as EDITC.MAC in the distribution area


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CBL].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CBL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
     To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBL12C.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBR12C.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        
     Use of any of these files will also restore the SORT files  on  the
     COBOL  tape  to  the DSKP:[7,6,SRT] area.  Also the following files
     are restored by these CCL files but not used by Autopatch:

        CRELD.MAC       GETERA.MAC      SETEOF.MAC      SRTTAB.MAC
        STRNGL.MAC

     If you will be Autopatching BOTH Cobol-74 and the 68274 Translation
     Tool  new files are required in the patching directory.  Obtain the
     COBASM.MAC file and make a copy named C74ASM.MAC.  You must  create
     a  copy  of  the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set on and
     call it TRNASM.MAC.  For more information refer to section  6.0  of
     the COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12C distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     When SELECTing COBOL with PEP you will be asked if  you  are  using
     the  multi-seg  compiler.  Unless you have set the ONESEG switch on
     in the COBASM.MAC file the correct answer is YES.  In order to have
     Autopatch  include  the  SORT  module in the OTS you must create an
     empty file named CBLSRT.FLG in the patching directory  (PAT:).   If
     the   process  can  find  CBLSRT.REL  it  will  then  be  included.
     Likewise, in order to have Autopatch include support  for  DBMS  in
     the  OTS  you  must  create  an  empty file named CBLDBM.FLG in the
     patching directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
                                                                 Page 12

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                FORDML.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DAEMDB.EXE

     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  DBMS-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D478D-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-C804D-BB(800 BPI)

     3.8  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-10   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
        FORTRA.EXE      SINGLE.EXE      FORTB.EXE       FORTC.EXE
        FORTD.EXE       FORTE.EXE       FORTF.EXE       FORTG.EXE
        DORTRA.EXE      DORTB.EXE       DOTRC.EXE       DORTD.EXE
        DORTE.EXE       DORTF.EXE       DORTG.EXE       FORO11.EXE
        FORLIB.REL      FORDDT.REL

     The FORTRAN V11 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-10 V11 distribution  tape  BB-D480G-SB  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-10 distribution
     directory.

        From the save set "FORTRAN-AUTOPATCH"   
        FORTRA.KEY      SINGLE.KEY      FORTB.KEY       FORTC.KEY
        FORTD.KEY       FORTE.KEY       FORTF.KEY       FORTG.KEY
        DORTRA.KEY      DORTB.KEY       DOTRC.KEY       DORTD.KEY
        DORTE.KEY       DORTF.KEY       DORTG.KEY       FORO11.KEY
        FORLIB.KEY      FORDDT.KEY

     If you  are  also  using  DBMS  with  FORTRAN  you  will  need  the
     FORDBM.REL  file  from  the  fourth  save-set  of  the  FORTRAN v11
     distribution tape and the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second  save-set
     of the Autopatch tape.

     If  you  desire  to  Autopatch  FORTRAN  via  updated  sources  the
     following  files  are  required to build the FORTRAN product.  They
     must  be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),   the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV
        RMSINT.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  FORTRAN-10
                                                                 Page 18

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,FTN].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,FTN] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN111.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN1X1.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        

     If you use DBMS with FORTRAN and want to have the  Autopatch  Patch
     and  Build Control file build DBMSF you must create a dummy file in
     the patching directory (PAT:) called FTNDBM.FLG.  The  presence  of
     this  file  on PAT:  will cause the BATCH control file to branch in
     order to perform the processing required to build  DBMSF.EXE.   You
     will  also need the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second save-set of the
     Autopatch tape.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a BACKUP command  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for more information.

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy all of the files in the first save set of the
     TOPS-10  DECNET  7.04  distribution  tape BB-X116C-SB into the disk
     directory you have set up as  the  MCB-10  distribution  directory.
     These files should already exist in a disk directory as part of the
     original DECNET-10 installation.  If not, they  are  on  the  first
     save set on the distribution tape.

     An indirect command control file to retrieve these files  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to  DSKP:[7,6,DECNET].   If
     you wish use this control file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,DECNET]
     as your distribution directory you will have to edit  this  command
     file   to  change  the  /RESTORE  command  to  correspond  to  your
     directory.


        To use this command file, issue the following commands:

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DEC704.CCL[7,6]


     The DECNET-10 front end build also  requires  the  following  files
     from the original installation:

        CETAB.MAC
        NETPAR.MAC
        NMLACC.MAC

     The above files are NOT on the  release  tape.   They  are  created
     during  the  required  installation process.  NMLACC.MAC is deleted
     after  a  successful  front  end  build  to  protect  the   Network
     Management  Access  Control  information  it contains.  Path to the
                                                                 Page 27


     directory in which your front end was built and do the following:

        .R NETGEN
        NETGEN>RESTORE xxxxxx.CNF

        ;where xxxxxx is your front end node
        ;name.  The configuration file (.CNF)
        ;was automatically saved when you did
        ;the original installation.

        ;If your site doesn't use Network Management Access Control
        ;skip the following 3 DEFINE commands

        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT USER foo1
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT PASSWORD foo2
        NETGEN>DEFINE EXECUTOR MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT foo2

        NETGEN>FINISH

     Copy  CETAB.MAC  and   NETPAR.MAC   into   the   MCB-10   Autopatch
     distribution  directory.   If you wish the protection of having the
     NMLACC.MAC file deleted after a successful build,  rename  it  into
     the  directory  you  have set up as the patching directory, and the
     above procedure will be required before each  Autopatch  update  of
     MCB-10.   Otherwise,  copy  NMLACC.MAC  into  the  MCB-10 Autopatch
     distribution directory.

     When SELECTing this product for Autopatching the PEP  program  will
     ask  for  the  nodename.   Use the same name as was used during the
     initial  installation.   If  your  product  installation  directory
     (INS:)  does  not  include  the  front  end  system  image, usually
     "nodename".SYS, then copy it into that directory.

     Path back to your original directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.12  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING MONITOR-10-V704

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  TOPS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
        MON.EXE
        MONGEN.EXE
        TOPS10.REL


     The MON.EXE file is a copy of your current monitor.  The  Autopatch
     process   will   create   a   new   MON.EXE   in  the  installation
     directory(INS:).

     The following files are required  to  build  the  MONITOR  product.
     They must be available in the patching area (PAT:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        EDDT.REL        JOBDAT.MAC      MACSYM.MAC      UUOSYM.MAC

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     Be sure to delete any old files  for  previous  monitors  from  the
     common patching area.  This includes *.FIL and D36PAR.*.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  TOPS-10  7.04
     BB-X140C-SB Distribution tape, into the disk directory you have set
     up as the MONITOR-10 distribution directory.
        
        From the 7.04 MONITOR dsitribution tape
        
        APRSER.MAC      AUTCON.MAC      CD2SER.MAC      CLOCK1.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MON].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MON] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following command:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:MON704.CCL[7,6]


     The following files must be in the common patching  area  when  the
     monitor is Autopatched:
        
        BUILDS.DCL      BUILDS.PTH      TOPS10.CCL      TOPS10.CMD

     It is expected that you will place a customized copy of  BUILDS.PTH
     in  PAT:.   Please  observe  the  following rules.  First, you MUST
     specify directories other then PAT:  for the  REL  (FGEN)  and  EXE
     (BUILD)  areas.   The  START.CTL procedure creates a START.MIC file
     which deletes all entries in these areas.  Second, you  should  use
     explicit  structures  and  PPNs when defining areas for FGEN, BUILD
     and BASE:.  Third, the distributed START.CTL will delete all  *.LOG
     files  in  BASE:.   A revised START.CTL with that command commented
     out can be found in the second  save-set  of  the  Autopatch  tape.
     Fourth,  you must include your definition of PAT:  and DIS:  in the
     definition of CTLS:  and  MON:.   Lastly,  invoking  START.CTL  and
     GEN.CTL  is  required  BEFORE you can select MONITOR-10 since F.MAC
     and  SYSCNF.MAC  are  created  by  GEN.   The  definition  of  PAT:
     specified  during  SELECT should match the definition in BUILDS.PTH
     to ensure accurate reporting by  PEP.   A  minimum  BUILDS.PTH  for
     building  a  monitor  can  be  found  in the second save-set of the
     Autopatch tape.

     The MPE and Customer Supported options to the TOPS-10  Monitor,  if
     used,  must  be  autopatched  before  the Control file to build the
     monitor is submitted.
                                                                 Page 30

     3.13  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING MPE-10

     You will need to copy the following file from the TOPS-10 MPE  7.04
     distribution  tape BB-X133C-SB into the disk directory you have set
     up as the MONITOR-10 distribution directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CSP].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CSP] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:MX11AS.CCL[7,6]
        
     The following files are restored by this CCL but not Autopatched:

        MX.EXE          MX.MAP          README.MEM

     The Patch control file for the update of this product  as  well  as
     the   Autopatch  product  description  file  are  supplied  in  the
     Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last  section
     of  this  document  for  a  list of these files.  There is a BACKUP
     command file provided in the  first  Save-set  which  will  restore
     these  files to the proper directory.  See the README documentation
     file in the first
                                                                 Page 34


     3.16  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  SORT-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SORT.EXE
                FSORT.EXE

     The following files are required to build the SORT  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  SORT-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D489F-SB  or  from the COBOL-10 distribution
     tape into the disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as  the  SORT-10
     distribution directory.
        
           From save set SORT-SOURCE
        
        SORT.MAC        SRTFLT.MAC      SRTCBL.MAC      SRTPRM.MAC
        SRTCER.MAC      SRTSCN.MAC      SRTCMP.MAC      SRTSTA.MAC
        SRTUUO.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,SRT].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,SRT] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:SRTV4D.CCL[7,6]
        
     This command file is valid for use  ONLY  with  the  separate  SORT
     distribution  tape.   Use  of the COBOL CCL file will load the SORT
     files from the COBOL distribution tape into DSKP:[7,6,SRT].
                                                                 Page 35


     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     These file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     When selecting the UTILITIES-10 product for Autopatching you should
     include  the  DIS:  for MONITOR as part of your path definition for
     DIS:     for    the    UTILITIES-10    product.     For    example,
     DSKP:[7,6,CSP],DSKP:[7,6,MON].
