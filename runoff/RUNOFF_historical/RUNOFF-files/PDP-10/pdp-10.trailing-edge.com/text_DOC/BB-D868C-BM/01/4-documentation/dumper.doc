DUMPER.DOC -- Changes from V3A(172) to V4(302)
December 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

DUMPER is a program for saving and restoring disk files using magtape.
It  is  used  by operations personnel for file system maintenance, and
may be employed by users who wish to keep  certain  files  on  magtape
and/or transfer them between systems.

DUMPER version 4(302) runs on TOPS-20 Release 4.

DUMPER does not require any other software modules during execution.

DUMPER is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide, and some  privileged
functions are described in the Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

File archiving, migration, and retrieval support has been added.

The interface to TOPS-20 using tape-drive allocation has  been  added.
Volume  identifiers are included in the listing when saving files on a
system using tape-drive allocation.

The SET  BLOCKING-FACTOR  command  was  added  to  achieve  a  greater
percentage of tape utilization.

The UNLOAD command was added for use  on  systems  without  tape-drive
allocation.

The INCREMENTAL feature of the SAVE command has been enhanced.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  Reverse SKIPs in interchange mode do not work.

     2.  If there are  any  read  errors  or  duplicate  records,  the
         CHECKSUM feature under the PRINT command is not valid.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run DUMPER

DUMPER.EXE is the only file needed for DUMPER execution.
DUMPER.DOC                                                      Page 3


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing DUMPER

DUMPER is loaded in SYS:  as part of the installation procedure.   New
versions may be put into use by copying the DUMPER.EXE file onto SYS:.


4.3  Files Needed to Build DUMPER

DUMPER is built from the following files:

     DUMPER.MAC
     ARMAIL.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACREL.REL
     MONSYM.UNV
     MACSYM.UNV
     QSRMAC.UNV
     GLXMAC.UNV
     ACTSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building DUMPER

SUBMIT DUMPER.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


4.5  Special Considerations

DUMPER is used during the initial phases of  system  installation  and
file structure refreshing.  For this reason, it is advisable to have a
copy of DUMPER on one or more magtapes.  DUMPER may be put on  magtape
by:

     @ASSIGN MTAn:                      ! assign and mount blank tape
     @REWIND MTAn:                      ! put DUMPER at beginning
     @COPY SYS:DUMPER.EXE (TO) MTAn:    ! copy to tape

DUMPER may be loaded and run directly from a magtape generated in this
way.

DUMPER is intended to perform a number of  privileged  functions  when
run  by  operations  personnel,  and its behavior is modified slightly
when running with WHEEL or  OPERATOR  capabilities  enabled.   Consult
User's and Operator's Guides for additional information.

None.
