SUMMARY


      1.0  SUMMARY

      GALAXY  is  a  package  of  system  utility  software  which,   in
      conjunction with the TOPS20 operating system, provides a number of
      system facilities such as  batch  processing,  and  output  device
      spooling.   In  addition, various components of the GALAXY package
      are called upon to supply supporting functions  for  other  system
      utilities like file-archiving and disk/tape mounting.

      The GALAXY release 4 package consists of  14  runnable  components
      (EXE files):

      Program     Function
      -------     --------
      QUASAR      The central queue manager and task scheduler
      LPTSPL      The line-printer output spooler
      BATCON      The batch-job control program
      OPR         The operator command interpreter
      ORION       The operator command and message processor
      SPROUT      The card-punch and papertape-punch output spooler
      CDRIVE      The card-reader stacking program
      SPRINT      The control card interpreter
      NFT         The network file transfer user interface
      FAL         The network file transfer 'listener'
      PLEASE      The operator/user message facility
      QMANGR      The queue interface for FOROTS
      GALGEN(*)   The GALAXY configurator program
      GLXLIB(**)  The GALAXY system subroutine library


      GALAXY release 4 is a major release of  the  GALAXY  package.   It
      provides  a  large  number  of  new functions and facilities and a
      number of significant changes to the user and operator interfaces.

      This DOC file describes the overall system changes.  Refer to  one
      of   the  following  DOC  files  for  a  detailed  description  of
      particular components:

               OPERATOR-INTERFACE.DOC (OPR, ORION, PLEASE)
               CARDREADER-BATCH.DOC (CDRIVE, SPRINT, BATCON)
               FILE-TRANSFER.DOC (NFT, FAL)
               OUTPUT-SPOOLERS.DOC (LPTSPL, SPROUT)




      ------------------------------

      (*)GALGEN is supplied in EXE format only.  It must be run in order
      to configure and build a non-default GALAXY system.

      (**)GLXLIB is not an independent program.  It  is  mapped  in  and
      used by all GALAXY components.

SUMMARY


      The primary enhancements and changes in GALAXY release 4 are:

      1.  New Operator Interface

          The  single  largest  project  in  release  4.   This  project
          provides  a  completely  new  interface  to the system for the
          operator.  It provides enhanced control, more information, and
          a simpler, more consistent command language.  This project has
          implied changes in all existing GALAXY software.

      2.  Network File Transfer Utilities

          Release 4 contains a set of  DECNET  file-transfer  utilities.
          These  utilities  allow  file-transfer  in  a  number of modes
          (ASCII, IMAGE, etc.) between all DECNET Phase II systems.

      3.  Support for the DN200 Remote Job Entry Station

          The GALAXY spoolers now optionally contain support  for  DN200
          Remote  Job  Entry  stations.   Use  of this facility requires
          reconfiguration of the GALAXY subsystem.

      4.  Support for the DN64/65 IBM 2780/3780/HASP Stations

          Support for these products is now optionally included  in  the
          GALAXY    subsystem.     Use   of   this   facility   requires
          reconfiguration of the GALAXY subsystem.

      5.  Native Mode Software

          All components of the GALAXY package run in native TOPS20 mode
          and do not require the TOPS10 compatibility package (PA1050).

      6.  Integrated Support for Card-punch and Papertape-punch

          Support for the CD20 card-punch and  PC20  papertape-punch  is
          now integrated into the standard GALAXY package.




      1.1  Monitor Dependence

      GALAXY Release 4 and TOPS20 Release 4 are mutually dependent.



      1.2  Other Dependencies

      Release 2 of UETP depends on GALAXY release 4.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


      2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

      There are four areas where changes in the human interface exist.

      1.  The TOPS20 terminal command language

          The PRINT, SUBMIT, MODIFY, CANCEL,  and  INFORMATION  commands
          have  been  enhanced  and in a small number of cases, changed.
          The QUENCH program has been fully superseded by these commands
          in  the TOPS20 Command Processor and is no longer distributed.
          The changes to these commands are described  in  the  EXEC.DOC
          file.

          In addition the user/operator communication program PLEASE has
          changed  significantly  to  interface  with  the  new operator
          interface.

      2.  Batch Control File Language

          This language consists of  the  additional  "TOPS20"  commands
          which  are  valid  in  batch  control files, such as GOTO, IF,
          CHKPNT, etc.  There has not been any change to  this  language
          for release 4.

      3.  Control Cards

          This language consists of the $command cards which  are  valid
          in a batch job deck.  This language has been enhanced and in a
          few instances changed.  Refer to CARD-READER.DOC for  detailed
          information.

      4.  Operator Interface

          This area has had  the  most  significant  change.   Refer  to
          OPERATOR-INTERFACE.DOC for more details.




      3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

      4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

      A fully built, default GALAXY system is distributed on the  TOPS20
      release  tape.   This  system will suffice for most installations.
      There are a number of options which will  require  reconfiguration
      and  rebuilding  of  some  or  all  of  the  GALAXY system.  These
      include:

      1.  Conditional  assembly  options  -  The  GALGEN  dialog  allows
          specification  of  a  number  of conditional assembly options.
          These options primarily  allow  changes  in  various  defaults
          (e.g.   priority, limits, etc.).  Specification of a number of
          internal  parameters  are  also   requested   (e.g.    printer
GALAXY.DOC -- Changes from version 3 to version 4                 Page 5
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


          checkpoint internal etc.).

      2.  Support of DECNET requires inclusion of  the  Network  Control
          commands (NCP) in the operator interface.

      3.  Support of DN200 requires DECNET support (as above) as well as
          inclusion of device support in the spoolers.

      4.  Support of DN64/65 requires inclusion of device support in the
          spoolers.





      4.1  Files Needed To Run GALAXY

      The  following  EXE  are  usually  needed   on   SYS:    for   all
      installations:

      QUASAR.EXE     LPTSPL.EXE     BATCON.EXE     OPR.EXE
      PLEASE.EXE     GLXLIB.EXE     SPRINT.EXE     ORION.EXE

      The following EXE are needed to support various  options  and  are
      only  needed  on  SYS:   if those options are being employed at an
      installation:

      SPROUT.EXE     if a CD20 or PC20 is to be used
      CDRIVE.EXE     if any card-readers are used
      NFT.EXE                       if network file transfer is used
      FAL.EXE                       if network file transfer is used
      QMANGR.EXE     if FORTRAN is used



      4.2  Instructions For Installing GALAXY

      4.3  Files Needed To Build GALAXY

      All files required to build the GALAXY system are  listed  in  the
      GALAXY.CMD file.



      4.4  Instructions For Building GALAXY

      To build a complete GALAXY system, the  following  steps  must  be
      taken:

      1.  Restore all files from the release tape
GALAXY.DOC -- Changes from version 3 to version 4                 Page 6
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


      2.  Copy all files required for GALAXY using the GALAXY.CMD file

      3.  Run the  GALGEN  program  to  create  the  configuration  file
          GALCNF.MAC.  Note that a default GALCNF.MAC is supplied on the
          release tape,  therefore  GALGEN  needs  to  be  run  only  if
          configuration changes are required.

      4.  SUBMIT the GALAXY.CTL file.  This control file SUBMITs control
          files for all of the GALAXY components.

      Provisions have been  made  to  allow  re-building  of  individual
      components.   Refer  to  the  appropriate  DOC  file  for  further
      information.
