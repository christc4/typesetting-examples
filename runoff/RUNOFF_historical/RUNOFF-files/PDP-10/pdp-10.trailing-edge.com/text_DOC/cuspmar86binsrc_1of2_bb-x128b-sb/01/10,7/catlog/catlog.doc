1.0  SUMMARY

CATLOG version 1 is being released for the first time with the TOPS-10
7.03 monitor and GALAXY-10/MDA 5.1 spooling system.  It is an integral
part of MDA.   For  the  purposes  of  7.03  field  test  and  monitor
installation,  it  has  been  tested  under  7.02  and  7.02/Autopatch
versions of the monitor.  The user (operator) interface is  documented
in the Operator's Command Language Reference Manual.



2.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



3.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Three module make up the catalog daemon.  CATPRM.MAC  is  a  parameter
file used by QUASAR and the catalog daemon.  Therefore, CATPRM must be
assembled before building either program.  To assemble CATPRM,

                        .COMPILE CATPRM.MAC

Since  CATLOG  communicates  with the operator as an application, both
OPR and ORION must be  loaded  with  CATTAB.MAC  after  answering  the
GALGEN questions about application support.  To assemble CATTAB,

                        .COMPILE CATTAB.MAC

To  link  CATTAB  with  OPR and ORION, follow the normal OPR and ORION
build proceedures.  CATLOG is the actual application server.  To build
CATLOG,

                        .LOAD CATLOG.MAC
                        .SAVE SYS:
