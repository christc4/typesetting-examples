1.0  SUMMARY

This version of BOOT runs on any KL10 or  KS10  using  only  KL-paging
microcode.   This  is the only TOPS-10 disk bootstrap that can be used
with the 7.03 monitor, as it fully  supersedes  previous  versions  of
BOOT  and  MONBTS.  The new BOOT should however, sucessfully bootstrap
older versions of the monitor, although it has only been  tested  with
7.02 and 7.02/Autopatch monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Because the new BOOT is a combination of the previous BOOT and MONBTS,
some  features of MONBTS have been moved into BOOT.  In addition, BOOT
has the ability to memorize data for the  monitor  across  monitor  or
BOOT reloads.



2.1  /FORCE

BOOT now supports this switch to  force  the  scanning  of  structures
DSKA, DSKB, ..., DSKZ when searching for the load or dump filespec.



2.2  Entry Vector

The first page of BOOT contains an entry vector or communications area
used  to  pass  information  between  the monitor and BOOT.  This area
contains storage for the system search list, active swapping list, and
system  dump  list,  thus  allowing  this  data to be preserved across
monitor or BOOT reloads.



2.3  Monitor Filespec

BOOT memorizes the monitor filespec, so typing  <CRLF>  at  the  BOOT>
prompt will cause the previously run monitor to be loaded.



2.4  Control-C Processing

BOOT supports Control-C processing.  Anytime  a  Control-C  is  typed,
BOOT  will respond with the BOOT> prompt and wait for a new command to
be typed.  BOOT also checks for Control-C being typed during  load  or
dump  processing  and  will  respond  with  the BOOT> prompt.  Because
terminal I/O is not interrupt driven, BOOT must poll the CTY for input
characters  during  load  or  dump  processing.   For this reason, one
should not expect immediate results when Control-C is typed.

2.5  Control-R Processing

Control-R typed during command input will cause the command line to be
retyped.



2.6  BOOT Configuration

BOOT may be configured to allow  limited  debugging  via  EDDT  and/or
include  various  microcodes.   This is accomplished by running BTONCE
and answering questions.  BOOT knows about  the  following  microcodes
and file names:

     1.   DX10/TX01     - DXMPA.A8

     2.   DX20/TX02     - DXMCA.ADX

     3.   DX20/RP20     - DXMCD.ADX

     4.   KLIPA/CI      - KLPCOD.BIN

     5.   KLNI/NI       - KNICOD.BIN



BOOT no longer needs to be reassembled for any reason.  Refer  to  the
Monitor Installation Guide for more details.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES
