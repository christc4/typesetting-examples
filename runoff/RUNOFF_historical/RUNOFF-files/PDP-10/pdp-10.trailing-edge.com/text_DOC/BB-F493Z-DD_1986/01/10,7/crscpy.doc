1.0  SUMMARY

The TOPS-10 bootstrap (BOOT) has the capability of performing very  fast
dumps  and  loads.   In  addition,  the  monitor provides a mechanism to
automatically start up a program which will copy the dump(s) just taken.
CRSCPY  is an example of a program which can be run to do this.  CRSCPY,
as described in this document is a prototype that you may  use  to  help
you  in  understanding  the monitor interface and the tasks that must be
performed by such a program.  CRSCPY is being supplied  to  serve  as  a
basis for the program you may wish to write to tailor the copy procedure
to your installation.  Every installation will have  varying  needs  and
procedures  with  regard  to  crash copying, and may indeed already have
some form of semi-automatic procedure to copy crashes.  Therefore, it is
not   expected   that  CRSCPY  will  be  used  without  change  by  each
installation.

The DIGITAL-supplied prototype supports automatic copy of  crashes  when
invoked  by the monitor, manual copy of crashes when run by an operator,
and a log and report feature of the crashes that it  copied.   Refer  to
CRSCPY.HLP  and  the  TOPS-10  Crash  Analysis  Guide  for more detailed
information about the operation of the program and  the  interface  with
the monitor.

CRSCPY has been tested on KL10  and  KS10  processors  under  the  7.02,
7.02/Autopatch, and 7.03 versions of the monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are a couple of changes that affect the REPORT command.



2.1  Crash Flag "R"

In a REPORT display, immediately following the  crash  sequence  number,
are  a  number  of flags that indicate the "state" of the crash (active,
undisposed, etc.).  There is the addition of the "R" flag.  It indicates
the crash in question caused a reload.



2.2  /PRIMETIME Switch

Previous version of CRSCPY treated prime time as  0800  to  1700,  seven
days a week.  CRSCPY now excludes weekends.
CRSCPY -- Program to copy crashes, version 1A -- October 1985     Page 3


2.3  /SUMMARY Switch

A new REPORT switch causes a summary to be appended to the  end  of  the
REPORT   display.    This   switch   takes   three  optional  arguments.
"STOPCODES" causes a summary by  stopcode  names  to  appear.   "TOTALS"
causes  a  summary  line  that  indicates  the  number of crashes, those
active, undisposed, reloads, and the total number of  crashes  on  disk.
"ALL"  causes  both  stopcodes  and  totals  to appear at the end of the
REPORT display.  If no argument is given to the /SUMMARY  switch,  "ALL"
is assumed.



2.4  /MONVER Switch

The /MONVER switch now ignores all  but  the  DEC  monitor/load  number.
This  is because the LH of %CNVER is reserved to customers, some of whom
use it for different information.



2.5  /STOPCD Switch

The /STOPCD switch argument may now be wildcarded with  the  traditional
"*" and "?" wildcard characters.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

CRSCPY searches JOBDAT, MACTEN, SCNMAC, and UUOSYM and loads  with  SCAN
and HELPER.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to the revision history in CRSCPY.MAC.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Provide a way to check that all entries in SYS:CRASH.SYS  are  still  on
disk,  and/or  determine  which  files  of  ALL:*.EXE[10,1]  are  not in
SYS:CRASH.SYS.

Add a PURGE  command  to  purge  the  first  n  disposed  entries.   the
following  FORTRAN  program purges the first n entries regardless of the
