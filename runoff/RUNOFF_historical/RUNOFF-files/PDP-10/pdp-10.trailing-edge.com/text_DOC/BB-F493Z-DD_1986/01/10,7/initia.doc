INITIA.DOC -- Changes from V10(217) to V11(254)
January 1986



1.0  SUMMARY

This release adds support  for  the  TOPS-10  version  7.03  operating
system  and  incorporates  bug fixes.  No major functionality has been
added since the previous version.  The support added for 7.03 includes
new  terminal  parameters,  the  ability  to set the account string on
INITIA logged in jobs and a  change  in  how  FRCLIN  input  has  been
handled.

All jobs logged in directly by INITIA will be given  account  strings.
These jobs include the FRCLIN job (which copies SYSJOB.INI to FRCLIN),
the TTY STOMPER and jobs started via the GALOPR,  SYSDPY,  OPSER,  etc
commands.   The  account  string  for  each  of these jobs is given in
TTY.INI using the new "ACCOUNT" option, as in

CTY: NO REMOTE ACCOUNT "SYSTEM"

The account string specified is delimited by either type of  quote  ("
or  '),  and  is a maximum of 39 printable characters in length.  This
account specifier may be applied to the "STOMP" command in TTY.INI for
the  FRCLIN/TTY  STOMPER job.  If TTY STOMPER is not run, the new line
specifier, FRCLIN, may be given instead.  For example, if TTY  STOMPER
is  to be run with account "OPERATOR", the following line would appear
in TTY.INI

STOMP ACCOUNT "OPERATOR"

If TTY STOMPR is not to be run, the FRCLIN job's account string  would
be set by the following line in TTY.INI:

FRCLIN ACCOUNT "OPERATOR"

Note that the FRCLIN job and TTY STOMPER are the  same  job,  so  both
options should not be specified.

If the ACCOUNT specifier is not given, the job is assigned the  system
default account string as given in SYSJOB.INI ("SET DEFAULT ACCOUNT").
Since the TTY STOMPER/FRCLIN job logs in before  sending  the  default
account  command  to  FRCLIN,  the  TTY  STOMPER account string should
always be specified in  TTY.INI.   No  account  string  validation  is
performed by INITIA.

Under previous version of INITIA, text from  SYS:SYSJOB.INI  would  be
passed to FRCLIN one line at a time.  This can cause input from INITIA
to become mixed with that from other users of FRCLIN.  INITIA has been
changed  to  pass all SYSJOB.INI text delimited by LOGIN commands as a
single string to FRCLIN, thus eliminating any race condition as above.
For example, a SYSJOB.INI file containing:

LOGIN
INITIA.DOC                                                      Page 3


SET HPQ 1
DAEMON
LOGIN
QUASAR

would be sent as two strings to FRCLIN:  "LOGIN<CR>SET HPQ 1<CR>DAEMON
<CR>"  and  "LOGIN<CR>QUASAR<CR>".  Note that this new behavior occurs
only under version 7.03 or later systems;  the old processing will  be
done on older monitors.

The new TRMOP.  functions  added  are  implemented  as  parameters  in
SYS:TTY.INI or the user's SWITCH.INI.  They are:

EIGHTBIT/NOEIGHTBIT           Set or clear eight bit support for  this
                              line

ESCAPE:n                      Set the alternate  escape  character  to
                              octal n.

IDLEDISC:n                    Set the dataset idle disconnect timer to
                              n seconds.

QUOTE/NOQUOTE                 Enable or disable Control-V quoting.

UNPAUSE:n                     Set the unpause character to octal n.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

221       FRCLIN will no longer set customer privilege bits.

222       TTY0 of an MCR is no longer considered a remote OPR.

223       Allow leading spaces on decimal arguments in TTY.INI

226       Change how SYSJOB.INI works:  The .TOTYP  TRMOP.   will  now
          send  the  entire  string it's given in a fashion that makes
          any race condition impossible.  Send all text in  SYSJOB.INI
          that  occurs  between  LOGIN  commands as a single string to
          .TOTYP, so there is no threat of a  race  condition  on  the
          FRCLIN command execution.

227       Remove the code to read [1,2]'s search list from AUXACC.SYS,
          now  that ACTDAE is in charge of this.  Since we log jobs in
          before ACTDAE is running, we can't count of  ACTDAE  telling
          us  what the search list should be, so just make do with the
          system search list.

230       Add  new  "EIGHTBIT",  "ESCAPE",  "QUOTE",  "IDLEDISC"   and
          "UNPAUSE"   terminal   parameters  to  TTY.INI.   This  also
          implements GCHVAL which reads character value arguments  for
          "ESCAPE" and "UNPAUSE".

232       Don't type anything on a line just slaved.
INITIA.DOC                                                      Page 4


233       Add VT220 and VT240 to  the  table  of  terminal  types  for
          SYSDPY.

235       Use %CNPRV to set the privilege word for  jobs  INITIA  logs
          in.

236       Add the "ACCOUNT" argument for TTY.INI to be applied to jobs
          INITIA logs in.  Create a new "FRCLIN" TTY specifier to mean
          the FRCLIN job.  Allow this argument on the "STOMP"  command
          as well.

237       Allow terminal specifiers of the form  NODE_nn  as  well  as
          NODE_TTYnn

          as documented in the Software Installation Guide.

240       Don't type anything on dialup lines that aren't dialed into.

241       Don't say "NOESCAPE"  or  "NOUNPAUSE"  when  the  respective
          character  is  zero.   Use  the  "NO"  prefix  only when the
          character is set to its default value.

245       Set IPCQ PID and send/receive quotas to 511 for GALOPR  jobs
          which we log in.

247       Use NETOP.  when posible to type the real  location  of  the
          terminal  (ANF/DECnet/LAT  node name and port id), and allow
          these node/port ids to  appear  in  TTY.INI.   The  TTYnn-mm
          format in TTY.INI will only work on ANF lines.

251       If the port id being typed isn't a port number  (as  is  the
          case  with  ANF-10 and CTERM connections), don't preceed the
          id with " # ", as it isn't a number.

253       Set physical and virtual page limits to  16384  (each)  when
          logging in a job.  If this fails, try 512 pages instead.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

INITIA must be saved as a sharable program.  Due to a bug, INITIA will
not function properly if saved with a non-sharable high segment.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

224       Guard  against  malicious  WAKE  UUOs  which   may   prevent
INITIA.DOC                                                      Page 5


          NOTICE.TXT from being typed in its entirety.

225       The initialization code is zeroing one too many words of low
          segment.

231       Make the TTY STOMPER look in the correct monitor section for
          the LDBs.

234       Lengthen the stack to accomodate the new HELPER.

246       Re-implement 7.02 compatibility, using the "F.OLD"  flag  to
          indicate systems older than 7.03.

252       Check the creation dates of files stored in the high segment
          against  what the real files say to prevent using stale high
          segment files.

254       Fix TTY STOMPR such that it  doesn't  zero  baud  lines  too
          soon.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
