FEFILE.DOC -- V1(27)

1.0  SUMMARY

FEFILE is a program which creates a file in  the  TOPS10  file  system
(FE.SYS[1,2]).   FEFILE allocates this file contiguously, verifys that
it contains no bad blocks, and then writes the location  and  size  of
the  file  in the home blocks.  The space represented by this file can
now be used for the console  processor  RSX20F  system  FILES-11  file
system.   It  is  recommended  that FEFILE always be run on a recently
reformatted/refreshed file structure.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES (USER INTERFACE)

FEFILE must be run before the RSX20F file system can be installed,  To
run FEFILE, login under 1,2 and type:

     .R FEFILE

FEFILE will respond with 

     DISK UNIT NAME:

Type the unit name of the unit where the file structure that  the  -11
file  system  is being created on is mounted, e.g., RPA0.  FEFILE will
then type:

     SIZE OF FILE IN BLOCKS (<CRFL> GIVES DEFAULT OF 2000)

<CRLF> would be the normal response unless it is  anticipated  that  a
large  number  of  diagnostics  will be stored in the -11 file system.
FEFILE now allocates the file, verifys that it contains no bad  blocks
by  writing the file and reading it back and if successful, writes the
address of the file in the home blocks.  FEFILE indicates  success  by
typing:

     [n DATA BLOCKS ALLOCATED TO FE.SYS]
     [FE.SYS AREA STARTS AT LOGICAL BLOCK n]
     [FRONT END FILE CREATED, HOM BLOCKS WRITTEN]

It is now possible to install RSX20F's files following the  procedures
outlined in MIG603.
