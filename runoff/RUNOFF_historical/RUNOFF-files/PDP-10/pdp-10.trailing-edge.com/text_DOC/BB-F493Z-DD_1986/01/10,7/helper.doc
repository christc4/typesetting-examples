HELPER.DOC -- Changes from version 7D(52) to 7E(55)
May, 1985



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a maintenance release of HELPER, which includes one  bug  fix.
Formerly,  HELPER  would  allow  any file to be typed by defining HLP:
with the /OVERRIDE option, then requesting help from a JACCT  program.
This  has been fixed by using a non-privileged FILOP.  read instead of
the original LOOKUP call.  If the user is logged  in  under  [1,2],  a
privileged FILOP.  read will be used.

HELPER version 7E runs on all supported monitors.  It has been  tested
on TOPS-10 V7.02.  There are no known deficiencies.



1.1  FUNCTION OF HELPER

HELPER is a subroutine used to output help texts (HLP:/SYS:??????.HLP)
onto device TTY.  It is entered in one of two ways:

A.   When using this calling sequence, the SIXBIT module  name  should
     be placed in accumulator 1:

           MOVE   1,[SIXBIT /module name/]
           PUSHJ  17,.HELPR
           return to here

B.   When using this calling sequence, the  address  to  the  argument
     block  whose  first  element  is the address of the SIXBIT module
     name (ie.  a FORTRAN or COBOL argument block) should be placed in
     accumulator 16:

           MOVEI  16,[0,,[SIXBIT /module name/]]
           PUSHJ  17,HELPER
           return to here

The return from HELPER is always to the location following the  PUSHJ.
The contents of accumulator 1 on return is not guaranteed.



1.2  SYSTEM SPECIFIC INFORMATION


When compiled for running under  TOPS-10,  HELPER  presently  requires
eighteen  locations  on  the push-down list on which to store and from
which to restore user AC's and Job First Free for use by the CORE  UUO
to  shrink  core  back  to  its  original  size.   Note that the stack
requirements have been increased from the  previous  value  of  eight.
Programs using HELPER 7E may require a larger stack as a result.  Disk
input of the HELP text is accomplished on channel 0.
HLR7D.DOC                                                       Page 3


When compiled for running under TOPS-20, HELPER requires ten locations
on the push-down list on which to store and from which to restore user
AC's.  Other locations on the list are for the help text input buffer.
By  using  this method, it is not necessary to map in extra pages, and
no extra memory is used.



2.0  CHANGES FROM HLR7D TO HLR7E

53      Use non-privileged FILOP.s to lookup the help file (unless [1,2])
        so that we don't accidentally read something we shouldn't, should
        we be running with JACCT.

54      Update copyright notice.

55      Edit 53 set .RBCNT wrong.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.




4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To  install  in  any  program,  relink  that  program  using  the  new
HELPER.REL

Note that although there are several programs  which  use  HELPER,  we
will  not necessarily rebuild all of them when HELPER is released.  If
the customer experiences a problem with a program which  is  fixed  by
the  new  versions  of  HELPER,  he  may  rebuild  the  product at his
discretion.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

Allow use of an extended channel to be used  instead  of  time-sharing
channel 0.

Permit HELPER to run in or be called from extended sections.

HELPER.DOC -- Changes from version 5(41) to 7D(52)
January, 1982



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a maintenance release of HELPER which is  being  shipped  with
maintenance  releases  of SCAN 7D and WILD 7D.  The primary purpose of
this release is to eliminate problems caused by  the  length  of  time
since  the  last  release  of HELPER.  The version number of HELPER is
being changed to make it consistent with that of SCAN and WILD.

HELPER version 7D runs on all supported monitors.  It has been  tested
on TOPS-10 V7.01 and TOPS-20 V4.  There are no known deficiencies.



1.1  FUNCTION OF HELPER

HELPER is a subroutine used to output help texts (HLP:/SYS:??????.HLP)
onto device TTY.  It is entered in one of two ways:

A.   When using this calling sequence, the SIXBIT module  name  should
     be placed in accumulator 1:

           MOVE   1,[SIXBIT /module name/]
           PUSHJ  17,.HELPR
           return to here

B.   When using this calling sequence, the  address  to  the  argument
     block  whose  first  element  is the address of the SIXBIT module
     name (ie.  a FORTRAN or COBOL argument block) should be placed in
     accumulator 16:

           MOVEI  16,[0,,[SIXBIT /module name/]]
           PUSHJ  17,HELPER
           return to here

The return from HELPER is always to the location following the  PUSHJ.
The contents of accumulator 1 on return is not guaranteed.



1.2  SYSTEM SPECIFIC INFORMATION

There is now a TOPS-20 switch in HELPER that can be set at compilation
time.   To  compile  TOPS-10  specific  code,  (the  default)  compile
HELPER.MAC with the TOPS20 switch equal to zero.  When TOPS-20  native
code is desired, create a file U.MAC containing the line

        TOPS20==1

Then  compile  U.MAC+HELPER.MAC.   This  will  permit the inclusion of
HELPER in JSYSized programs without using PA1050.  Note  that  turning
HLR7D.DOC                                                       Page 6


on the TOPS20 feature test is not supported by DEC.

When compiled for running under  TOPS-10,  HELPER  presently  requires
eight  locations  on  the push-down list (provisions should be made to
allow for ten locations to allow future expansion) on which  to  store
and  from which to restore user AC's and Job First Free for use by the
CORE UUO to shrink core back to its original size.  Disk input of  the
HELP text is accomplished on channel 0.

When compiled for running under TOPS-20, HELPER requires ten locations
on the push-down list on which to store and from which to restore user
AC's.  Other locations on the list are for the help text input buffer.
By  using  this method, it is not necessary to map in extra pages, and
no extra memory is used.

HELPER.DOC -- Changes from version 4 to 5
October, 1973





1.0  SUMMARY

1.1  This release extends HELPER to  look  at  device  HLP:,  to  read
     sequence  numbered  files, and to improve its error messages.  It
     also adds  an  entry  point  so  that  it  can  be  invoked  from
     FORTRAN-10  and  COBOL  programs.   HELPER version 5 corrects all
     SPRs received through October 10, 1973 (10-11567).

1.2  HELPER version 5 runs on all monitors.  It  has  been  tested  on
     5.06.   There  are  no  known  deficiencies.   This version fully
     supports the DATE75 project.

1.3  HELPER version 5 is documented in a program specification in  the
     Software Notebooks.
helper.doc -- changes from version 4 to 5                       Page 9


2.0  CHANGES

36   (SPR 10-9713) Handle sequenced files.  Also add an error  message
     in  case  of  I/O  errors.   This  message  is "%HLRIOE I/O ERROR
     READING HELP FILE;  I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU".

37   (SPR 10-11567) Look on device HLP:  before looking on SYS:.  This
     allows all help files to be removed from SYS:  which should speed
     up LOOKUPs.

40   Add an alternate entry point "HELPER" which can  be  called  from
     FORTRAN-10  or  from  COBOL  with  one  argument, the name of the
     program in SIXBIT.

41   Improve the error message issued when the help file  can  not  be
     found.  It now reads "%HLRNHF NO HELP FILE ON SYS:;  I'M SORRY, I
     CAN'T HELP YOU".






3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     None.






4.0  CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     None.






5.0  SUGGESTIONS

     None.
