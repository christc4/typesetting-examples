1.0  SUMMARY

DMPFIL Version 6A(7) fully supersedes  all  previous  versions.   This
version  is intended to correct a DATE75 bug.  Note that version 6A(7)
does not contain edits 1 through 6.  These edits will be  included  in
the next released version.



2.0  CHANGES COMPRISING VERSION 6A(7)

The only change is a DATE75 fix which insures that the entire creation
date  is cleared on an ENTER.  Version 6 did not take into account the
high-order bits in the creation date.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Since this is a release of  a  DATE75  fix  only,  existing  bugs  and
deficiencies have not been attended to.



4.0  CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.
