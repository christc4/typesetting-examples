1.0  SUMMARY


1.1  DTCOPY is a program for copying DECtapes.  Its previous name  was
COPY.  The name was changed since the program is not a general purpose
utility.  It is limited to a single I/O device.  The only  differences
between DTCOPY Version 7 and COPY Version 6A are the fixes required by
the DATE75 conversion.


1.2  DTCOPY works with all supported monitors.   It  has  been  tested
under 5.06B.  Version 7 of DTCOPY fully replaces Version 6A of COPY.


1.3  DTCOPY is documented in the Software Notebooks.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The only external change is the new name for the program.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See the installation instructions in the DOC file for COPY  Version  7
for  a method of minimizing user confusion from the change in the name
of this program.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Version 7 of DTCOPY includes the fixes  required  by  the  new  15-bit
system date format.
