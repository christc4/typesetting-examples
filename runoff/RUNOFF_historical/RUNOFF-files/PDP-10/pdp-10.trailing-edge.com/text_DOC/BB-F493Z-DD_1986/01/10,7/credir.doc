CREDIR.DOC -- Changes from V3 to V3A
July 1985



1.0    SUMMARY

1.1    This is a maintenance release of CREDIR.  It fixes an undesired
       side  effect of edit 104 which causes directories to be created
       with a large number of  allocated  blocks  (equivalent  to  the
       "number  of  blocks  tried for on output" parameter defined for
       the structure in the "ONCE" dialogue).   The  /ALLOCATE  switch
       name has also been expanded to a full six characters.

1.2    This program will run on any  7-series  monitor  and  has  been
       tested  under  7.01A,  7.02,  and  7.03.   It depends upon SCAN
       version 7D and WILD version 7D.  It has no  DATE-75  dependency
       and  has  no  known  deficiencies.   It cures all SPRs received
       through July, 1985.

1.3    CREDIR is documented in this file and in the software  notebook
       descriptions of the 7.02/7.03 monitor.

1.4    FUNCTION OF CREDIR
       This program is designed to create directories in an  easy  and
       reliable  fashion.   It  will  construct SFDs on all structures
       selected including any higher level directories needed.  If run
       under  [1,2],  it will create UFDs on any selected structure or
       set of structures.  The user can specify the quotas  for  these
       UFDs via either switches or a dialogue.  CREDIR is particularly
       useful for creating  the  ersatz  directories  supported  since
       5.07,  since  these are not created by the disk refresher.  All
       the operator need do is specify the names of the ersatz devices
       he  wants created and CREDIR will create them on all structures
       for that ersatz device (typically the  SYS  search  list).   As
       each  directory  is  created, the user is informed of the name,
       unit, and protection.

2.0    CHANGES

106    (10-35032) If /ALLOCATE:  not specified, don't use CL.DLL  when
       closing   directory.   Prevents  allocating  UNIGRP  blocks  to
       directory.

107    (10-35248) Switch name definition of  /ALLOCATE  contains  only
       five  characters.   Prevents saying "/ALLOCATE:".  Change it to
       have the full switch name in  the  definition.   Also  use  the
       VRSN.  macro to define CREDIR's version number.

3.0    KNOWN DEFICIENCIES

       None.


4.0    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       CREDIR expects that MACTEN,  UUOSYM,  and  SCNMAC  are  on  the
       ersatz  device  UNV  or  in  the directory that CREDIR is being
       created in.  SCAN.REL, WILD.REL, and HELPER.REL must be on  the
       ersatz  device  REL.   Load CREDIR by typing:  LOAD CREDIR.  It
       should then be SSAVEd on SYS:.  There is also a short help file
       which should be installed on the ersatz device HLP.


5.0    SUGGESTIONS

5.1    Add a way to put ersatz devices on only a selected set of  file
       structures.

5.2    Observe /NOCREATE if set.
