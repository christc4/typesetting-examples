DN92.DOC -- Changes from V7 to V10
January 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

DN92 is a remote  station  on  the  DECsystem-10  network.   It  is  a
sequential  node  based  on  a  PDP8A  processor.  It was developed to
replace the DC72NP remote station.

The DN92 requires a DECsystem-10 with a DC75NP, DN85,  DN87  or  DN87S
front  end,  and a synchronous line between the front end and the DN92
It requires TOPS-10 version 6.02 or later monitors.

Specific documentation on the  DN92  can  be  found  in  the  Software
Notebooks  write  up  entitled  Networks and Software Guide and in the
file  named  DN92.RNO.   The  DN92.RNO  file  briefly  describes   the
differences  in  implementation of the software between the DC72NP and
the DN92.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The DN92 is now  being  released  through  the  Software  Distribution
Center  (SDC)  and  is  no longer available as a special release.  The
first version being released through SDC is  version  10.   Two  other
versions have been distributed to the field, version 3 and version 7.

Changes have been made to  version  10  which  correct  the  following
problems:

     1.  The card reader was not sending the last column of a card  to
         the host (SPR 10-24343).

     2.  The line printer was not handling form control for  the  last
         six  lines  on  a  page  if  they  only contained CRLF'S (SPR
         10-24343).

     3.  DN92 was not answering data sets reliably (SPR 10-24274).

     4.  Assembly errors if FTDEBUG=0 (SPR 10-2473).

     5.  Losing input on a high speed asynchronous line.  The code was
         changed  to  process a device control message which causes an
         X-OFF character to  be  issued  to  the  device  as  soon  as
         possible.

     6.  Error message for line printer  was  not  being  sent  if  it
         occurred  on  initial  output.   The line printer routine was
         modified to send an off-line status message.

     7.  DP8E bus errors were  caused  by  the  line  printer  routine
         disabling   the   interrupt  for  too  long  when  compressed
DN9210.DOC                                                      Page 3


         characters  were  being  flushed.   Zeroing  the   repetitive
         character  count  for  flushed  characters  seemed  the  best
         solution.  Another solution is to stop the line printer,  let
         the flushed character time out, and the clock routine restart
         output to the line printer.  Hoewever, while eliminating  all
         bus errors, this solution seems to degrade the line printer's
         performance and shouldn't be  installed  until  the  definite
         problem exists.

     8.  The calculation for fill timing was modified to  reflect  the
         real-time  clock  on  the  DN92  which interrupts every 10ms.
         instead of every 16ms.  (SPR 10-25554).

     9.  DAS92 station name was changed to DN92.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The DN92 does not support trace feature DP8ETR.  It is always  set  to
0.

Programs requiring frequent changes in and out of image mode on a  TTY
line do not always get processed correctly.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The installation instructions are found in the  DECsystem-10  Software
Notebooks   Installation  Guide  and  in  the  DN92.SIG  file  on  the
distribution tape.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The DN92 was sending a NAK response for an idle REP.  It now sends  an
ACK  response.   The routine which ships status words to the host only
sends it if it has changed values.  Instead of halting, the  DN92  now
ignores a REQUEST LOAD station control message.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Be sure  to  read  the  Network  Software  Installation  Guide  before
installing the system software.  Also be sure to set up the NETLDR.INI
file correctly if there are multiple DN92'S in the network.
