DECLAR.DOC -- Program to declare user definable commands, v1(12)
September 1985



1.0  SUMMARY

Declare is a program which allows a user to declare  monitor  commands
to  run specified programs.  This allows users to run private programs
with the same ease and convenience as  allowed  for  system  programs.
The  command used to invoke the programs must be a command the program
invoked will understand.  I.e., to  invoke  the  CRSCPY  program,  the
command must be "CRSCPY" or an abbreviation thereof.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

6)   Update handling of /UNIQUE  switch  to  conform  to  new  monitor
        handling introduced by MCO 11206.
7)   Add new /AUTOPUSH switch to allow access to new ability to define
        commands that preserve a core-image.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DECLAR searches MACTEN, SCNMAC, and UUOSYM and  loads  with  SCAN  and
HELPER.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

See the edit history in DECLAR.MAC.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS
