	[VAXF81.MUDD.DUMPER]AAAREADME.DOC

This collection of subroutines implement a very basic tool to
read DEC-10 Backup and DEC-20 Dumper tapes.  It has bugs.  It does
very stupid things with the files, but a pass through TECO will
fix that.  It does get the stuff converted in a reasonable manner
and has worked for everything that I have run through it.  There
may be holes in it.  I know there is a big hole in the robustness
of error recovery.  This will be released again later if there is
further interest in it.  If you have any bug fixes, or fixes to any
of the 'features', please send me a note.
