RFIL11 reads ANSI format labeled tapes, such as those produced by RSX
and VAX systems. Because it is looking for ASCII text, binary files are
slightly trashed when read. RFIL11 uses industry format for reading, and
does its own conversion into 7 bit ascii. The only input required for the
program is the name of the tape drive tht the tape is on. The tape must be
mounted without the intervention of MOUNTR (I.E. unavailable).
