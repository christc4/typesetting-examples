     1.0  INTRODUCTION

          IOLIB  version  5  is  a  maintenance  release  that  fixes   all
     outstanding  bugs, and provides compatibility with C.MAC version 7 and
     MACRO-10 version 50.  IOLIB version 5 contains a few new features  and
     changes in specifications, detailed below.



     2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


     1.  IOLIB requires C.MAC version 7 and MACRO-10 version 50.  The files
         C.UNV  and  IO.UNV  should be installed on ersatz device UNV:.  If
         the monitor in pre-5.07 and does not recognise device UNV:,  C.UNV
         and IO.UNV should go onto SYS:.

     2.  the instructions for compiling and loading a  program  with  IOLIB
         are  very  much simpler due to the transparent way that MACRO v:50
         handles UNIVERSAL files.  If the user program contains  a  'SEARCH
         C,IO'  instruction  he  can say 'EXECUTE MYPROG,@MAC:IOLO' and all
         good things happen.

         Users are not advised to use the .REQUEST  pseudo-op  to  force  a
         library  search  of  IOLIB  at load time because the IOLIB library
         needs to be searched twice, and this is not easy with .REQUEST

     3.  the VERSN$ macro types the version numbers of C and IO used during
         assembly.

     4.  there are new macros and routines to open  a  file  for  appending
         called  $APEND  and  $APDWT.  These routines are similar to $UPDAT
         and $UPDWT.

     5.  there are new macros and routines to write a number as a number od
         blocks,  34B, ($WBWRD), a number of words ,42045W, ($WWWRD) and as
         a quantity of core in pages/kwords if an exact number of units and
         in words if not ($WCWRD).

     6.  the XTUUO$, XTCAL$ and XTDCL$ macros have  had  their  definitions
         corrected.

     7.  MAKFD$ is changed slightly to  remove  the  case  whereby  an  FDB
         address  of less than 20 was assumed to be an ac that points to an
         FDB.

     8.  add new fields to the FDB.  It now contains a path block, an extra
         word  for  the  buffer headers to allow MPX channel use, and words
         for the results of /ABEFORE  and  /ASINCE  switches.   MAKFD$  and
         $CLRFD  setup  $FDPPN  to  point  to  $FDPTH,  but  $FDPPN  may be
         overwritten by a PPN.  The buffer headers are shared by a  6  word
         path mask block and the name mask word.  $FDDIM, the old directory
         mask has been removed.

     9.  two  new  fields  have  been  added  to  the  IDB,  and  both  are
         initialised  by  BEGIN$  They  are  $IDPTH, the job's default path
         spec., and $IDCPU which defines the CPU we are running on (0=KA10,
         1=KI10).

    10.  the feature test switch FT$KIX has dissappeared.   IOLIB  runs  on
         both cpus without modification.

    11.  a new macro ADVIS$ to print advisory messages enclosed in [].  The
         definition is the same as for FATAL$.

    12.  any severity flag character can be set when calling $ERROR.

    13.  new macros and routines, $MTxxx and MTxxx$ to execute  MTAPE  UUOs
         for the current file

    14.  a $BEGIN routine to do most of the  work  of  BEGIN$.   BEGIN$  is
         reduced  to 5 words of code.  The first user word has the internal
         label $$BEG.




     3.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  $ROCT?  and $RDEC?  have been restructured to use a digit  reader,
         thus sortening both of them and the combination.

     2.  $$XUUO and $$XCAL have been made INTERNAL to aid debugging

     3.  $WWORD now continues writing characters until the SIXBIT  word  is
         empty.  It does not stop on the first blank.

     4.  many bug fixes and speed improvements
