                                  INTRODUCTION

             During the last three years, many Star  Trek  games  have
          been  introduced  to  the  University  of Pittsburgh Illicit
          Program  Library  (maintained  on  the  directories  of  the
          several  Illicit  Program Users).  Several of these Commonly
          Used  Star  Trek  Programs  (CUSPS)  were  written  at   the
          University  of  Pittsburgh,  but all of the major CUSPS were
          written at other schools and smuggled across academic  lines
          on  mag  tapes disguised as frisbees.  The CUSPS are written
          in a variety of languages (FORTRAN, BASIC, MACRO, etc.)  and
          offer  great diversity in rules and general characteristics.
          Nevertheless, they were all written  for  one  purpose:  the
          catharsis of all those nasty little frustrations accumulated
          while jousting with recalcitrant programs.

             Unfortunately all of the more sophisticated CUSPS  exceed
          the student core class (to the gratification of the Computer
          Center) and the incidence of catatonia in the  student  body
          is  rising.   In  an  effort to reverse the terrifying trend
          toward increasing withdrawals (from computer courses), a new
          Star Trek has been written (NSF grant 427698XPR).  This CUSP
          has a 2K  low  segment  and  a  5K  sharable  high  segment,
          permitting  any  student  that can log in the false euphoria
          engendered by Star Trek.


             This program is upward compatible with the Yale Real Time
          Star  Trek  (H. T. Hunt, October 1973)  'A'N'D  'I'S  designed to
          eliminate many  of  its  less  desirable  features  (erratic
          timing,  difficult  computations,  etc.) without sacrificing
          the GREAT CHALLENGE.
          
          2             Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise
          The Universe


                                  THE UNIVERSE



             You  are  the  commander  of  the   Federation   starship
          ENTERPRISE.   Your  orders  require  you  to  search out and
          destroy the hated enemy.  If  you  are  to  accomplish  your
          mission,  you  must  first  understand  the  nature  of your
          universe and the things you will find in it.

             Your universe is limited to the GALAXY; it is  surrounded
          by  an  impenetrable energy barrier and you cannot leave it.
          The galaxy is divided into QUADRANTS arranged  in  a  square
          array  (God  will  ask you for the size when he creates it).
          The relative positions of the quadrants in space  are  those
          of the quadrants in the matrix.  Therefore the quadrants are
          identified by their positions in the matrix (i.e.   quadrant
          2,5  is  in  the  second  row  and  the fifth column).  Each
          quadrant is a square 10 PARSECS on a side.  Positions within
          a  quadrant  are given by a coordinate pair as are positions
          of quadrants in the galaxy.  The only difference is that the
          coordinates   of  a  position  within  a  quadrant  are  not
          integers; they vary from 0.5 at the left and  top  edges  to
          10.5 at the right and bottom edges.  Directions are given in
          degrees with 90 straight up and 0 to the right.

             The concept of the quadrant is critical to the game.  You
          cannot  examine a quadrant in any detail when you are not in
          it.  Whenever you reenter a quadrant, it is like entering it
          for  the  first time.  The SIGNIFICANT objects that were not
          destroyed when you last were in it will still be there,  but
          they  will  have  moved!  Partially damaged enemy ships will
          have been repaired!

             You share the galaxy with seven other kinds  of  objects.
          They  are STARS, STARBASES, ROMULANS, KLINGONS, GHOST SHIPS,
          PHOTON TORPEDOES,  and  the  EXCALIBUR.   Stars,  starbases,
          Klingons, and Romulans are considered SIGNIFICANT; they will
          never change quadrants  or  simply  disappear  without  your
          knowledge.   In  particular,  Klingons and Romulans are your
          enemies; what could be more significant?

             Starbases are large  installations  designed  to  service
          starships.   They will give you all the energy (10000 units)
          and photon torpedoes (30) that you can hold.   If  you  have
          devices  damaged,  a  starbase can help you repair them.  If
          you have men killed, a starbase can give you reinforcements.
          There  is  one  difficulty;  in order to get anything from a
          starbase, you must DOCK with  it.   When  you  dock  with  a
          starbase, your speed must not exceed 0.3 parsecs/starminute.
          If it does, you will collide with the  starbase,  destroying
          this rare and valuable asset.
          
          Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise             3
          The Universe


             A ghost ship is a lost starship that wanders through  the
          galaxy  with  no  destination  or purpose; its crew is dead.
          They are not only navigational hazards  but  also  rare  and
          useful  objects.   You can dock with one and take its energy
          and photon torpedoes (you are still limited to your  maximum
          capacity).   The  maximum  ghost  docking  speed is 0.5 p/sm
          RELATIVE TO THE GHOST.

             Klingons are nasty little creatures  that  are  bred  for
          meanness.   They  enjoy  firing  their phasers at you.  When
          they hit you, the energy you must dissipate is  proportional
          to  their energy and inversely proportional to the square of
          their distance.  When they are 2 parsecs distant, they  will
          hit  you  with all their energy (initially about 500 units).
          They lose energy only when you hit them with  your  phasers;
          firing their own doesn't cost them anything.

             Romulans are in many ways easier to fight because they do
          not   fire   phasers  which  act  instantaneously  over  any
          distance.  However, Romulans are  no  less  dangerous;  they
          fire  photon  torpedoes.  If you are sufficiently agile, you
          can dodge the torpedoes for they do not  follow  you.   They
          move  at  a constant velocity once fired (Romulan torps move
          at 0.65 p/sm relative to the  Romulan).   Unfortunately,  if
          you  let  a Romulan's torpedo hit you, it will hurt you more
          than the average Klingon  phaser  hit;  the  energy  of  the
          torpedo  is the same as the energy of the Romulan (initially
          around 500 units) when it  fired  the  torpedo  and  is  not
          decreased  by the distance it had to travel.  Like Klingons,
          Romulans will lose energy only when you hit them  with  your
          phasers.

             The Excalibur is a  Federation  starship  and  likes  the
          enemy  no  more than you do.  When you find it in a quadrant
          with enemy ships, it may fire its phasers at them.  You  are
          warned  that  you can hit it with your phasers and that this
          is NOT considered a proper amusement for the captain of  the
          Enterprise.
          
          4             Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise
          The Commands


                                  THE COMMANDS



             As commander of the starship Enterprise, you  control  it
          by  typing  commands on the TTY.  Each command is a positive
          integer (except the ^Z and ^C commands).  Negative  commands
          will  cause the program to type a list of the commands.  The
          zero command is ignored.
             Many of the commands request specific  input  which  will
          always  be numeric.  If the command asks for a "target", you
          must type a pair of coordinates (position within the current
          quadrant)  on  a  single  line.   These  coordinates must be
          separated by some non-numeric  character  (e.g.   a  comma).
          All  other  requests will be for a single number on a single
          line.  When a  command  requests  specific  input,  you  may
          cancel it by typing ^Z (control-Z, not uparrow-Z).
             You may type any number in either integer format or fixed
          point  format.   The  program  will  convert  the  input  as
          required (it rounds when converting to  integer).   Exponent
          notation  will not be recognized.  The program will normally
          not read any part of a line until you type a break character
          (e.g.  carriage return).

             The Star Trek program asks for a  command  by  typing  an
          asterisk  at the left margin.  If you do not enter a command
          in about 2 seconds, it will  type  a  TIMING  CHARACTER  and
          update  the  universe  by  one  STARMINUTE  (it  changes the
          positions of moving objects, etc.).  Thereafter, it will  do
          one starminute every second or so until you enter a command.
          If you do not enter a command in 50  starminutes,  the  game
          will exit and ask for a "CONTINUE" command (in case your TTY
          dies).




                                     MOVING

             Most of the game will be spent  moving.   Three  commands
          are  available for changing your course.  Each command reads
          your desired speed and bearing from the TTY and  causes  you
          to accelerate a little bit each starminute until the desired
          course is obtained.  Unlike Yale Real Time  Star  Trek,  the
          acceleration  VECTOR  is constant (the bearing and speed are
          not changed independently).
             The only differences between the three commands  are  the
          magnitude  of  the  acceleration  and  the  energy used when
          accelerating.  Normal acceleration (command 1) is about  0.5
          p/sm**2  and  costs  about 40 units for a VELOCITY change of
          1.0 p/sm.  High acceleration (command 10) is twice as  large
          and  costs  twice  as  much  (for the same velocity change).
          Emergency acceleration (command 11) is twice  as  large  and
          
          Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise             5
          The Commands


          costs twice as much as high acceleration.

             If you request a speed greater than or equal to 1.0 p/sm,
          the  Enterprise  will  enter HYPERSPACE as soon as its speed
          reaches 1.0 p/sm.  When the Enterprise is in hyperspace,  it
          cannot interact with any other object in any way.  It cannot
          use its short range  sensors  or  fire  phasers  and  photon
          torpedoes.   The  only  thing it can run into is the edge of
          the galaxy.
             If the enterprise is in  hyperspace  and  you  request  a
          speed   less  than  1.0  p/sm,  the  Enterprise  will  leave
          hyperspace as soon as its speed drops below 1.0 p/sm.

             If the Enterprise is  not  in  hyperspace  and  it  comes
          within  about  one parsec of another object (except as noted
          under docking) it will COLLIDE with  that  object.   If  the
          object   is  a  star,  the  Enterprise  will  be  destroyed.
          Otherwise the object will  be  destroyed,  the  Enterprise's
          shields  (see the deflector commands) will be destroyed, and
          the Enterprise will be hurt (see the damage report command).
          All  warp  changes will be cancelled and the velocity of the
          Enterprise will be averaged with that of the other object.

             If the Enterprise is  in  hyperspace  when  it  enters  a
          quadrant  and  then drops out of hyperspace, any enemy ships
          that are in the quadrant will be  surprised  and  unable  to
          fire for at least one star minute.  If the Enterprise enters
          and leaves hyperspace inside the same  quadrant,  the  enemy
          will  not  be  surprised  and will fire immediately, causing
          great damage.




                               SHORT RANGE SONAR

             Two commands use the short range  sonar  to  examine  the
          contents  of the current quadrant in some detail.  The SHORT
          RANGE SCAN (command  2)  types  a  picture  of  the  current
          quadrant.   This  is  a 10 by 10 matrix of characters.  Each
          character represents an object close to that position.   The
          meanings of the characters are as follows:
                    . - no object,
                    * - star,
                    B - starbase,
                    R - Romulan,
                    K - Klingon,
                    X - the Excalibur,
                    G - ghost ship,
                    T - Enterprise photon torpedo,
                    P - enemy photon torpedo,
                    E - the Enterprise.
          If two objects are close to the same position, only the  one
          
          6             Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise
          The Commands


          that appears last in the above list will be displayed.  If a
          star is between an object and the Enterprise, that object is
          not  VISIBLE  and  (with the exception of stars) will not be
          shown in the short range scan.
             The short range scan  also  lists  many  useful  data  in
          addition  to  the quadrant picture.  One of of these data is
          the CONDITION, a color indicating the gravity of the current
          situation.   The  colors  and  their  meanings  in  order of
          increasing severity are:
               GREEN  - none of the following is true,
               YELLOW - you have less than 500 units of energy left,
               ORANGE - there is an enemy ship in the quadrant,
               RED    - a photon torpedo is in the quadrant.
          The  condition  of  greatest  severity  (that   exists)   is
          displayed.

             The SHORT RANGE TRACK  (command  15)  lists  all  visible
          enemy  ships  and moving objects.  It gives their positions,
          speeds, and energies.  When their  speeds  are  nonzero,  it
          also gives their bearings.

             If you cannot see an enemy ship you do not know where  it
          is  and  therefore cannot fire at it.  On the other hand, if
          you cannot see them,  they  cannot  see  you  and  therefore
          cannot fire at you.




                                LONG RANGE SONAR

             The LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN (command 3) is used to examine
          the  contents  of  the  9  quadrants you are in or near.  It
          types a 3 by 3 array of quadrant "content"s (the  Enterprise
          is in the center quadrant).  Each "content" is a string of 4
          digits or periods.  These characters indicate (from left  to
          right)  the  number  of  Romulans,  Klingons, starbases, and
          stars in that quadrant.  Periods are used instead of  zeros.
          If  the  "content"  is blank, the quadrant is outside of the
          galaxy.




                                  PHASER FIRE

             Your phasers are your  short  range  weapons.   They  act
          instantaneously  over any distance and simultaneously on all
          visible enemy ships (and the Excalibur).  Your phasers "hit"
          an object with an energy proportional to the energy you fire
          (the amount deducted from your supply).   The  magnitude  of
          the  energy  hit drops off with distance and is equal to the
          energy fired at about 3 parsecs.  Your phasers are  somewhat
          
          Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise             7
          The Commands


          directional  and  must be fired directly at the enemy if you
          are to do the most damage.  The  energy  "hit"  is  deducted
          from  the  object's  energy.   An object is destroyed if its
          energy is no longer positive.

             The normal phaser command (number 4) asks for a  "bearing
          to fire".  The alternate phaser command (number 44) asks for
          a "target to hit".




                                PHOTON TORPEDOES

             Your photon torpedoes are your long range weapons.   They
          do  not act instantaneously; they must first be launched and
          then must move to their  target,  but  will  always  destroy
          anything   they  hit  (other  than  the  Enterprise).   Your
          torpedoes are exactly like a Romulan's.  They will  hit  the
          Enterprise  if  you  let  them  come within collision radius
          (about 1 parsec).

             Your torpedoes are ALWAYS launched with a  speed  of  0.5
          p/sm relative to the Enterprise.  The normal torpedo command
          (number 5) asks for a bearing for each torpedo.  The torpedo
          will   be   launched   with  a  velocity  (relative  to  the
          Enterprise) in the requested  direction  with  the  standard
          magnitude.   In  other  words, the torpedo's actual velocity
          will be the vector sum of the  requested  velocity  and  the
          Enterprise's velocity.

             The alternate torpedo command  (number  55)  asks  for  a
          "target" for each torpedo.  The ship's computer will compute
          the bearing for you.  If the Enterprise is moving in such  a
          way  that  the  torpedo  cannot achieve the required bearing
          (remember, it must be launched with a speed of 0.5 p/sm  wrt
          the  Enterprise),  the  torpedo motors will burn out and the
          torpedo will have the same  position  and  velocity  as  the
          Enterprise.   You  will then have one starminute for evasive
          maneuvers before the torpedo warhead is automatically armed.

             Photon torpedoes are not launched as soon as you  request
          the   launch,  but  are  launched  at  the  rate  of  1  per
          starminute.  Note that the torpedo's  actual  velocity  will
          not  depend on the ship's velocity at the time of the launch
          request but on the  ship's  velocity  at  the  time  of  the
          launch.




          
          8             Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise
          The Commands


                                   TRAVELLING

             If you become bored waiting to move or for a device to be
          repaired,  you  can  use  the  TRAVEL  command (number 7) to
          eliminate the wait between starminutes.  You should use this
          command with discretion since the game enforces a time limit
          and you cannot afford to waste starminutes.

          (P.S.  1 starday = 100 starminutes)




                                     DAMAGE

             When you are hit by phasers or photon  torpedoes  or  let
          yourself  run into another object or the edge of the galaxy,
          you will be hurt.  This can mean the  damaging  of  devices,
          the  killing  of captains, or the killing of general purpose
          "crew".  This is very important since you cannot use devices
          that  are  damaged or have lost their captains.  Devices can
          be repaired and captains can be  replaced,  but  this  takes
          time  and  can leave the enterprise more or less defenseless
          for the duration.  Worse, if your crew  is  wiped  out,  you
          lose the game.

             The DAMAGE REPORT command (number  9)  is  used  to  list
          deaths  and  damage  times.   Damage  time  is automatically
          reported when a device  is  first  damaged,  but  additional
          destruction is not reported.  To get the actual damage time,
          you will have to use this command.




                                   DEFLECTORS

             The Enterprise has SHIELDS (DEFLECTORS) that  protect  it
          when  hit  by  phasers  or  torpedoes.   The energy "hit" is
          deducted from the shield energy and does not cause damage or
          kill  men.   An  additional advantage is that the energy you
          put into the shields  is  doubled  while  it  is  there;  it
          dissipates   twice  as  much  energy  as  it  would  in  the
          Enterprise's general energy supply.

             A shield can deflect only as much energy as it  contains.
          If  a shield is "knocked down" by more energy than it holds,
          the shield is destroyed and  the  undeflected  part  of  the
          "hit"  is deducted from the Enterprise's energy supply.  The
          undeflected energy also  damages  devices,  kills  men,  and
          causes miscellaneous havok.

          The Commands


             The Enterprise has 4 shields.  Each shield deflects  hits
          on  its side of the Enterprise.  Shield orientation is fixed
          with respect to the galaxy; it does not depend on the ship's
          bearing.

                                      270

             Energy is put into the shields with the RAISE  DEFLECTORS
          command  (number  12).   The DROP DEFLECTORS command (number
          13) returns the shield energy to the general energy supply.




                                  GALACTIC MAP

             When you use the long range scan or the short range scan,
          you  discover the contents of one or more quadrants.  If you
          are not a Vulcan, you will have difficulty keeping track  of
          the  details.  The ship's computer remembers the details for
          you (Don't laugh,  this  computer  is  reliable!)  and  will
          regurgitate them when prodded with command 16, GALACTIC MAP.
          The quadrant contents are listed in long range  scan  format
          with  unknown  quadrants  represented  by a pair of question
          marks.  An "E" is typed to the right of  the  quadrant  that
          contains the Enterprise.




                               THE OTHER COMMANDS

             Six commands have not yet been discussed.  Two  of  them,
          PULSIVE BEAMS and COMMUNUCATIONS are not implemented and are
          included only for compatibility with the Yale Real Time Star
          Trek.    The   SET  TIMING  CHARACTER  command  changes  the
          character that  is  typed  to  indicate  the  passage  of  a
          starminute.  The STATUS REPORT types some of the information
          given by the short range scan  that  does  not  require  the
          short  range  sensors.  The SAVE GAME command writes a short
          file containing all the information required to  resume  the
          current  game at a later date with the RESTORE GAME command.
          The TORPEDO LAUNCH CANCEL command (number 20) can  save  you
          torpedoes whose launches are pending.
          
          10            Manual of Operations for the U.S.S. Enterprise
          Starting and Stopping the Game


                               STARTING THE GAME

             The Star Trek program is  a  core  image  and  should  be
          started  with  the RUN command.  For example, if the program
          is called STRTRK.SHR and belongs to user [1,4],  you  should
          type
                  RUN STRTRK[1,4]               ;SEE FOOTNOTE*
          when your tty is in monitor mode.

             After you have started the program, it will  type  a  few
          lines  designed to put you in the Star Trek playing mood and
          ask for the galaxy size.  You may  then  enter  the  desired
          galaxy  size  (the  number  of  quadrants  on  a side of the
          galaxy) to create a new game  or  type  the  number  of  the
          restore command (19) to continue an old game.




                              TERMINATING THE GAME

             You may terminate your mission by typing the ^C  command,
          killing the last enemy, letting the Enterprise be destroyed,
          or using the game saving  command.   When  your  mission  is
          terminated,  the  program  types a pair of numbers that rate
          your demonstrated abilities as a starship captain.

             One of these numbers is  called  "TOTAL  EFFORT"  and  is
          simply  ten  times  the  percentage of the total enemy force
          destroyed since galaxy creation.  The other number is called
          "PROFICIENCY"  and  is ten times the percentage of the total
          enemy force destroyed since the last  game  restoration  (or
          galaxy  creation)  multiplied  by  the number of starminutes
          permitted for the entire game and divided by the  number  of
          starminutes  used  since  the  last game restore (creation).
          The proficiency is 1000 if you destroy  enemies  at  exactly
          that  rate  required  to destroy the entire initial invading
          force within the initial time limit.

          Benediction


                                  BENEDICTION




             This game is not always easy.  Sometimes we will win  and
          sometimes  we  will lose.  But whatever the outcome, we must
          give thanks


          To the industrious souls who wrote this game and others like
          it that we might fill up our logged out quota,

          To the Computer Center that we might play it (Don't  use  it
          when the system is busy),

          To the  military-industrial  complex  for  making  this  war
          possible, and

          To the enemy and crew for sacrificing their  lives  that  we
          might amuse ourselves.






                                        Good Luck!
                                        You will need it.
