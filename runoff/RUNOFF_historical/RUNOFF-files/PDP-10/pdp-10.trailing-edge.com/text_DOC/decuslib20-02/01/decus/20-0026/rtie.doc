SUBROUTINE RTIE

PURPOSE
   ADJOIN TWO MATRICES WITH SAME COLUMN DIMENSION TO FORM ONE
   RESULTANT MATRIX (SEE METHOD)

USAGE
   CALL RTIE(A,B,R,N,M,MSA,MSB,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF FIRST INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF SECOND INPUT MATRIX
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A,B,R
   MSA - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL
   MSB - SAME AS MSA EXCEPT FOR MATRIX B
   L - NUMBER OF ROWS IN B

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRICES A OR B
   MATRIX R IS ALWAYS A GENERAL MATRIX
   MATRIX A MUST HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF COLUMNS AS MATRIX B

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   MATRIX B IS ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF MATRIX A .
   THE RESULTANT MATRIX R CONTAINS N+L ROWS AND M COLUMNS.
