SUBROUTINE TTEST

PURPOSE
   TO FIND CERTAIN T-STATISTICS ON THE MEANS OF POPULATIONS.

USAGE
   CALL TTEST (A,NA,B,NB,NOP,NDF,ANS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A   - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH NA CONTAINING DATA.
   NA  - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN A.
   B   - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH NB CONTAINING DATA.
   NB  - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN B.
   NOP - OPTIONS FOR VARIOUS HYPOTHESES..
	 NOP=1--- THAT POPULATION MEAN OF B = GIVEN VALUE A.
		  (SET NA=1)
	 NOP=2--- THAT POPULATION MEAN OF B = POPULATION MEAN
		  OF A, GIVEN THAT THE VARIANCE OF B = THE
		  VARIANCE OF A.
	 NOP=3--- THAT POPULATION MEAN OF B = POPULATION MEAN
		  OF A, GIVEN THAT THE VARIANCE OF B IS NOT
		  EQUAL TO THE VARIANCE OF A.
	 NOP=4--- THAT POPULATION MEAN OF B = POPULATION MEAN
		  OF A, GIVEN NO INFORMATION ABOUT VARIANCES OF
		  A AND B.  (SET NA=NB)
   NDF - OUTPUT VARIABLE CONTAINING DEGREES OF FREEDOM ASSOCI-
	 ATED WITH T-STATISTIC CALCULATED.
   ANS - T-STATISTIC FOR GIVEN HYPOTHESIS.

REMARKS
   NA AND NB MUST BE GREATER THAN 1, EXCEPT THAT NA=1 IN
   OPTION 1. NA AND NB MUST BE THE SAME IN OPTION 4.
   IF NOP IS OTHER THAN 1, 2, 3 OR 4, DEGREES OF FREEDOM AND
   T-STATISTIC WILL NOT BE CALCULATED.	NDF AND ANS WILL BE
   SET TO ZERO.
