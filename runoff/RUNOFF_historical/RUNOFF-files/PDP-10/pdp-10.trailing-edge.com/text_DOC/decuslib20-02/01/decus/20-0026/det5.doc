SUBROUTINE DET5

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE A VECTOR OF DERIVATIVE VALUES GIVEN A VECTOR OF
   FUNCTION VALUES WHOSE ENTRIES CORRESPOND TO EQUIDISTANTLY
   SPACED ARGUMENT VALUES.

USAGE
   CALL DET5(H,Y,Z,NDIM,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   H	 -  CONSTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE ARGUMENT
	    VALUES (H IS POSITIVE IF THE ARGUMENT VALUES
	    INCREASE AND NEGATIVE OTHERWISE)
   Y	 -  GIVEN VECTOR OF FUNCTION VALUES (DIMENSION NDIM)
   Z	 -  RESULTING VECTOR OF DERIVATIVE VALUES (DIMENSION
	    NDIM)
   NDIM  -  DIMENSION OF VECTORS Y AND Z
   IER	 -  RESULTING ERROR PARAMETER
	    IER = -1  - NDIM IS LESS THAN 5
	    IER =  0  - NO ERROR
	    IER =  1  - H = 0

REMARKS
   (1)	 IF IER = -1,1, THEN THERE IS NO COMPUTATION.
   (2)	 Z CAN HAVE THE SAME STORAGE ALLOCATION AS Y.  IF Y IS
	 DISTINCT FROM Z, THEN IT IS NOT DESTROYED.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   IF X IS THE (SUPPRESSED) VECTOR OF ARGUMENT VALUES, THEN
   EXCEPT AT THE POINTS X(1),X(2),X(NDIM-1) AND X(NDIM), Z(I)
   IS THE DERIVATIVE AT X(I) OF THE LAGRANGIAN INTERPOLATION
   POLYNOMIAL OF DEGREE 4 RELEVANT TO THE 5 SUCCESSIVE POINTS
   (X(I+K),Y(I+K)) K = -2,-1,...,2.  (SEE HILDEBRAND, F.B.,
