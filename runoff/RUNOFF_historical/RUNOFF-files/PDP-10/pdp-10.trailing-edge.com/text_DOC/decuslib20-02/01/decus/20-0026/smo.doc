SUBROUTINE SMO

PURPOSE
   TO SMOOTH OR FILTER SERIES A BY WEIGHTS W.

USAGE
   CALL SMO (A,N,W,M,L,R)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING TIME SERIES DATA.
   N - LENGTH OF SERIES A.
   W - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH M CONTAINING WEIGHTS.
   M - NUMBER OF ITEMS IN WEIGHT VECTOR.  M MUST BE AN ODD
       INTEGER.  (IF M IS AN EVEN INTEGER, ANY FRACTION
       RESULTING FROM THE CALCULATION OF (L*(M-1))/2 IN (1)
       AND (2) BELOW WILL BE TRUNCATED.)
   L - SELECTION INTEGER.  FOR EXAMPLE, L=12 MEANS THAT WEIGHTS
       ARE APPLIED TO EVERY 12-TH ITEM OF A.  L=1 APPLIES
       WEIGHTS TO SUCCESSIVE ITEMS OF A.  FOR MONTHLY DATA,
       L=12 GIVES YEAR-TO-YEAR AVERAGES AND L=1 GIVES MONTH-TO-
       MONTH AVERAGES.
   R - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N.  FROM IL TO IH ELEMENTS OF
       THE VECTOR R ARE FILLED WITH THE SMOOTHED SERIES AND
       OTHER ELEMENTS WITH ZERO, WHERE
	    IL=(L*(M-1))/2+1  ................ (1)
	    IH=N-(L*(M-1))/2  ................ (2)

REMARKS
   N MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT OF L*M.
