                                 CHAPTER 1

                                INTRODUCTION



    Before the advent of Public Packet Switching Networks (PPSN), a user who
    wished  to access a remote computer system from a terminal had to either
    lease a dedicated line from his site to the remote  computer  system  or
    connect  the terminal to the remote system with a low speed asynchronous
    modem through the public telephone network.

    Over the past few years PPSNs have grown tremendously as more  and  more
    computer  systems  have  been connected to the network.  This growth has
    made it easier for users to exchange and  distribute  information  among
    many  computer  systems.   The number and diversity of the many database
    services offered via the PPSN is testimony to this growth.

    With the introduction of the TOPS-20 PSI Gateway it  becomes  desireable
    for  tusers  on a local TOPS-20 system connected to the PPSN to initiate
    an interactive terminal session with a remote  computer  system  (to  be
    refered  to  from here on as the REMOTE-HOST) also connected to the PPSN
    without having to resort to the use of low speed asynchronous modems  or
    dedicated leased lines.

    X29PAD is a program that allows a user on a TOPS-20 system  initate  and
    carry on an interactive terminal session with a REMOTE-HOST on the PPSN.
    The user gains access to the PPSN through the Gateway between the DECnet
    network and the X.25 based PPSN.

                              X29PAD COMMANDS











































                                    2-1
 


    ABORT    ABORT



    Description


        The  ABORT  command  stops  the  transmission  of  a  file  to   the
        REMOTE-HOST.


    Format


        X29PAD>ABORT (the transmition of the file currently being sent)


    Function


        The ABORT command allows the user to stop the sending of a  file  to
        the  REMOTE-HOST.   This  command terminates the transfer and closes
        the file being sent.  The user is left in command  mode  from  which
        other commands may be issued.


    Notes


        An implicit ABORT is done whenever the call to  the  REMOTE-HOST  is
        terminated either by the user or because of a network error.


    Error messages


        %There is no file currently being send


















                                    2-2
         


    BREAK    BREAK



    Description


        The BREAK command initiates a break sequence and then continues  the
        call.


    Format


        X29PAD>BREAK (and continue the call)



    Function


        The BREAK command causes a break  sequence  to  be  initiated.   The
        actions   performed   are  determined  by  the  ACTION-ON-BREAK  PAD
        Parameter's value ( X.3 Parameter No.   7  ).   After  the  required
        sequence  is  performed,  X29PAD attempts to continue the call.  The
        call will not be continued if the ACTION-ON-BREAK PAD  Parameter  is
        set to ESCAPE to command mode.


    Notes


        Some users may wish  to  disable  the  BREAK-CHARACTER  and  causing
        breaks to occur by typing the ESCAPE-CHARACTER followed by the BREAK
        command.  This may be advisable if the user intends to use an editor
        such  as  EMACS  on  the REMOTE-HOST since most characters are EMACS
        commands.

    CALL    CALL



    Description


        The CALL command attempts to establish a connection to  a  specified
        REMOTE-HOST.


    Format


        X29PAD>CALL argument-1 argument-2 ,
        X29PAD-CALL>subcommand

        where

        argument-1                    is either a numeric DTE address  or  a
                                      REMOTE-HOST   name.   The  REMOTE-HOST
                                      name   must   have   been   previously
                                      specified with the DEFINE command.

        argument-2                    is   an   optional   subaddress    (if
                                      argument-1 is a DTE address)

        ,                             a comma at  the  end  of  the  command
                                      instructs   X29PAD   to   enter   CALL
                                      subcommand mode to allow you to  enter
                                      call specific subcommands


                          CALL Command Subcommands


        ABORT                         Aborts the current call and returns to
                                      command mode.

        CLOSED-USER-GROUP             Allows     you     to     supply     a
                                      CLOSED-USER-GROUP name for the current
                                      call (or override the  default).   The
                                      CLOSED-USER-GROUP has a maximum length
                                      of 16 characters.

        FACILITIES-DATA               Allows you to  supply  FACILITIES-DATA
                                      for   this   call   (or  override  the
                                      default).  The maximum length  of  the
                                      FACILITIES-DATA is 63 bytes.

        HELP                          Gives help with the CALL subcommands.

        INFORMATION                   Displays the current  call  parameters
                                      (either  as  supplied or defaults that

                                    2-4
                                      will be used).

        USER-DATA                     Allows you to supply USER-DATA for the
                                      outgoing   call   (or   override   the
                                      default).  The maximum length  of  the
                                      USER-DATA is 12 bytes.


    Function


        The CALL command is used to  initiate  a  terminal  session  with  a
        REMOTE-HOST.  One form of the command is:

            X29PAD>CALL remote-host-name

        where the remote-host-name has been  defined  previously  using  the
        DEFINE  command.   Typing a ?  after CALL will list the names of the
        remote hosts that have been defined up to that  point.   Optionally,
        you may elect to supply the actual DTE address and subaddress.  This
        format is:

            X29PAD>CALL dte-address dte-subaddress

        where dte-address and dte-subaddress are the numeric string  of  the
        REMOTE-HOST you wish to call.

        You may enter subcommands by typing a COMMA and a  RETURN  following
        the  name  or number of the REMOTE-HOST you are calling.  Subcommand
        mode is used to supply  (or  modify,  if  defaults  have  been  set)
        certain call related data fields.  Specificly, the user may elect to
        supply  or   modify   the   CLOSED-USER-GROUP   data   string,   the
        FACILITIES-DATA  string,  and the USER-DATA string.  Subcommand mode
        has the following subcommands:

            ABORT       CLOSED-USER-GROUP     FACILITIES-DATA
            HELP        INFORMATION           USER-DATA


        The  ABORT  subcommand  allows  the  user  to  exit  from  the  CALL
        subcommand  mode  return  to X29PAD command mode without placing the
        outgoing call.  The format of this subcommand is:

            X29PAD-CALL>ABORT (this attempt to place a call)

        Any data entered in subcommand mode is lost if the user  ABORTS  the
        call.


        The  CLOSED-USER-GROUP  subcommand  allows  the  user   to   specify
        CLOSED-USER-GROUP  data  in the form of a quoted string.  The format
        of this subcommand is:

            X29PAD-CALL>CLOSED-USER-GROUP (is) argument

        where argument is a quoted string of up  to  sixteen  characters  in
        length.

                                    2-5
        If specified, the CLOSED-USER-GROUP subcommand overrides any default
        previously  specified  by  the  SET  DEFAULT  CALL CLOSED-USER-GROUP
        command.  Also, if specified, data supplied by the user is valid for
        a particular call and must be resupplied for any subsequent outgoing
        calls.


        The   FACILITIES-DATA   subcommand   allows   the   user   to    set
        FACILITIES-DATA  on a per call basis.  The format of this subcommand
        is:

            X29PAD-CALL>FACILITIES-DATA (are) arguments

        where the arguments are either octal data in the range 0 to  377  or
        quoted ASCII strings.  For example, the following subcommand:

            X29PAD-CALL>FACILITIES-DATA (are) 1 1 0 0 "A2" 3 21

        sets the FACILITIES-DATA string for this call to:

                    <1><1><0><0>A2<3><21>



                                      Caution

            Default FACILITIES-DATA are overridden by data  supplied  by
            the  user  to  the  FACILITIES-DATA  subcommand  to the CALL
            command.  Issuing  the  FACILITIES-DATA  subcommand  without
            supplying  data  clears  the FACILITIES-DATA data string for
            this call.



        The HELP subcommand allows the user to obtain  help  with  the  CALL
        subcommands  without  having  to abort the current outgoing call and
        return to the top command level.  The HELP subcommand provides  help
        with  those  subcommands  available  in  CALL  subcommand mode.  The
        format of this subcommand is:

            X29PAD-CALL>HELP (with) argument

        where  argument  is  optional  and  if  supplied  is  one   of   the
        subcommands.


        The INFORMATION subcommand allows the user to examine call data that
        has  been  entered  and  will be used for the current outgoing call.
        The format of this subcommand is:

            X29PAD-CALL>INFORMATION (about current CALL parameters)

        The INFORMATION subcommand  will  display  any  data  the  user  has
        supplied  in  subcommand mode.  If a specific parameter has not been
        modified by the user in subcommand mode the  default  data  will  be
        displayed (and noted).


                                    2-6
        The USER-DATA subcommand allows the user to set USER-DATA on  a  per
        call basis.  The format of this subcommand is:

            X29PAD-CALL>USER-DATA (are) arguments

        where the arguments are either octal data in the range 0 to  377  or
        quoted ASCII strings.  For example, the following subcommand:

            X29PAD-CALL>USER-DATA (are) 1 1 0 0 "A2" 3 21

        sets the default USER-DATA string to:

                    <1><0><0><0><1><1><0><0>A2<3><21>

        Issuing the USER-DATA subcommand without supplying data  clears  the
        default data string.



                                      Caution

            Default USER-DATA are overridden by  data  supplied  by  the
            user to the USER-DATA subcommand to the CALL command.  Also,
            there is a mandatory four byte string that prefixes any user
            supplied  data.  The string is <1><0><0><0> and indicates to
            the REMOTE-HOST that the call is an X.29 call.



        If you have not already supplied a network name and password  (using
        the SET NETWORK command) you will be asked to supply them before the
        call to the remote-host will be placed.


    Notes


        Sometimes  X29PAD  will  not  be  able  to  complete  a  call  to  a
        REMOTE-HOST  due  to problems in the Public Packet Switching Network
        (PPSN).  If the cause of the failure is somewhere in the  PPSN,  the
        PPSN  will  report  the error as two numbers, the Network Clear Code
        and the Diagnostic Code.  X29PAD will try to interpret  the  Network
        Clear  Code.   However,  no  attempt  will  be made to interpret the
        Diagnostic Code  since  the  Diagnostic  Codes  are  PPSN  specific.
        Consult  your  network  vendor's  documentation for a description of
        these codes.  The following example shows a call that failed:

    CLEAR    CLEAR



    Description


        The CLEAR command causes the current call to be terminated.


    Format


        X29PAD>CLEAR (current call)


    Function


        The CLEAR command directs X29PAD to terminate the current call to  a
        REMOTE-HOST.   Any  output  from  the  REMOTE-HOST that has not been
        displayed will be lost.  X29PAD will display the date and  time  the
        call  was  cleared  along  with the number of characters and packets
        that were transmitted and received.


    Notes


        An implicit CLEAR is done whenever the user issues the EXIT  command
        and there is a call to a REMOTE-HOST in progress.

        to be closed.


    Format


        X29PAD>CLOSE (log file!)

         ***** Log file closed at 13:16:28-EST on January 13, 1984 *****


    Function


        The CLOSE command is used to terminate the  logging  of  a  terminal
        session  previously  initiated  by  the LOG command.  A timestamp is
        displayed and added to the end of the log file after which  the  log
        file is closed.


    Notes


        An implicit CLOSE is done whenever the user issues the EXIT  command
        and logging is in progress.

    CONTINUE    CONTINUE



    Description


        The CONTINUE command causes X29PAD to continue the current  call  to
        the REMOTE-HOST.


    Format


        X29PAD>CONTINUE (current call)


    Function


        The CONTINUE command directs X29PAD to  reenter  communication  with
        the REMOTE-HOST, displaying information sent from the REMOTE-HOST on
        the user's terminal and sending data entered  by  the  user  to  the
        REMOTE-HOST.

    DEFINE    DEFINE



    Description


        The DEFINE command allows the user to associate names with  the  DTE
        addresses of REMOTE-HOSTS.


    Format


        X29PAD>DEFINE (remote-host) name (as DTE number) arg-1 arg-2

        where

        name                          is a  user  chosen  string  of  up  to
                                      sixteen characters in length

        arg-1                         is a numeric string of up  to  fifteen
                                      digits  in length which corresponds to
                                      the network address of the REMOTE-HOST

        arg-2                         is an optional  numeric  string  which
                                      specifies the subaddress desired


    Function


        The DEFINE command is similar to the TOPS20 DEFINE command  in  that
        it  allows  the  user  to  associate names with the dte-addresses od
        various REMOTE-HOSTS.  This eliminates the  need  for  the  user  to
        remember  numerous  long  numeric  strings.   The  user  may  remove
        REMOTE-HOST definitions by typing a carriage return after giving the
        REMOTE-HOST name without specifying a dte-address.


    Notes


        If a REMOTE-HOST has been previously defined, defining it again will
        simply   replace   the  old  dte-address  with  the  newly  supplied
        dte-address.

        The  command  INFORMATION  (about)  REMOTE-HOSTS  will  display  all
        REMOTE-HOSTS  that  have been defined along with the DTE-address and
        (if supplied) DTE-subaddress.

        During the processing of a CALL command the DTE-subaddress string is
        appended   to   the  DTE-address  string.   Therefore,  calling  the
        REMOTE-HOST names defined in the following commands:

                                    2-13
            X29PAD>DEFINE HOST-A 12345 67

        would connect the user to the same destination.

    EXIT    EXIT



    Description


        The EXIT command causes X29PAD to cease  execution  and  return  the
        user to the EXEC.


    Format


        X29PAD>EXIT (from X29PAD)


    Function


        The EXIT command returns the user to system command mode.


    Notes


        The EXIT command will cause an implicit CLEAR command to be executed
        if a call to a REMOTE-HOST is in progress.  This will be followed by
        an implicit CLOSE command if logging is being done.

        Continuing X29PAD after the user has exited  will  cause  X29PAD  to
        place  the  user in command mode without reinitializing itself.  All
        REMOTE-HOST definitions and defaults remain unchanged.

    HELP    HELP



    Description


        The HELP command gives the user help with X29PAD's commands.


    Format


        X29PAD>HELP (with) argument-1 argument-2 ...  argument-n

        where

            argument-1 is one of the following:

                ABORT     BREAK    CALL    CLEAR   CLOSE
                CONTINUE  DEFINE   EXIT    HELP    INFORMATION

                X29PAD

            argument-2 through argument-n are dependent on argument-1


    Function


        The HELP command is a  hierarchial  help  facility.   The  user  may
        obtain  help  with  all  of  X29PAD's  commands  and  more  detailed
        information  about  various  aspects  of  the  commands.   Typing  a
        question  mark  will  give the user a list of subtopics available at
        any point in the command string.

    LOG    LOG



    Description


        The LOG command causes X29PAD to record the output of the session in
        a file on disk for later reference.


    Format


        X29PAD>LOG (output to file) filespec

         ***** Log file opened at 12:34:53-EST on January 26, 1984 *****

        where

        filespec                      is the  name  of  the  file  the  user
                                      wishes  to  use as the destination for
                                      logging


    Function


        The LOG command enables the user to record a terminal session with a
        REMOTE-HOST  for  later reference and examination.  While logging is
        in progress everything displayed on the  users  terminal  (with  the
        exception  of output generated by the user typing a question mark in
        command mode) will be recorded in the file designated by  the  user.
        The  first  entry in the log file will be a timestamp indicating the
        date and time logging was initiated.


    Notes


        The way the LOG command functions is determined by  certain  default
        conditions  that  may  be  changed by the user using the SET DEFAULT
        (for) LOG command.  The user may elect  to  have  X29PAD  append  to
        currently  existing  log files or to supersede existing files with a
        file of a new generation.  The user may also direct X29PAD to either
        suppress  or  not  suppress  any  null  characters received from the
        REMOTE-HOST.  The current state of these default conditions  may  be
        determined  by  using  the  INFORMATION  (about)  DEFAULTS (for) LOG
        command.

    PUSH    PUSH



    Description


        The PUSH command allows the  user  to  create  a  new  EXEC  command
        process and enter it leaving X29PAD frozen intact.


    Format


        X29PAD>PUSH (command level)


    Function


        The PUSH command creates an inferior process, maps a new copy of the
        EXEC  into it and starts it running.  X29PAD then suspends execution
        until the inferior EXEC stops running (e.g.  the user issues the POP
        command).  The user may then continue with what he was doing.


    Notes


        If there was a call to a  REMOTE-HOST  in  progress  when  the  user
        issued  the  PUSH command, there is no guarantee that the circuit is
        still intact.  No notification will be given to the user if the call
        is  aborted  due  to a network error while the user is communicating
        with the new EXEC.  The only indication the user will receive is  an
        error message upon issuing the CONTINUE command.

    SEND    SEND



    Description


        The SEND command causes a file to be read from disk and sent to  the
        REMOTE-HOST.


    Format


        X29PAD>SEND (file) filespec

        where

        filespec                      is the  name  of  the  file  the  user
                                      wishes to transmit to the REMOTE-HOST


    Function


        The SEND command directs X29PAD to open the user specified file  and
        transmit  it  on  a line by line basis to the REMOTE-HOST.  When the
        end of the file is reached  X29PAD  closes  the  file  and  reenters
        command  mode.   While sending a file, X29PAD ignores all input from
        the keyboard except for the ESCAPE-CHARACTER,  the  BREAK-CHARACTER,
        and  the  STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER.   The  user  may  terminate  the
        transmission of a file by using the ABORT command.


    Notes


        The SEND command does not process data read from the source file  as
        if  it  were  typed  by the user.  Instead (for efficiency and lower
        overhead) the SEND command sends data to the REMOTE-HOST on  a  line
        by  line  basis.  A line is defined as a character string terminated
        by a carriage return.

        The   user   may   monitor   the   transmission   by   typing    the
        STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER periodicly.

        The operation of the SEND command is governed by a number of default
        parameters.   By  using  the SET DEFAULT (for) SEND command the user
        may direct X29PAD to change the defaults for the SEND command.

        The user may direct  X29PAD's  SEND  command  to  either  strip  any
        linefeeds  immediately following carriage returns or to transmit all
        linefeeds in the data stream regardless  of  position.   The  normal
        action  is  to  strip  any  linefeed  immediately follows a carriage

                                    2-21
        return since most hosts automatically insert a linefeed  after  each
        carriage return received.

        Because of the way some REMOTE-HOST's X.29 servers are interfaced to
        the  system monitor, data may be lost if it is sent in large bursts.
        For this reason, the user may use the SET DEFAULT (for) SEND command
        to  set  a default time for the SEND command to pause between lines.
        By setting an appropriate delay value the user can avoid overrunning
        the REMOTE-HOST.

    SET    SET



    Description


        The SET command allows  the  user  to  set  various  parameters  and
        default modes of operation.


    Format


        X29PAD>SET argument-1 argument-2 ...  argument-n

        where

        argument-1 is one of the following:

         BREAK-CHARACTER   DEFAULT          ESCAPE-CHARACTER
         NETWORK           PAD-PARAMETER    STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER

        argument-2 through argument-n are dependent on argument-1


    Function


        The SET command gives the user  of  X29PAD  the  ability  to  change
        certain  default  operating  conditions  and  other  diverse program
        parameters.  There are six major  variations  to  the  SET  command.
        They  are  denoted  by the second keyword in a SET command.  The six
        possible keywords are:

         BREAK-CHARACTER   DEFAULT          ESCAPE-CHARACTER
         NETWORK           PAD-PARAMETER    STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER

        Of these six, three of them (BREAK-CHARACTER, ESCAPE-CHARACTER,  and
        STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER)  allow the user to select (or disable) the
        three interactive,  single  character  commands.   The  other  three
        (DEFAULT,  NETWORK,  and  PAD-PARAMETER)  allow  the  user to change
        various parameters and command defaults.  These  six  variations  of
        the SET command are documented individually in the following pages.


    Notes


        While all SET commands may be issued while a call to  a  REMOTE-HOST
        is  in progress, care should be taken and the user should attempt to
        understand the scope of any changes that are made.  The user  should
        consult  the documentation to determine if any adverse results might
        occur.

    SET BREAK-CHARACTER    SET BREAK-CHARACTER



    Description


        The SET BREAK-CHARACTER command allows the user to change or disable
        the interactive, single character command Break.


    Format


        X29PAD>SET BREAK-CHARACTER argument-1 argument-2

        where

        argument-1 is one of the following:

            the octal ASCII code for character

            any printing character in double quotes

            the keyword CONTROL followed by  argument-2  which  will  be  an
            ASCII character in double quotes


    Function


        The SET BREAK-CHARACTER  command  allows  the  user  to  select  the
        character  that  will be recognized as an interactive request by the
        user for X29PAD to perform a  break  sequence.   When  the  selected
        character  is  typed  by  the  user  during  an interactive terminal
        session with a REMOTE-HOST, X29PAD will  perform  a  break  sequence
        whose  actions  are  governed by the ACTION-ON-BREAK Pad Parameter (
        X.3 Parameter No.  7 ) value.

        The BREAK-CHARACTER may be any character whose octal value is in the
        range 1 through 377.


    Notes


        The user may disable the interactive Break command  by  setting  the
        BREAK-CHARACTER  to  0  (zero).   The user may then cause a break to
        occur by typing the ESCAPE-CHARACTER followed by the BREAK command.

        If the BREAK-CHARACTER selected is the same as the  ESCAPE-CHARACTER
        the  interactive break command will be disabled because X29PAD scans
        typed input for the  ESCAPE-CHARACTER  before  the  BREAK-CHARACTER.
        Thus,  the  user will escape to X29PAD's command mode and will never

                                    2-24
        reach the code to perform the interactive break.

        If   the   BREAK-CHARACTER   selected   is   the   same    as    the
        STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER,  the  interactive  status-display  command
        will  be  disabled  since  X29PAD  scans   typed   input   for   the
        BREAK-CHARACTER before the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER.  Thus, the user
        will cause X29PAD to execute  a  break  sequence  and  the  code  to
        perform the interactive status-display.

                                      from the REMOTE-HOST and  not  include
                                      them  in  the  log file.  (This is the
                                      DEFAULT.)


        SET DEFAULT (for) SEND:

        PAUSE n                       Causes the SEND  command  to  PAUSE  n
                                      seconds  between each line transmitted
                                      to  the  REMOTE-HOST.   (The   DEFAULT

    SET ESCAPE-CHARACTER    SET ESCAPE-CHARACTER



    Description


        The SET ESCAPE-CHARACTER  command  allows  the  user  to  change  or
        disable  the  interactive,  single  character  command  to return to
        command mode.


    Format


        X29PAD>SET ESCAPE-CHARACTER argument-1 argument-2

        where

        argument-1 is one of the following:

            the octal ASCII code for character

            any printing character in double quotes

            the keyword CONTROL followed by  argument-2  which  will  be  an
            ASCII character in double quotes


    Function


        The SET ESCAPE-CHARACTER command  allows  the  user  to  select  (or
        disable)  the  character  X29PAD  will  interpret  as an interactive
        request to escape to command mode.  When typed by the  user,  X29PAD
        will  figuratively  place  the  call  to the REMOTE-HOST on hold and
        reenter command mode from which  the  user  may  issue  commands  to
        modify  parameters,  send  a  file  to  the REMOTE-HOST, initiate or
        terminate logging of the terminal session, or clear the call.

        The ESCAPE-CHARACTER may be any character whose octal  value  is  in
        the range 1 through 377.


    Notes


        Characters typed by the user are checked to  see  if  they  are  the
        ESCAPE-CHARACTER  before  any  other  processing  is  done.   If the
        character typed by the user  is  the  ESCAPE-CHARACTER  then  X29PAD
        returns  to  command  mode and the character is discarded.  Thus, if
        either the BREAK-CHARACTER or the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER (or both)
        are set to the same character as the ESCAPE-CHARACTER these commands
        will be effectively disabled.

                                    2-29
        It is possible to disable the interactive escape command by  setting
        the ESCAPE-CHARACTER to 0 (zero).


                                      Caution

            This is not recommended.  There are many ways to get into  a
            state  where  there  is  no way to terminate the call to the
            REMOTE-HOST other than by having your  system  manager  kill
            you  job.  There are some REMOTE-HOST X.29 servers that have
            provided no way for a user to terminate the  call  from  the
            REMOTE-HOST.    Therefore,   it   is  recommended  that  the
            interactive escape command always be enabled by  having  the
            ESCAPE-CHARACTER set to some suitable value.

            the keyword CONTROL followed by  argument-2  which  will  be  an
            ASCII character in double quotes


    Function


        The SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER command allows the user  to  select
        (or  disable)  the character X29PAD will interpret as an interactive
        request to display the call status.  When typed by the user,  X29PAD
        will  print  a single line containing information regarding the call
        status.  Information provided includes the date and time,  the  port
        state,  and  the  number  of  characters and packets transmitted and
        received.

        The ESCAPE-CHARACTER may be any character whose octal  value  is  in
        the range 1 through 377.


    Notes


        The interactive status-display command may be  disabled  by  setting
        the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER to 0 (zero).

        If the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER is set to the same value  as  either
        the   ESCAPE-CHARACTER   or   the  BREAK-CHARACTER  the  interactive
        status-display command will be effectively disabled since characters
        typed  by  the  user  are  checked  to  see  if  they are either the

                             X.3 PAD PARAMETERS



The following is a list of the CCITT X.3 PAD  Parameters  along  with  their
meaning  and  possible  values.  X29PAD does not use all of these currently.
Those parameters not used by X29PAD are flagged with star (*).

PLEASE NOTE:  The user should not attempt to set individual PAD  Parameters.
X29PAD  initializes them each time it tries to place a call to a remote host
and the remote host then will set  them  to  a  known  state.   Setting  PAD
Parameters  in  the  middle  of  a  terminal  session with a remote host can
produce unpredictable (and undesireable) results.


  Parameter                     Description
   Number


     1.  Escape to Command Mode (*).  This parameter has two possible values         Escape to Command Mode
         -  ALLOWED or DISALLOWED.  X29PAD ignores this parameter and always
         allows  the  user  to  return  to  command  mode  by   typing   the
         ESCAPE-CHARACTER.

     2.  Echo.  This parameter  determines  whether  X29PAD  should  do  the         Echo
         echoing of characters or the remote host will do the echoing.  This
         parameter has two possible values - LOCAL or REMOTE.

     3.  Data Forwarding.  This parameter describes the  set  of  characters         Data Forwarding
         that,  when  typed  by  the  user,  will  cause  X29PAD to transmit
         whatever data is in the  input  buffer.   This  parameter  has  the
         following possible values:

         1.  No data forwarding character specified (disabled).

         2.  Alphanumerics (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)

         3.  Carriage Return

         4.  Escape Characters (ESC, BEL, ENQ, ACK)




                                    B-1
         5.  Editing Characters (DEL, CAN, DC2)

         6.  Terminator Characters (ETX, EOT)

         7.  Forms Control Characters (HT, LF, VT, FF)

         8.  All Other Control Characters

         Only the following combinations of the above are legal:

         1.  (1)

         2.  (3)

         3.  (3 and 4)

         4.  (3 and 6)

         5.  (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) - DEFAULT


     4.  Idle Timer.  This parameter controls the frequency that X29PAD will         Idle Timer
         forward data in the input buffer to the remote host.  The timer may
         either be DISABLED or be set to an interval from  0.05  seconds  to
         12.75  seconds  in  0.05  second  increments.   The  Idle  Timer is
         DISABLED by default.

     5.  DTE to Network Flow Control (*).  This parameter determines whether         DTE to Network Flow Control
         X29PAD  can  use  XON/XOFF  to control data flow from the terminal.
         X29PAD does not currently use this parameter.

     6.  PAD Service Signal Suppression (*).  This parameter  determines  if         PAD Service Signal Suppression
         X29PAD   will   suppress  service  signals.   X29PAD  ignores  this
         parameter.

     7.  Action on Break.  This parameter specifies the action X29PAD  takes         Action on Break
         when  the  user  types  the  BREAK-CHARACTER  on the terminal.  The
         possible values are:

         1.  No action

         2.  X29PAD sends an interrupt to the remote DTE

         3.  X29PAD sends a reset to the remote DTE

         4.  X29PAD sends an Indication Break message to the remote DTE

         5.  X29PAD enters command mode

         6.  X29PAD discards output to the terminal (Parameter 8 set to 1)

         7.  Combination of 2, 4, and 6

         The default value for this parameter is RESET.




                                    B-2
     8.  Discard Output.  This parameter determines if X29PAD  will  display         Discard Output
         data from the remote host on the user's terminal or discard it.

     9.  Carriage Return Padding (*).  This parameter controls the number of         Carriage Return Padding
         nulls  X29PAD  should  send after it sends a carriage return to the
         terminal.  X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    10.  Line Width (*).  This parameter is the width of the users terminal.         Line Width
         X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    11.  Rate (*).  This parameter contains the speed of the users terminal.         Rate
         X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    12.  Network to DTE Flow Control (*).  This parameter determines whether         Network to DTE Flow Control
         or not the user's terminal can control the data flow from the local
         host system.  X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    13.  Linefeed  Insertion  after   Carriage   Return.    This   parameter         Linefeed  Insertion  after   Carriage   Return
         determines  if  and  when  X29PAD  will  insert  a linefeed after a
         carriage return  in  the  data  stream.   This  parameter  has  the
         following values:

         1.  Never insert a linefeed after a carriage return.

         2.  Insert a linefeed after carriage returns sent to the terminal.

         3.  Insert a linefeed after carriage returns  sent  to  the  remote

        the  BCUG  facility  allow  one  or both of the DTEs to access or be
        accessed by DTEs outside the group.  These additions  are  known  as
        BCUG   with   Outgoing   Access   and   BCUG  with  Incoming  Access
        respectively.

        capability  for assembling and disassembling packets.  A computer is
        one type of packet-mode DTE.

    Packet Receive Sequence Number (P(R))

        The P(R) number indicates that all packets up that number minus  one
        have   been   received.    The   P(R)  number  thus  authorizes  the
        transmission of further packets by updating the lower window edge.

    Packet Send Sequence Number (P(S))

        The P(S) number specifies the position of a packet in  a  sequential
        stream.   The  number  starts  at  zero  for  the  first  packet and
        increases by one for each successive  packet  sent  on  one  logical
        channel in one direction.  The P(S) number may be either modulo 8 or
        modulo 128 although modulo 8 is the default for all PPSNs.  A packet
        can  only be transmitted if its P(S) is greater than or equal to the
        lower window edge and less than the upper window edge.

    Packet Switching

        A data transmission process, utilizing addressed packets, whereby  a
        channel  is  occupied  only  for the duration of transmission of the
        packet.

            In certain data communication  networks,  the  data  may  be
            formatted into a packet or divided and then formatted into a
            number of packets (either by the data terminal equipment  or
            by  equipment  within  the  network)  for  transmission  and
            multiplexing purposes.

        switching environment.

    Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)

        A permanent logical association between two DTEs, which is analogous
        to  a  leased  line.  Transmission of packets on a PVC needs no call
        set up or call clearing by the DTE.  Packets are routed directly  by

        This  bit  is  usually  reserved  for  special applications, such as
        higher level protocols.  For example,  X.29  protocol  messages  are
        transmitted between PADs as qualified data messages.

    Remote DTE

        A frame of reference:  any DTE in a network other than  the  one  at
        which the user is located.

    Remote Virtual Terminal

        A  terminal  connected  to  a  Packet   Assembly/Disassembly   (PAD)
        facility.

    Reset

        A reset allows a DTE to re-initialize a virtual circuit by resetting
        the  lower  window edge and P(S) and P(R) numbers to zero.  All Data
        and Interrupt packets that may be in the network are discarded.

    Reverse Charging

        An optional PPSN facility that allows a  DTE  to  request  that  the
        remote DTE is charged for a particular call.

    Start Element

        start-stop transmission.

    SVC

        See Switched Virtual Circuit.

    Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC)

        A temporary logical association between two DTEs connected to a PPSN
        which  is  analogous to connection by a dial-up line.  An SVC is set
        up only when there is data to transmit and is cleared when the  data
        transfer is complete.

    Tariff

        A published rate for telecommunications services.

    Throughput Class Negotiation

        An optional PPSN facility that indicates the maximum data rate for a
        particular  virtual circuit.  The facility allows a DTE to request a
        higher or lower  data  rate  depending  on  the  throughput  of  the
        packets.

    Virtual Circuit

        An association between two DTEs connected to a PPSN whereby the  two
        DTEs are able to interact as if a specific circuit were dedicated to
        them throughout the transmission.  In reality, a logical  connection
        is  established,  and  the  actual  physical  circuits are allocated
        according to route availability, overload conditions, and so on.

    Window

        At the DTE/DCE interface of the logical channel used for an  SVC  or
        PVC  and  for each direction of transmission, a window is defined as
        the ordered set of consecutive data packets authorized to cross  the
        interface.   The  lowest sequence number in the window is called the
        lower window edge.  When an SVC or PVC at the DTE/DCE interface  has
        just  been established, the window related to each direction of data
        transmission has a lower window edge equal to 0.   The  packet  send
        sequence number of the first data packet not authorized to cross the
        interface is the value of the upper window edge;  that is, the lower
        window edge plus the windowsize.

        start-stop  mode DTE accessing the Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD)
        facility in a public data network situated in the same country.

    X.29

        A CCITT recommendation that specifies procedures for the exchange of
        control  information  and  user data between a packet-mode DTE and a
        Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD) facility.
