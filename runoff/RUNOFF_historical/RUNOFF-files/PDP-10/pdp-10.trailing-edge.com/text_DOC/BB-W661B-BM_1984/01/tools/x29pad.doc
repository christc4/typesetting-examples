1.0  INTRODUCTION     INTRODUCTION

X29PAD is a program that will allow a user on a TOPS20 system to connect  a
terminal  to  a remote host through an X.25 Public Packet Switching Network
(PPSN).  It is the logical equivalent of  the  DECnet-20  SETHOST  program.
X29PAD  emulates  a  PAD  (Packet Assembly and Disassembly) in the PPSN and
transfers data to and from the remote host  according  to  the  CCITT  X.29
standard.


                                  BEWARE                                  BEWARE

X29PAD was written with the expressed goal that  it  communicate  with  any
remote  host.   Therefore,  X29PAD has been written to adhere as closely as
possible to the CCITT X.3  standard  and  does  not  make  any  attempt  to
understand "National PAD Parameters".  X29PAD's actions will be governed by
X.3 PAD Parameters 1 through 18 only.

Please note that this is a preliminary release of X29PAD documentation.

INSTALLATION INFORMATION                                          27 Feb 84


     1.  Copy X29PAD.EXE to SYS:

     2.  Optionally, create PS:<SYSTEM>X29PAD-DEFAULTS.INIT and include any
         X29PAD  commands  you  wish  all  users running X29PAD to execute.
         This file may include DEFINE commands to define remote host  names
         for  your user community so that they do not need to remember long
         network address strings.  You may also  include  the  SET  NETWORK
         NAME  and  SET  NETWORK  PASSWORD  commands  to preset the Gateway
         Access name and password for your users.  If you elect to do this,
         your  users  will not be required to supply them to gain access to
         the X.25 network via the Gateway.

     3.  Create PS:<SYSTEM>X29PAD-ACCOUNTING.ACT and set its protection  to
         770404.  This file is discussed in the next section on accounting.
         Note that the protection of this  file  MUST  BE  770404  so  that
         unprivileged  users  running  X29PAD will be able to append to it.
         If this file does not exist, no accounting will be done  until  it
         is created and protected accordingly.

Anytime a user runs X29PAD and issues the CALL command an accounting record
will be appended to PS:<SYSTEM>X29PAD-ACCOUNTING.ACT if  the  call  request
gets out into the PPSN.  The format of the call record is as follows:

     1.  Date in the form dd-mon-yy

     2.  Time in the form hh:mm:ss

     3.  User's Name

     4.  Terminal the user is logged in on

     5.  The DTE Number the user called

3.0  USING X29PAD     USING X29PAD

X29PAD is a program which will allow a user  to  "SET  HOST"  to  a  remote
system  through  the  X.25  Gateway.   The  remote  host  need not be a DEC
computer.

X29PAD has the following commands:

     Command                      Description

     BREAK         Perform the BREAK function and continue the call
     CALL          Initiate a call to a selected REMOTE-HOST
     CLEAR         Clear a call that was in progress
     CLOSE         Close the log file opened by the LOG command
     DEFINE        Define a REMOTE-HOST in terms of its DTE address
     EXIT          Exit to the EXEC
     HELP          Give help with X29PAD's commands and operation
     INFORMATION   Give information on various parameters in X29PAD
     LOG           Record the session in a designated log file
     PUSH          Push to a new EXEC
     SET           Set one of X29PAD's parameters
     TAKE          Take a command file


To learn how to obtain more information type:

  X29PAD>HELP (with) HELP         HELP        HELP

                  or

  X29PAD>HELP (with) X29PAD         HELP        X29PAD



3.1  BREAK     BREAK


The BREAK command causes X29PAD to initiate a break sequence, perform those
functions specified by the ACTION-ON-BREAK PAD Parameter, and (if possible)
continue the call by entering data transfer mode.



3.2  CALL     CALL


The CALL command is used to initiate a terminal session with a remote host.
The command format is:

  X29PAD>CALL remote-host-name         CALL remote-host-name

where the remote-host-name has been defined  previously  using  the  DEFINE          remote-host-name
command.   Typing  a  ?  after CALL will list the names of the remote hosts
that have been defined up to that point.

Optionally, you may elect to supply the actual DTE address and  subaddress.
The format is:

  X29PAD>CALL dte-address dte-subaddress         CALL dte-address dte-subaddress

where the dte-address is the number of the remote host to which you wish to          dte-address
connect  to  and  the dte-subaddress is an optional number corresponding to                      dte-subaddress
the desired remote host's subaddress.

If you have not already supplied a network name and password (using the SET
NETWORK  command)  you  will be asked to supply them before the call to the
remote-host will be placed.



3.3  CLEAR     CLEAR

The CLEAR command is used to disconnect a call initiated by a CALL command.
The form of the CLEAR command is:

  X29PAD>CLEAR         CLEAR

There are no arguments or options for this command.



3.4  CLOSE     CLOSE

The CLOSE command terminates session logging and closes the log  file  that
was initiated by using the LOG command.  The format of the command is:

  X29PAD>CLOSE (log file!)         CLOSE




3.5  CONTINUE     CONTINUE

The  CONTINUE  command  allows  the  user  to  continue  a  call  that  was
interrupted  by  the  typing  of  the ESCAPE-CHARACTER to return to command
mode.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>CONTINUE (current call)         CONTINUE

The CONTINUE command  will  attempt  to  restart  communications  with  the
REMOTE-HOST and will notify the user if this is not possible.



3.6  DEFINE     DEFINE

The DEFINE command is used to associate the name of a remote  host  with  a
DTE  address and (optionally) a DTE subaddress.  The format of this command
is:
X29PAD - TOPS-20 PSI X.29 PAD Emulator                               Page 7X29PAD - TOPS-20 PSI X.29 PAD Emulator
USING X29PAD                                                      27 Feb 84


  X29PAD>DEFINE remote-host-name (to be) dte-address dte-subaddress         DEFINE remote-host-name         dte-address dte-subaddress

where the remote-host-name is an alphanumeric string of up to 16 characters          remote-host-name
in  length, and dte-address and dte-subaddress are numeric strings of up to                dte-address     dte-subaddress
15 digits in length.

The DEFINE command may also be used to remove a remote host from the remote
host table.  This is done by typing a carriage return after the name of the
remote host you wish to delete.  The format is:

  X29PAD>DEFINE remote-host-name <carriage-return>         DEFINE remote-host-name

The DEFINE command  may  also  be  used  to  change  the  DTE  address  and
subaddress  of  a  remote  host  that  has  already  been defined by simply
defining the remote host again.  The entry for this  remote  host  will  be
updated in the remote host table.



3.7  EXIT     EXIT

The EXIT command causes X29PAD to return the user to TOPS20  command  mode.
If  a  CALL  to  a REMOTE-HOST is still in progress it will be cleared.  If
LOGGING was being done, the log file will be closed and logging terminated.
Typing  the  TOPS20 CONTINUE command will cause X29PAD to resume execution,
but you must re-enable logging manually.



3.8  HELP     HELP

The HELP command is the way a user can  obtain  more  detailed  information
relating  to  the  operation of X29PAD than is available through the inline
help facility (i.e.  "?").  The format of the HELP command is:

  X29PAD>HELP (with) argument-1 argument-2 ... argument-n         HELP        argument-1 argument-2     argument-n

where argument is a key word in the context of the command it is found  in.
For example, typing the following:

  X29PAD>HELP (with) SET PAD-PARAMETER IDLE-TIMER <carriage-return>         HELP        SET PAD-PARAMETER IDLE-TIMER

would give you a description of the IDLE-TIMER parameter which is changable
via the SET command.

In all cases, typing a "?" at any point will give you a  list  of  optional
key  words you may elect to supply or you may type a carriage-return at any
point to receive information about the last key word typed in context.

3.9  INFORMATION     INFORMATION

The INFORMATION command allows you  to  obtain  information  about  various
parameters and topics in X29PAD.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>INFORMATION (about) argument         INFORMATION         argument

where argument is one of the following:      argument

        DEFAULTS        LAST-NETWORK-ERROR      PAD-PARAMETERS
        REMOTE-HOSTS    STATUS                  VERSION

For more help with any of these arguments type:

  X29PAD>HELP (with) INFORMATION argument         HELP        INFORMATION argument



3.9.1  INFORMATION (about) DEFAULTS       INFORMATION         DEFAULTS

The INFORMATION (about) DEFAULTS allows you to display the current defaults
for the LOG command and the TAKE command.



3.9.2  INFORMATION (about) LAST-NETWORK-ERROR       INFORMATION         LAST-NETWORK-ERROR

The INFORMATION (about) LAST-NETWORK-ERROR command gives the  user  a  more
verbose  description  (and  possible  causes)  of the last reported network
error.  The format of the command is:

  X29PAD>INFORMATION (about) LAST-NETWORK-ERROR         INFORMATION         LAST-NETWORK-ERROR



3.9.3  INFORMATION (about) PAD-PARAMETERS       INFORMATION         PAD-PARAMETERS

The INFORMATION (about) PAD-PARAMETERS command allows the user  to  display
the  current  state  of the PAD.  The PAD (Packet Assembly and Disassembly)
parameters are the values that determine how  the  terminal  will  act  and
exchange  data  with  the remote-host.  PAD parameters may be set either by
the remote-host or by the user via  the  SET  PAD-PARAMETER  command.   PAD
parameters  set by the remote-host are denoted by a star (*) preceeding the
parameter.  The format of the command is:

  X29PAD>INFORMATION (about) PAD-PARAMETERS         INFORMATION         PAD-PARAMETERS

For more information on specific PAD parameters type:

  X29PAD>HELP (with) SET PAD-PARAMETER argument         HELP        SET PAD-PARAMETER argument

3.9.4  INFORMATION (about) REMOTE-HOSTS       INFORMATION         REMOTE-HOSTS

The INFORMATION (about) REMOTE-HOSTS command provides the user with a  list
of  REMOTE-HOSTS  that  have  been  defined  via  the DEFINE command.  Each
REMOTE-HOST will have displayed the DTE address and  (optionally)  the  DTE
subaddress associated with it.

The format of the command is:

  X29PAD>INFORMATION (about) REMOTE-HOSTS         INFORMATION         REMOTE-HOSTS




3.9.5  INFORMATION (about) STATUS (of X29PAD)       INFORMATION         STATUS

The INFORMATION (about) STATUS (of X29PAD) command gives the user a summary
of  X29PAD's  state  and counter information.  It also displays the current
NETWORK NAME and PASSWORD, ESCAPE-CHARACTER, and  STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER.
The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>INFORMATION (about) STATUS (of X29PAD)         INFORMATION         STATUS



3.9.6  INFORMATION (about) VERSION       INFORMATION         VERSION

The INFORMATION (about) VERSION command displays  the  version  number  and
edit number of X29PAD.



3.10  LOG      LOG

The LOG command causes your terminal session  to  be  recorded  in  a  file
specified by the user.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>LOG (output to file) output-filespec         LOG                  output-filespec

where output-filespec is the filename the user wishes to call the log file.      output-filespec

3.11  PUSH      PUSH

The PUSH command is analogous to the TOPS20  Monitor  PUSH  command.   This
command  allows  you  to push to a new copy of the TOPS20 EXEC and pop back
into X29PAD at some later point in time.  Popping back from  the  new  EXEC
does  not discard the EXEC you pushed to or any subsequent programs running
under it.  You may PUSH back down to that EXEC and  continue  any  programs
started by that EXEC.



3.11.1  SET        SET

The SET command allows you to change or set various parameters  and  values
used by X29PAD.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>SET argument-1 argument-2 ... argument-n         SET argument-1 argument-2     argument-n

where argument-1 is one of the following:      argument-1

 BREAK-CHARACTER     DEFAULT             ESCAPE-CHARACTER
 NETWORK             PAD-PARAMETER       STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER

and argument-2 through argument-n are dependent on  argument-1.   For  more    argument-2         argument-n                   argument-1
information type:

  X29PAD>HELP SET argument-1 argument-2 ... argument-n         HELP SET argument-1 argument-2     argument-n

Use "?" to find out what specific options are available for each argument.




3.11.2  SET BREAK-CHARACTER        SET BREAK-CHARACTER

The SET BREAK-CHARACTER command allows you to define  a  special  character
which,  when typed, will cause X29PAD to perform the actions defined by the
ACTION-ON-BREAK PAD Parameter.  This action might  be  to  discard  pending
terminal  output  or possibly reset the network.  The format of the command
is:

  X29PAD>SET BREAK-CHARACTER (to) argument         SET BREAK-CHARACTER      argument

where argument is the octal value for the ASCII character code you wish  to      argument
be  the  escape  character  or any printing character in double quotes.  An
alternate form of this command is:

  X29PAD>SET BREAK-CHARACTER (to) CONTROL argument         SET BREAK-CHARACTER      CONTROL argument

This form of the command is used to define  the  BREAK-CHARACTER  to  be  a
control  character.  The argument is a printing character in double quotes.                         argument
For example, to set the BREAK-CHARACTER to CONTROL-P you would type:

  X29PAD>SET BREAK-CHARACTER (to) CONTROL "P"         SET BREAK-CHARACTER      CONTROL "P"
X29PAD - TOPS-20 PSI X.29 PAD Emulator                              Page 11X29PAD - TOPS-20 PSI X.29 PAD Emulator

The BREAK-CHARACTER may be disabled by setting it to a value of  zero.   If
this  is  done,  the  user  may  still cause a break to occur by typing the
ESCAPE-CHARACTER followed by the BREAK command.

Note that the default BREAK-CHARACTER is CONTROL-X.



3.11.3  SET DEFAULT        SET DEFAULT

The SET DEFAULT command allows you to set default values for certain X29PAD    SET DEFAULT
command  parameters.   These parameters affect the actions performed by the
specified command.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>SET DEFAULT argument-1 argument-2 ... argument-n         SET DEFAULT argument-1 argument-2 ... argument-n

where argument-1 is one of the following:      argument-1

        LOG        TAKE

and argument-2 through argument-n are dependent on argument-1.    argument-2         argument-n                  argument-1




3.11.3.1  SET DEFAULT LOG - The SET DEFAULT LOG command allows you  to  set          SET DEFAULT LOG       SET DEFAULT LOG
certain defaults for the LOG command.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>SET DEFAULT (for) LOG (to) argument-1 argument-2         SET DEFAULT       LOG      argument-1 argument-2

where argument-1 is one of the following:      argument-1

  APPEND      NO           SUPERSEDE     SUPPRESS




3.11.3.1.1  SET DEFAULT LOG APPEND - The SET  DEFAULT  LOG  APPEND  command            SET DEFAULT LOG APPEND       SET  DEFAULT  LOG  APPEND
causes  X29PAD  to  append to an existing log file rather than supersede it
with a new generation.  For example, if you specify that  the  default  for
logging should be APPEND and you issue the LOG command to X29PAD specifying
a log file that already exists, X29PAD will  append  to  the  existing  log
file.

You may desire a new generation of log file.  If so, you may  use  the  SET                                                                        SET

The user should not attempt to set individual PAD Parameters.  This command
is  supplied for the purposes of debugging and should be used with caution.
X29PAD initializes the PAD Parameters each time it tries to place a call to
a  remote  host  and  the  remote host then will set them to a known state.
Setting PAD Parameters in the middle of a terminal session  with  a  remote
host can produce unpredictable (and undesireable) results.




3.11.7  SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER        SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER

The SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER command allows you  to  define  a  special
character  which, when typed, will cause X29PAD to display the current call
status.  The format of the command is:

  X29PAD>SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER (to) argument         SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER      argument

where argument is the octal value for the ASCII character code you wish  to      argument
be the status display character or any printing character in double quotes.
An alternate form of this command is:

  X29PAD>SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER (to) CONTROL argument         SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER      CONTROL argument

This form of the command is used to define the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER  to
be  a  control  character.   The argument is a printing character in double                                 argument
quotes.  For example, to set the STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER to CONTROL-P  you
would type:

  X29PAD>SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER (to) CONTROL "P"         SET STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER      CONTROL "P"

The STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER may be disabled by setting it to  a  value  of
zero.

Note that the default STATUS-DISPLAY-CHARACTER is CONTROL-A.



3.11.8  TAKE        TAKE

The TAKE command allows the user to direct X29PAD to execute  a  series  of
commands from a specified file.  The format of this command is:

  X29PAD>TAKE (commands from) file-spec

                            X.3 PAD Parameters


The following is a list of the CCITT X.3 PAD Parameters  along  with  their
meaning  and  possible values.  X29PAD does not use all of these currently.
Those parameters not used by X29PAD are flagged with star (*).

PLEASE NOTE:  The user should not attempt to set individual PAD Parameters.
X29PAD initializes them each time it tries to place a call to a remote host
and the remote host then will set them  to  a  known  state.   Setting  PAD
Parameters  in  the  middle  of  a  terminal session with a remote host can
produce unpredictable (and undesireable) results.


  Parameter                     Description
   Number


     1.  Escape to Command Mode  (*).   This  parameter  has  two  possible         Escape to Command Mode
         values - ALLOWED or DISALLOWED.  X29PAD ignores this parameter and
         always allows the user to return to command  mode  by  typing  the
         ESCAPE-CHARACTER.

     2.  Echo.  This parameter determines  whether  X29PAD  should  do  the         Echo
         echoing  of  characters  or  the  remote host will do the echoing.
         This parameter has two possible values - LOCAL or REMOTE.

     3.  Data Forwarding.  This parameter describes the set  of  characters         Data Forwarding
         that,  when  typed  by  the  user,  will  cause X29PAD to transmit
         whatever data is in the input  buffer.   This  parameter  has  the
         following possible values:

         1.  No data forwarding character specified (disabled).

         2.  Alphanumerics (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)

         3.  Carriage Return

         4.  Escape Characters (ESC, BEL, ENQ, ACK)

         5.  Editing Characters (DEL, CAN, DC2)

         6.  Terminator Characters (ETX, EOT)
                                                                   Page B-2

         7.  Forms Control Characters (HT, LF, VT, FF)

         8.  All Other Control Characters

         Only the following combinations of the above are legal:

         1.  (1)

         2.  (3)

         3.  (3 and 4)

         4.  (3 and 6)

         5.  (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) - DEFAULT


     4.  Idle Timer.  This parameter controls  the  frequency  that  X29PAD         Idle Timer
         will  forward  data  in  the input buffer to the remote host.  The
         timer may either be DISABLED or be set to an  interval  from  0.05
         seconds  to  12.75  seconds  in  0.05 second increments.  The Idle
         Timer is DISABLED by default.

     5.  DTE to  Network  Flow  Control  (*).   This  parameter  determines         DTE to  Network  Flow  Control
         whether  X29PAD  can  use  XON/XOFF  to control data flow from the
         terminal.  X29PAD does not currently use this parameter.

     6.  PAD Service Signal Suppression (*).  This parameter determines  if         PAD Service Signal Suppression
         X29PAD   will  suppress  service  signals.   X29PAD  ignores  this
         parameter.

     7.  Action on Break.  This parameter specifies the action X29PAD takes         Action on Break
         when  the  user  types  the  BREAK-CHARACTER on the terminal.  The
         possible values are:

         1.  No action

         2.  X29PAD sends an interrupt to the remote DTE

         3.  X29PAD sends a reset to the remote DTE

         4.  X29PAD sends an Indication Break message to the remote DTE

         5.  X29PAD enters command mode

         6.  X29PAD discards output to the terminal (Parameter 8 set to 1)

         7.  Combination of 2, 4, and 6

         The default value for this parameter is RESET.

     8.  Discard Output.  This parameter determines if X29PAD will  display         Discard Output
         data from the remote host on the user's terminal or discard it.
                                                                   Page B-3

     9.  Carriage Return Padding (*).  This parameter controls  the  number         Carriage Return Padding
         of  nulls  X29PAD  should send after it sends a carriage return to
         the terminal.  X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    10.  Line Width  (*).   This  parameter  is  the  width  of  the  users         Line Width
         terminal.  X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    11.  Rate  (*).   This  parameter  contains  the  speed  of  the  users         Rate
         terminal.  X29PAD currently ignores this parameter.

    12.  Network to  DTE  Flow  Control  (*).   This  parameter  determines         Network to  DTE  Flow  Control

         determines  if  and  when  X29PAD  will  insert a linefeed after a
         carriage return in  the  data  stream.   This  parameter  has  the
         following values:

         1.  Never insert a linefeed after a carriage return.

         2.  Insert a linefeed after carriage returns sent to the terminal.

         The default for this parameter is to never insert a linefeed.

    14.  Linefeed Padding (*).  This parameter controls the number of nulls         Linefeed Padding

    15.  Local Editing.  This parameter controls the local editing  feature         Local Editing
         of  X29PAD.   This  parameter  has  two possible values.  If local
         editing is ENABLED, X29PAD will allow the user to edit any text in
         the  input  buffer  before it is passed on to the remote host.  If
         local editing is DISABLED, X29PAD will not allow local editing  to
         be  done.   Note  that  parameters  16,  17, and 18 are ignored by
         X29PAD if local editing is disabled.

         default  setting  for this parameter is CONTROL-U.  This parameter
         is ignored if LOCAL-EDITING is disabled.
