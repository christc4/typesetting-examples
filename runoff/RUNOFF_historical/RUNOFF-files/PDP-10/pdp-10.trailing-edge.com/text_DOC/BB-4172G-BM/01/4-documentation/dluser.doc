DLUSER.DOC -- Changes from V3(4) to V4(4)
January 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

DLUSER is a program which obtains identifying information  about  each
directory  on  a system and places it in a file.  The program can then
use this file to create the same directories later, in the event of  a
system rebuild.

DLUSER version 4(4) runs on Release 4 of TOPS-20.

DLUSER does not depend on any other software during its execution.

DLUSER  is  documented  in  the  DECSYSTEM-20  Operator's  Guide   and
DECSYSTEM-20 System Manager's Guide.
