RMS20.DOC -- V1(52)
May 1981


1.0  SUMMARY

This is Release 1 of RMS-10/20.   RMS  provides  multi-key  ISAM  file
support  for  COBOL-74/V12B.   The  components  of  RMS-10/20  are  as
follows:

     RMS       The run-time system of RMS-10/20.
     RMSUTL    RMS file manipulation utility.

RMS-20 requires release 4 of TOPS-20.  RMS  requires  version  12B  of
COBOL-74 or version 2.1 of BASIC-PLUS-TWO.

The relevant documentation is as follows:

     RMS Reference Manual (RMSREF.MEM on update tape)
     COBOL-74/V12B Language Manual, Appendix I



2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES -- N/A



3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  RMSUTL does not handle stream, sequential, or relative files.

     2.  Only multi-key ISAM files can be accessed from  COBOL.   OPEN
         statements for RMS files may not contain the ALLOWING clause.

     3.  RMSUTL does not have facilities to display or  change  packed
         decimal or double integer fields.

     4.  If certain  prolog  fields  are  clobbered,  RMS  will  abort
         opening  of  a  file.   There  are no facilities in RMSUTL to
         "quick open" a file.  Thus it is not possible to  "unclobber"
         fields like ORG with RMSUTL.

4.0 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Installing RMS

There are 4 save sets on the TOPS-20 Update tape:

     1.  Documentation
     2.  Binaries
     3.  Sources
     4.  UETP

There are files related to RMS in each of these save sets  along  with
files  for  other  utilities.   To  install  RMS,  you  should  do the
following:

     1.  Restore from  the  1st  save  set  to  your  designated  disk
         directory, and then print and read the following files:

              RMS20.DOC (This file)
              RMSREF.MEM (Reference Manual)

         The reference manual describes RMSUTL, RMS concepts, and  RMS
         status  codes.   It  is mostly of use to those who design and
         maintain RMS files.

     2.  Copy the following files from the 2nd save set, to SYS:   (or
         <RUN-directory> for testing).  These files are:

           B362LB.REL  ;Required to be on SYS: for linking with RMS
           RMS.EXE
           RMS.REL
           RMSCOB.EXE
           RMSUTL.EXE
           RMSINT.REL  ;Required to be on SYS: for relinking RMS.

         RMS is now ready to use.  If you are going to run UETP tests,
         do steps 3, and 4, otherwise go to step 5.

     3.  Copy the  UETP  modules,  from  the  4th  save  set,  to  the
         directory PS:<UETP.LIB>.  The UETP modules are:

           RMS.VER
           RMTMKI.CBL
           RMTNAM.UTL
           RMTOK.MST
           RMTOK.UTL

         This is a self-checking group of tests, run under UETP,  that
         exercise RMSUTL.

     4.  Run the UETP tests using the following procedure:

          @CONNECT <RUN-directory>       ;UNLESS RUN-directory IS SYS:
          @DEFINE DSK: DSK:,PS:<UETP.LIB>;SO AS TO FIND TESTS
          @RU UETP
          DEFAULT/DEPTH:VER
          ENABLE RMS
          BEGIN
          EXIT
          @DELETE RMS.LOG,RUN.LOG,EXCEPT.LOG

     5.  Run  your  own  tests  if  desired.    This   concludes   the
         installation.

     6.  If <RUN-directory> is  not  SYS:,  install  RMS  software  by
         giving the following command:

              COPY <RUN-directory>*.* SYS:*.*

4.2  Rebuilding RMS

Maintenance on RMS will be done via DDT patches and AUTOPATCH.  If  in
the future, you use AUTOPATCH, you will need to rebuild the software.

Included on this Update tape  are  linkable  files  for  creating  RMS
executable (.EXE) files.

To rebuild RMS you should copy, from the 3rd save set,  the  following
files to an empty directory:

     RMS201.REL
     RMS2C1.LNK
     RMS2L1.CCL
     RMS2P1.REL
     RMS2S1.LNK
     RMS2U1.LNK
     RMS2U1.REL

You should then follow procedures documented in the AUTOPATCH kit.
