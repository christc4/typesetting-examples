DC76.DOC -- Changes from V10 to V21
September 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of the DC76 code is coupled to the 6.02  release  of  the
TOPS10  monitor.  This version implements no new features but corrects
several deficiencies in version 10.  This version has not been  tested
with  pre-6.02 monitors although there is every reason to believe that
such a combination would operate successfully.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     MCO# 4965 - Eliminates  input  of  garbage  character  from  2741
                 terminal in APL mode when attention key is depressed.

     MCO# 4987 - Enables typeout of DC76 messages in upper/lower case.

     MCO# 5271 - Provides the ablilty to generate  backslash  on  2741
                 terminals by using ^/.

     MCO# 5274 - Corrects operation of TIDY  mode  on  2741  terminals
                 with element type 963 to conform to documentation.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs or deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

First, for  non-auto  baud  lines,  build  a  parameter  file  C76.P11
defining transmit and receive line speeds.

These definitions are of the form:

          T<line#>XS==speed  ;for xmit speed
          T<line#>RS==speed  ;for receive speed

     e.g.,
          T01XS==^D1200
          T01RS==^D150
D7621.DOC                                                       Page 3


sets line #1 with a transmit speed of 1200 baud and a receive speed of
150 baud.

Note:  This inhibits the auto baud detect feature for this line.

The DC76 code is assembled using MACDLX.  For  example  to  produce  a
binary and listing:

          .R MACDLX
          *DC76.BIN,DC76.LST/CREF=C76.P11,DC76.P11

The file DC76.BIN is loaded into the PDP-11 using BOOT11.  For example
to load a DC76 on port 0 of the DL10:

          .R BOOT11
          *FILE:DC76.BIN/PORT:0

Complete documentation on BOOT11 is found in Notebook 10.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     MCO# 4909 - Adds check and associated error trap for overflow  of
                 the "to-10" message queue.

     MCO# 5016 - Increases timeout to prevent  spurious  "DECsystem-10
                 not running" messages.

     MCO# 5064 - Changes dataset logic to  hang  up  a  line  only  on
                 command from the -10.

     MCO# 5257 - Prevents DC76 from hanging on DM11-BB failure.

     MCO# 5317 - Reverts line to auto baud if framing error on a  2741
                 is  not  a  break  character.   This  prevents  ASCII
                 terminals from getting locked into 2741 mode if their
                 speed is taken to be 134.5 baud.

DC76.DOC -- V10
SEPTEMBER 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This is the first release of the DC76 code.

This software is designed to support any standard DC76  configuration.
The code does not require assembly-time specification of configuration
parameters such as number of lines, etc.

DC76 features include:

     -  Control of up to 128 full-duplex  or  full-duplex  with  local
        copy asynchronous lines.  These may be local or dial-up lines.

     -  Individual line speeds program-selectable  from  50  to  9,600
        baud.

     -  Split-speed (transmit/receive) operation program-selectable on
        a per-line basis.

     -  Automatic baud detection for 110,  134.5,  150,  and  300-baud
        lines.

     -  ASCII, EBCDIC,  APL,  or  Correspondence  Codes  independently
        selectable on each line.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The DC76 program is distributed as a binary file (DC76.BIN).

Use BOOT11 to load the DC76.  If the DC76 is on DL10 port  0  use  the
following commands:

          .R BOOT11
          /CLEAR/PORT:0
          DC76.BIN/PORT:0
D7610.DOC                                                       Page 5


Further information on BOOT11 may be found in the software notebooks.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.



6.0  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS


6.1  Auto-Baud Detection

All DC76 lines will initially be defined  as  auto-baud  lines.   This
means  that the DC76 will scan incoming characters until it finds what
appears to be a carriage return.  When  the  DC76  determines  a  line
speed the monitor will type out:

          PLEASE LOGIN OR ATTACH

At this point SET TTY SPEED commands may be used to redefine the  baud
rate.

At times it may be desirable to initialize a line at a  specific  baud
rate  rather  than  auto-baud.   This may be done by using the TTY.INI
file and the INITIA program.


6.2  Dataset Lines

All dataset lines must be declared to MONGEN.   Lines  which  are  not
declared will answer and then hang up 30 seconds later.


6.3  2741 Lines

If the DC76 detects a baud rate of 134.5, it will define the line as a
2741  line with default element type.  At this point a SET TTY ELEMENT
command may be  used  to  define  the  element  being  used.   If  the
PLEASE LOGIN  or ATTACH message is garbled, the system may not be able
to recognize the SET TTY  command.   To  eleviate  this  problem  type
LOGINCARRIAGE  return>.   This will give the system enough information
to be able to decode SET TTY commands.
