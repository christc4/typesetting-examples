1.0  SUMMARY


     1.  Microcode version 2(400) is the twelfth release of  the  KL10
         microcode.   Microcode  version  2(400)  appears as KLX.MCB
         only.  It supports a model B KL10 with or without  MCA25  for
         TOPS-10 V7.02 only. This is the  seventh  release  of  the
         KL10  microcode  that supports   an  'Extended  KL10'  described
         in  the  Hardware Reference Manual.


     2.  The KL10 microcode is  not  dependent  on  any  monitor,  but
         because  of  hardware  differences  between  the  various -10
         processors, a monitor must  be  built  specifically  for  the
         KL10.  KL10 microcode version 2(400) has been tested with the
         TOPS-10 release 7.02 monitor.

3.0  RELATED DOCUMENTATION


The microcode is implicitly documented in the System Reference Manual,
in  that  it  is  an  implementation  of  a  PDP-10.   The  only other
documentation is in the listing and prints of the KL10 processor.
