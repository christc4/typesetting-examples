1.0  SUMMARY

CTHNRT is the user agent for DECnet inter-system remote virtual terminal
service.   CTHNRT  supports Digital's heterogeneous inter-system command
terminal protocol, CTERM.  This protocol supports a common base level of
terminal  processing  support  between  various  of  Digital's operating
systems.

CTHNRT  also  attempts  to  provide  some  compatability  with  previous
(homogeneous)   inter-system   remote   terminal  protocols,  but  these
alternate protocols are not supported in CTHNRT, and may well be removed
in a future release of the software.

CTHNRT has been tested on  KL10  and  KS10  processors  under  the  7.03
version of the monitor.  This is a new product, which is intended solely
for use under the 7.03 monitor.  The ancestor  product,  NRT,  is  still
supported under 7.02; however, CTHNRT fully supersedes NRT for 7.03.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The SET HOSTESS command  in  the  7.03  monitor  will  run  CTHNRT  when
attempting  to  connect  to  a  DECnet node, rather than running the NRT
program as in 7.02.  CTHNRT uses  a  two-character  switch  sequence  to
enter  its  command  mode, rather than a single 'escape' character as in
NRT.  CTHNRT does not slave the line, since 7.03 has  better  facilities
for terminal control than previous monitor releases.



2.1  Command (RESCAN) Changes

After the destination node name is read, CTHNRT will accept one  of  the
folowing switches (on the same line):

      o  /CTERM Allow only a CTERM-mode connect.

      o  /NRT   Allow only a NRT-mode connect.

      o  /OLD   A synonym for /NRT.

Note that NRT-mode connects are supported only to TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.



2.2  Command (NRT_EXIT) Changes


Certain of the subcommands in CTHNRT's command mode  have  changed  from
those of NRT.

2.2.1  Pass Command - The Pass command is no longer  needed,  since  the
use  of  a switch sequence solves the problem of having a character that
cannot be typed to the remote system.



2.2.2  Monitor Command - The Monitor  command  does  not  actually  exit
CTHNRT.  Instead, the 7.03 facility of having multiple contexts in a job
(CTXSER) is utilized to PUSH out of the program.  To continue the remote
session, use the POP command.



2.2.3  Change Command - The   Change   command   prompts   for   a   new
two-character  switch  sequence, not a single 'escape' character.  Since
the Monitor command to CTHNRT merely suspends the program,  rather  than
stopping it, the REENTER command of TOPS-10 is no longer available as an
alternate form of this command.

The related code for performance analysis  and  the  associated  feature
test have also been removed.



2.3  SWITCH.INI Changes

CTHNRT looks for a line in SWITCH.INI labeled CTHNRT.  If one is  found,
it is examined for certain switches, as detailed below.



2.3.1  /SWCHR1:ch - This switch  changes  the  first  character  of  the
switch  sequence  to  the  specified  value.   The  syntax  for the <ch>
argument is this:

      o  nnn - an octal  number,  specifying  the  ASCII  code  for  the
         character.

      o  "c" - a  quoted  character,  possibly  additionally  quoted  by
         control-V (^V).

      o  c - a literal character.  Use of this form is  discouraged,  as
         it may not be supported in future releases.

The default first character of the switch sequence, if  this  switch  is
not found in SWITCH.INI, is control-backslash (^\).

The /SW1 switch is recognized as a synonym for the /SWCHR1 switch.
CTHNRT -- CTERM server for 7.03, version 5(312) -- December 1985  Page 4


2.3.2  /SWCHR2:ch - This switch changes  the  second  character  of  the
switch  sequence  to  the  specified  value.   The  syntax  for the <ch>
argument is identical to that for the /SWCHR1 switch.

The default second character of the switch sequence, if this  switch  is
not found in SWITCH.INI, is carriage-return (^M).

The /SW2 switch is recognized as a synonym for the /SWCHR2 switch.



2.3.3  /MODE:level - This switch allows the user to  set  the  expertise
level.  The legal values are:

      o  NOVICE - Full prompting in command mode.  This is the default.

      o  NOTIFY - Ring the terminal's bell  when  awaiting  command-mode
         input.   This  can  be  useful  when running a display-oriented
         program on the remote system, when it is desirable to keep from
         changing the display.

      o  EXPERT - Give  no  notice  when  command-mode  input  is  being
         processed.

Note that the CHANGE command will prompt for  the  new  switch  sequence
even  in  EXPERT  and  NOTIFY  modes.   The  screen's  display is always
modified in this case.

Unrecognized values to this switch are treated  as  though  /MODE:NOVICE
had been specified.



2.4  Debugging

The debugging of network messages in CTHNRT does not require the use  of
DNSNUP  and  DNTATL.  See the comments in CTHNRT.MAC about debugging for
instructions on the use of the built-in debugging aids.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There  are  several   known   incompatibilites   between   the   various
implementations  of the CTERM protocol.  While sometimes annoying, these
are not the result of bugs in CTHNRT.  See the DECnet  BEWARE  file  for
details.

There are no known bugs in CTHNRT.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

CTHNRT searches JOBDAT, MACTEN, MACSYM, and UUOSYM.  It  loads  with  no
other modules.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to the revision history in CTHNRT.MAC.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Implement code to support command-line editing in VMS V4.

Support the VMS-private Read Verify message so that TDMS and FMS can  be
used remotely.

Add a command-line  qualifier  to  enable  the  logging  of  the  remote
terminal session to a file.

Add timestamps of some sort to the trace file produced  by  the  NRTNSP:
debugging facility.
