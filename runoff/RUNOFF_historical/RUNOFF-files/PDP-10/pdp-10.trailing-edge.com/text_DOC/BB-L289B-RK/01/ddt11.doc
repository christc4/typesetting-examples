Subj:   DDT11

DDT11 Version 6(67) is supplied on the RSX20F SWSKIT.  This  version
of DDT11 will:

     1.  Run under TOPS10 and allow the examination of running DN8X,
         DN6X,  DN92,  and  RSX20F  front  ends.  Dumps from BOOT11,
         DTELDR and NETLDR can also be looked at.

     2.  Run under TOPS20 and allow the  examination  of  a  running
         RSX20F  front end and read dumps from RSX20F and DN6X front
         ends.


There is a bug in the  "/NODE"  switch.   When  using  the  /NODE:nn
switch,  after  giving  it the node number(nn), DDT11 will come back
and give you the "Input:" prompt again.  There is  a  fix  for  this
problem.

In routine SETNOD, after the call to CLRMEM, insert a JFCL.

This will fix this problem and let you look at running nodes.
