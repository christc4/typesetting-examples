	This is the TOPS-20 Cobol and Fortran callable DECnet interface. The
interface allows the user to access the network via calls to macro
subroutines. All subroutines are contained in the file DECNET.MAC which
is conditionally assembled for either Cobol or Fortran.
	Please consider this documentation and the subroutine itself
as examples for your own implementations. This is unsupported code which
has not been thoroughly tested.
  The interface consists of a series of routines, all of which begin with "NF".
These routines are:

	NFGND - inquire about asynchronous network events
	NFOPN - open a logical link (accomplish a connection)
	NFINF - get information about the other end of a logical link
	NFACC - accept a connection
	NFREJ - reject a connection
	NFSND - send data over a logical link
	NFRCV - receive data over a logical link
	NFINT - send an interrupt message over a logical link
	NFRCI - receive an interrupt message over a logical link
	NFCLS - close a logical link (release its resources for reuse)        

The following sections describe each entry point.  A few general concepts
are described below.

		TASK - TO - TASK    OVERVIEW

	A Cobol program on a DECsystem-20 can communicate with another
program written in any language on any system which supports the
task to task DECnet capability. The Cobol program on the TOPS-20
system sends data to and from the other program in the network as if the
network connection were a file.
	The following is a typical sequence in which two programs
communicate using the DECnet task-to-task capability.

PROGRAM A			PROGRAM B
---------			---------

DECLARE THIS PROGRAM
TO BE AVAILABLE FOR
CONNECTIONS.

		<-----		ASK FOR A CONNECTION TO
				PROGRAM A.

CHECK PROGRAM B'S
IDENTITY AND SECURITY
INFO AND ACCEPT THE
CONNECTION.	----->

INPUT AND/OR	----->		INPUT AND/OR
OUTPUT.		<-----		OUTPUT.

		<-----		BREAK THE CONNECTION
				AND FREE NETWORK RESOURCES.

FREE NETWORK RESOURCES.
 
	In this example, program A is a passive or target task because it
waits for connection requests. Program B is an active or source task
because it makes the connection request. Either task can send or
receive data, or both; the connection (logical link) is full
duplex. Either task can disconnect the logical link.
	Also, a program can participate in more than one logical link
at once as either a passive or active task or both.
		NFOPN - Open a logical link


CALL NFOPN USING NETLN,TYPE,DESCRIPTOR,BYTES,WAIT,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - 1 word comp item to be set by the routine, which will
	identify the logical link to other interface routines.  This value
	is called the "logical name" in other routine descriptions.

TYPE -	a literal or 1 word comp item which specifies the type of the link.
	A value of 0 means the link is to be opened as a "passive" link,
	i.e., one which has to receive connections from another process.
	The task which owns a passive link is called the server or target task.
	A value of 1 means an "active" link is to be opened, i.e.,
	a connection is to be initiated from this end to a specified target.
	The task which owns the active link is called the source task.
	The descriptor for a TYPE 0 link must specify SRV: as the device name
	The descriptor for a TYPE 1 link must specify DCN: as the device name.


DESCRIPTOR - a display-7 item containing the complete TOPS-20
	     file specification which defines the characteristics of the
	     passive object on this end (for a passive link) or the remote
	     target (for an active link).

BYTES -	a literal or comp item specifying the byte size. The
	valid byte sizes are 7,8, and 36. If byte size 7 is specified
	the data items sent and received must be entirely display-7
	with no imbedded comp items.
	If the byte size is 8, the data item must be
	any data type containing 4 8 bit bytes per 36 bit word. Byte size of
	8 is used to communicate with non DECsystem-20 nodes. A byte
	size of 36 is used to transfer records of any type where both
	sides of the link are DECsystem-20s. Note that the byte counts
	are in units of the byte size. i.e. one 36 bit byte contains
	5 display-7 characters.

WAIT  - a literal or 1 word comp item interpreted as a wait flag.
	If the value is 0, NFOPN
	will return before the connect has completed.  In this case, the return
	code will be 0, and the user must wait for the connect
	to complete using the NFGND interface routine before using the link.
	If the value is 1, NFOPN will wait for the connect to complete
	before returning, and will pass a return code describing the success
	or failure of the connect.  If NFOPN waits for the connect, NFGND   
	will not return "connect" status for the link.                        
        Note that upon successful completion of NFOPN for a passive task which
        waits, the logical link is still not connected. The request must
	still be accepted with NFACC.

RETCOD - a one word comp item in which the status of the subroutine call
	is returned:

0 	The connection was successful (successful so far, if WAIT is 0).
	If a passive link was requested, routine NFINF may be used to
	find about the remote process.  For a passive link, the connection
	must still be accepted or rejected by the user.

1	Too many logical links are open for this task or no more interrupt
	channels are available. The connection was unsuccessful.

2	The connection was rejected by the target or aborted before the
	open process could complete.  The reject (or abort) code may be
	acquired through the NFINF interface routine.

>2	The error code is the standard TOPS-20 JSYS error code returned
	as the result of an unsuccessful JSYS.


Description:

If TYPE = 0 the local task will be declared as a server task to
TOPS-20. If WAIT is 1, the routine will wait for
a remote process to connect, and return when this occurs or when the system
declares it impossible.  The routine will not accept or reject the connection.

If TYPE = 1, a connection is attempted to the specified target object.  If
WAIT is 0, a success-so-far or failure value is returned at this time, and
the user is responsible for detecting the ultimate fate of the connect through
NFGND.  If WAIT is 1, the routine will wait for the ultimate success or
failure of the connection and will return an appropriate value.

In any case, the contents of NETLN will be meaningful
to the user only if NFOPN returns a 0 value.

		NFGND - get information on network events


CALL NFGND USING NETLN,WAIT,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item which contains the network logical name returned by
	NFOPN, or -1 for "all active links".

WAIT  - a literal or 1 word comp item used as a wait flag.
	When WAIT is 1, the routine
	does not return until a network event occurs on the specified link;
	it never returns a value of 0.  When WAIT is 0, the routine returns
	a positive value if a network event has occurred since the last time
	NFGND was called for the link; if no event has occurred, it returns
	0.

RETCOD - status returned by this subroutine:

0	No network events have occurred.
1	A connect event has occurred.  For an active link, a connect request
	has been accepted.  For a passive link, a connect request has been     
	received from a process.
2	The link has been aborted, if open, or has been rejected, if an active 
	link being opened.  Subsequent calls to NFGND prior to closing the    
	link with NFCLS will get this code only.
3	An interrupt message has been received and is available to be read.
4	Data may have been received; a read should be issued.                  
5	The link has been disconnected.  Note that this indication will not be
	returned until all other network events have been reported.
> 5	TOPS-20 JSYS error code.

Description:

This routine may be called by the user to poll for asynchronous network events.
There are five such events described: connect, interrupt data available, data
available, disconnect and abort.  The interface together with the network
software will store up these events until the user asks about them, after which
time it will forget about them.  If more than one kind of event has occurred
when a user calls NFGND, only the one with the lowest return value will be
reported; the interface will remember the other event types for subsequent
calls to the routine.  If more than one event of the same type occurs, they
will all be lumped together into one notification.  (Any further events of that
type after the user has called NFGND will of course be identified.)  There
can be only one connect and one disconnect event for any link; however, more
than one interrupt or data event may occur.  Therefore, a user using NFGND
should do non-waiting reads until informed that no data is available, in order
to get everything that is available.
If this routine is called with a zero value of NETLN, the first network data   
event encountered on any active link will be reported.  NETLN will be set to   
the logical name for the link whose event is begin reported.                   
	This routine is used in conjunction with other routines
with the wait flag off in order to control multiple logical links:
1.  Call NFGND, possibly with the WAIT flag on to suspend the process until
    network activity.

2.  NFGND will return a code from 1 to 5, indicating the most urgent network
    event pending.  Call the proper routine to process that event:
	1 - NFINF, then NFACC or NFREJ
	2 or 5 - NFCLS
	3 - NFRCI
	4 - NFRCV

3.  Process the information acquired from the routine.  When you are ready to
    process another event, call NFGND again.


		NFINF - get information on the remote user


CALL NFINF USING NETLN,TYPE,COUNT,AREA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item which is a logical name of an open link (see NFOPN)

TYPE - a literal or 1 word comp item designating the type of information
	requested.
	1 - remote node name

	4 - remote object descriptor
	5 - remote process' user ID
	6 - remote process' password
	7 - remote process' account information
	8 - remote process' optional data
	9 - abort code

COUNT - a 1 word comp item which contain the length of the data
	returned.

AREA - a display-7 item where the requested information is to
       be put.

RETCOD - the status returned by the subroutine

0	Success; information returned in AREA=>
1	this information is not available for this type of link
2	Type is out of range.
> 2	TOPS-20 JSYS error

Description:

The information available through this entry pertains to a "running" link,
or to a passive link which has received a connection.

	Data types 2-7 are available only for passive links.
	Data type 8 (optional data) may  also be requested on:
	      . a link that has gotten a disconnect event but has not been     
		disconnected from this end (NFCLS), in which     
		case the optional data returned will be that sent in the       
		disconnect message; or                                         
	      . an active link whose connect request has been rejected, in     
		which case the reject optional data will be returned.          
		NFACC - accept a connection


CALL NFACC USING NETLN,COUNT,DATA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item identifying the logical name of the link (see NFOPN).

COUNT - a literal or 1 word comp item specifying the number of characters
	of optional data
	to be sent in the acceptance message.  If this value is 0, no optional
	data is sent.

DATA - a literal or display-7 item containing the optional data to be sent.
	If COUNT is 0, this parameter is ignored.

RETCOD -a 1 word comp item containing status returned by the subroutine:

0	The connection has been accepted
> 0	error code returned by a TOPS-20 JSYS.

Description:

This routine accepts a connection received on a passive link which has been
OPNed and has had a connect event.
		NFREJ - reject a connection


CALL NFREJ USING NETLN,CODE,COUNT,DATA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item indentifying the logical name of the link (see NFOPN).

CODE - a literal or 1 word comp item specifying the abort or reject code.

COUNT - a literal or 1 word comp item specifying the number of characters
	of optional data to send. A value of zero indicates that no
	optional data is to be sent.

DATA - a literal or display-7 item containing the optional data to send.
	If COUNT is 0 this parameter will be ignored.

RETCOD - a one word comp item in which the status of the subroutine is returned.

0	Connection rejected successfully
> 0	the TOPS-20 JSYS error code for a JSYS error.

Description:

This routine rejects a connection on a passive link which has gotten a connect
event.  The link specified by NETLN will not
be available for use after this routine is called, whether it succeeds or not
		NFSND - send data over a link


CALL NFSND USING NETLN,COUNT,DATA,EOM-FLG,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item containing the logical name of the link (see NFOPN).

COUNT - a literal or 1 word comp item defining the number of characters
	of data to send. This value must be greater than 0.

DATA - a literal or display-7 item containing the data to send if the byte
	size is 7 or 8, or any item name if the byte size is 36.


EOM-FLG - a 1 word comp item used as a "message mode" flag.  If the value is 1,
	  the data will be sent in message mode. If the value is 0, the data
 	  will be sent in non-message mode.

RETCOD - a 1 word comp item in which the status of the subroutine is returned.

0	Data sent successfully
> 0	TOPS-20 JSYS error code

Description:

This routine sends data over the specified logical link.
		NFRCV - receive data over a link


CALL NFRCV USING NETLN,COUNT,DATA,MSG-FLG,WAIT,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item identifying the logical name for the link (see NFOPN).

COUNT - a 1 word comp item specifying the number of characters to
	receive.  This is a maximum value if the read is in message mode (see
	below) and an actual value otherwise. In some cases,
	COUNT on return will contain the actual number of characters read.

DATA - a display-7 item which is to receive the    
       data.  This area  must be at least COUNT characters long.

MSG-FLG - a literal or 1 word comp item used as a "message mode" flag.
	  If the value is 1,
	  one complete message (or remnant of a message) will be read.  If
	  the value
	  is 0, exactly COUNT characters will be read, if any are at all.

WAIT  - a literal or 1 word comp item used as a wait flag. When WAIT is 1,
	the routine will
	not return until the requested message or the requested number of 
	characters have been received (or the read fails).  When WAIT is 0
	and MSG-FLG is 0, the routine will return either the requested number
	of characters or an error code indicating that that amount is not cur-
	rently available. Since the monitor will only report the number of
	characters
	available in the next buffer, if the sender has sent a
	small message in message mode and then a large message
	such that sufficient characters are available, but not in
	the next buffer, then the caller of NFRCV will still be
	told that there are insufficient characters. When WAIT is 0
	and MSG-FLG is 1, the routine will
	return either a message or fragment or an error code indicating that no
	message is available.  In any case, when WAIT is 0 the routine will
	return promptly.

RETCOD - status returned by the subroutine:

0	The requested amount of data has been read into DATA=>.
	Count contains the number of characters read.
1	Link was disconnected or aborted before requested data could be read,  
	count contains the number of characters successfully read before
	the disconnect or abort occured.
2	An interrupt message has been received. The interrupt message must be
	read with NFRCI before more data can be received. No data is returned
	if this status is sent. Count is zero.
	Note: If you call NFRCV with wait in non-message mode and an interrupt
	message arrives for you, you will not get return code 2 until the
	next time you call NFRCV. If the cooperating task does not send
	enough data to satisfy the waiting NFRCV your task will not see
	the interrupt message.
3	Overrun: the available message or fragment being read in message mode
	is longer than COUNT characters. Count contains the size of the large
	message.
4	The requested amount of data was not immediately available.
	Count contains the number of bytes currently available.
> 4	TOPS-20 JSYS error.
Description:

This routine reads data over the specified logical link.  If message mode is
specified, the routine will read exactly one DECNET message (terminated by a
DECNET segment with the EOM bit on).  If non-message mode is specified
characters will be read from as many messages
as necessary to get the requested number of characters, and the last (or only)
message read from will not necessarily be exhausted.  If a read in non-message
mode is followed by a read in message mode, the second read may get a message
fragment, i.e., the last part of a message minus what the first read took out
of it.
		NFINT - send an interrupt message


CALL NFINT USING NETLN,COUNT,DATA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item identifying the logical name for the link (see NFOPN).

COUNT - a literal or 1 word comp item defining the number of characters of
	data to send.
	This value must be greater than 0 and no greater than 16.

DATA - a literal or display-7 item containing the data to send.

RETCOD - a 1 word comp item in which the status is returned:

0	Data sent successfully
> 0	TOPS-20 JSYS error code.

Description:

This routine sends an interrupt message over the specified logical link.  Unlike
routine NFSND, the data are always sent in message mode, and thus a prompt at-
tempt to send the data is guaranteed.  Data sent in this mode are not sent in
sync with data sent by NFSND; sequencing of messages between the two streams
is not guaranteed.
Only one interrupt message can be transmitted over a logical link at once.
		NFRCI - receive an interrupt message


CALL NFRCI USING NETLN,COUNT,DATA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item identifying the logical name for the lnik (see NFOPN).

COUNT - a 1 word comp item value specifying the number of characters read.
	This value will be updated on successful completion of the routine.

DATA - a display-7  data area to receive the interrupt
       message.  This area must be at least 16 characters long.

RETCOD - a 1 word comp item in which the status is returned:

0	Interrupt message received successfully; COUNT contains message length.
-1	No message available at this time (WAIT = 0 only)
> 0	TOPS-20 JSYS error.

Description:

This routine reads a single interrupt message on the specified logical link.
Receipt of an interrupt message is an asynchronous
event. The normal
way to access asynchronous events is through the NFGND interface routine.  
NFGND will announce interrupt messages before data messages; such messages
must be read by this routine before NFGND will announce any lower-level
events (data messages or disconnection).
Note that NFRCV will return error code 2 and refuse to return data
if an interrupt message is available wich has not been read by NFRCI.

		NFCLS - close a logical link


CALL NFCLS USING NETLN,TYPE,CODE,COUNT,DATA,RETCOD

Parameters:

NETLN - a 1 word comp item identifying the logical name for the link (see NFOPN).

TYPE - a literal or 1 word comp item describing the type of link
	disconnect requested.  If the
       value is 0, the link will be synchronously disconnected. DECnet
       will quiesce activity on the link before disconnecting it.  If the   
       value is 1, the link will be aborted; this method of disconnecting the 
       link is immediate and gives no guarantees except that the link will
       go away immediately.

CODE - a literal or 1 word comp item specifying the disconnect or abort code
       to pass to the the other end of the link.
       Code may be non-zero only if TYPE is 1.

COUNT - a literal or 1 word comp item specifying the number of characters
	of optional data to
	be sent in the disconnect/abort message.  If this value is 0, no option-
	al data are sent.

DATA - a display-7 item or literal containing the optional data to be sent.
	if count is 0, this parameter is ignored.


RETCOD - a 1 word comp item which gets status
0	The specified link has been disconnected 
> 0	TOPS-20 JSYS error code.

Description:

This routine disconnects a link.  A synchronous disconnect (TYPE=0) in theory  
acts as a pipeline marker which will disconnect the link after all transmissions
outstanding have been completed.  An abort instantaneously disconnects the link
from the local end, as far as the user is concerned.  DECNET specifies an abort
code to be passed in either case, but this feature is not universally implemen-
ted in MACRO interfaces.
This routine may be called either before or after receipt of a disconnect from
the other end.

Network event indications are cleared at various times, depending on the event.
Connect and disconnect (NOT abort) are cleared when reported.  Abort is never
cleared; any further invocation of NFGND for an aborted link will always get
the "abort" code (until the link is disconnected by the user, in which case the
NETLN becomes an invalid parameter).  A data event is cleared only when there
is no more data to be gotten at the moment.  An interrupt event is cleared
immediately for all implementations that allow only one outstanding interrupt
message (at the moment, that's everybody); for other implementations, it is
treated like a data event.
