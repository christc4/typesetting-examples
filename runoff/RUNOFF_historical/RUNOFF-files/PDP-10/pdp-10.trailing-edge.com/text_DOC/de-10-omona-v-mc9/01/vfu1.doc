    1.0 SUMMARY

    1.1 MAKVFU provides support for  the  programmable  Direct  Access
          Vertical  Format Unit (DAVFU) feature on the LP100/LP07 Line
          Printer  subsystem.   This  feature  relieves  the  computer
          operator  from  the  time consumming, manual installation of
          the proper vertical format using a paper  tape  reader.   It
          also  reduces  the  risk  of  running  a  print job with the
          incorrect vertical format.

    1.1.1 The MAKVFU program produces a binary VFU  file.   This  file
          describes  the  vertical  formats  for  8 seperate channels.
          Each channel corresponds to a particular non-printable ASCII
          character.   These  characters  are  called vertical control
          codes, and are related to the 8 channels as follows:

          Channel   Character           Ascii Value(octal)

          1         Form Feed           14
          2         Device Control 0    20
          3         Device Control 1    21
          4         Device Control 2    22
          5         Device Control 3    23
          6         Device Control 4    24
          7         Vertical Tab        13
          8         Line Feed           12

    1.1.2 The MAKVFU commands permit the user to define special  print
          formats  for  each of the 8 channel/ character pairs.  These
          characters are imbedded into text files  sent  to  the  line
          printer to format the printer output.

    1.1.3 The binary DAVFU image is loaded into the LP07 using PIP  in
          image  mode.   All  files output to the LP07 use the formats
          specified by the most recent DAVFU load.  Thus, the standard
          DAVFU  format  is  restored  by  loading  the standard DAVFU
          binary image again with PIP in image mode.

    1.2 This is the first release of  MAKVFU.   This  release  has  no
          known  deficiencies.  It was developed under 6.03 and tested
          under 6.01 (as of 7/9/76).  PIP in image mode is required to
          load the DAVFU.  There are no other dependencies.

    1.3 MAKVFU is documented in the following publications:

    2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

          Not applicable  for  a  new  release.   See  LP100  Software
          Installation  Guide  for  a  full  description  of  the user
          interface.

    3.0 BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

          THE DAVFU feature has not  been  incorporated  into  LPTSPL.
          Thus,  the operator must manually load the line printer with
          the new DAVFU format before it can be used.  The user  at  a
          terminal cannot specify a command of the form:

                         .PRI FILENAM.EXT/FORM:CHECKS

          and expect LPTSPL to automatically load in FORMS.VFU for the
          one  job  and  then  restore  NORMAL.VFU  when  the  job  is
          completed.  The operator must do this manually with PIP.

    4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

          See chapter 2 of the LP100 Software Installation Guide for a
          complete description of the installation instructions.

    5.0  INTERNAL PROGRAM CHANGES

          Not applicable for a new release.
