WTBOOT.DOC -- Changes from V5 to V6(11)
April 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of the release of V6 of WTBOOT is  to  support  RH20'S  on
KL10'S.   If  the  feature test switch FTKL10 is off (default is off),
assembly and loading of WTBOOT with BOOTS.REL produces a WTBOOT  which
is functionally identical to WTBOOT V5.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The distributed version of WTBOOT will write a  BOOTS  on  disk  packs
which  is  functionally equivalent to the one written on disk packs by
V5.  Version 6 has been modified so as not to write a readin loader on
block 0 of a disk pack if it is being run on a KL10 unless it is asked
to do so.  In dialogue mode V6 of WTBOOT  differs  slightly  from  V5.
The  "readin  loader"  question  now  accepts the answer of "none", in
which case it will not write block 0 of the disk pack.  If the feature
test  switch  FTKL10  is set to 0 this is the only change from V5.  If
FTKL10 is set to 1, WTBOOT must be loaded with both  RH10/RP04  BOOTS,
and RH20/RP04 BOOTS.  In non-dialogue mode this version of WTBOOT will
write RH10 BOOTS on packs which are on RH10'S, and RH20 BOOTS on packs
which  are  on  RH20'S.   In dialogue mode the answer to which kind of
BOOTS is to be written can be answered "R2", in  which  case  it  will
write RH20 BOOTS, or "RP" in which case it will write RH10 BOOTS.  The
distributed versions of WTBOOT, WABOOT, and  WIBOOT  are  functionally
identical  to  those  distributed  with V5.  WLBOOT has been assembled
with FTKL10=1 and non-dialogue mode, so that it will write RH10  BOOTS
or RH20 BOOTS on the disk packs.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

A feature test switch, FTKL10, has  been  added  to  WTBOOT  which  if
turned on (defaults off) allows the selection of RH10 or RH20 BOOTS.

WTBOOT.DOC -- Changes from V3 to V4
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

The purpose of the release of  version  4  of  WTBOOT  is  to  support
version  20  of BOOTS (making the conversion from monitors in SAV file
format to monitors in EXE file format as painless  as  possible).   If
the  feature  test  switch  STDWTB is on (default is on), assembly and
loading  of  WTBOOT  with  BOOTS.REL  produces  a  WTBOOT   which   is
functionally identical to WTBOOT version 3.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The distributed version of WTBOOT.SAV will write a BOOTS on disk packs
which  is  functionally equivalent to the one written on disk packs by
version 3.  Namely, a version of BOOTS which will read and write  .SAV
format  files from or to fixed head disks and RP02's or RP03's.  Also,
included in this distribution are two programs  called  WABOOT  (which
writes  a  version  of  BOOTS  which  will  work on both KA10 and KI10
processors) and WIBOOT (which writes a version  of  BOOTS  which  will
only work on KI10 processors but which is capable of dumping more than
256K) which will at the operators option carry  on  a  dialogue  which
allows the operator to request 1 of 3 things to selectively be written
on blocks 4-7 of each disk pack mounted on the system or to  bypass  a
disk  pack  not writing anything on blocks 4-7.  The options which are
available include writing a version of BOOTS which can read/write  EXE
format files from/to RP02/RP03 packs, writing a version of BOOTS which
can read/write EXE format files from/to RP04 packs or  writing  zeroes
in  blocks  4-7  of  the  pack (the monitor will ignore this pack when
attempting to read in  BOOTS  on  a  407  restart.   In  addition,  in
dialogue  mode  will also ask if the read-in BOOTS bootstrap should be
written in 18 bit format or in 22 bit format on block 0 of  each  RS04
or  RP04 in the system.  Finally, this distribution includes a program
called WLBOOT which will write a version of BOOTS which only works  on
the KL10 or all the RP04 packs mounted on the system.

Caution:  The version of BOOTS which will be written  onto  block  4-7
will only read/write EXE format files, i.e., it will not read or write
old format SAV files, and it will only be able to read from  or  write
to  the one type of controller which it was configured for, i.e., RP10
-RP02/RP03 drives, or RH10 - RP04 drives.   In  the  normal  case,  an
installation  will  have  one  type of controller or the other but not
both so normally, the version of BOOTS which supports that  controller
would  be  written  on  blocks  4-7  of  all  packs.   However,  if an
installation has both RP10s with RP02/RP03 drives and RH10s with  RP04
drives,  it  is  recommended that the version of BOOTS which reads and
writes on the packs where the monitor is normally kept and crashes are
normally  dumped  be written on blocks 4-7 of all packs.  For example,
if the installation has both RP03 and RP04 packs but  the  monitor  is
normally  dumped  from  DSKA and crashes are normally dumped onto DSKA

which is a 2 pack RP04 file structure, it  is  recommended  that  RP04
BOOTS  be  written  on blocks 4-7 of all the disk packs on the system.
If the operator chooses not to enter the dialogue  mode,  WTBOOT  will
write  a  default  version of BOOTS onto blocks 4-7 of every disk pack
mounted on the system.  The default is to  write  RP02/RP03  BOOTS  on
RP02/RP03 packs and RP04 BOOTS on RP04 packs.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Select the appropriate .SAV file from the four which  are  distributed
(WTBOOT, WABOOT, WIBOOT, or WLBOOT) and install it on SYS.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

A feature test switch STDWTB (defaults off) has been added  to  WTBOOT
which  if  turned  off,  enables dialogue mode and allows WTBOOT to be
loaded with both an RP02/RP03 and an RP04 BOOTS.REL.

WTBOOT.DOC -- Changes from version 2(1) to 3(2)
January 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

WTBOOT version 3 now supports RP04's.  It will write an HRI  (hardware
read-in)  loader  on  block  0  of  an RP04 which will read BOOTS from
blocks 4-7 of the disk into the highest two pages of  the  processor's
physical memory.  (This is the same operation which TOPS10 performs on
a 407 restart.

Note that if the RH10 to which the RP04's are connected  is  connected
to  a  DF10C,  then  the mode select switch in the DF10C can be set to
either 18 bit mode (KA mode) or 22 bit mode (KI mode).  To  accomodate
both  cases,  version  3 of WTBOOT writes the read-in loader in 18-bit
format on even-numbered drives (0,2,4,6),  but  in  22-bit  format  on
odd-numbered  drives  (1,3,5,7).  Therefore, if the DF10C is set to KA
mode, the read-in unit switch in the RH10  should  point  at  an  even
numbered unit for HRI to succeed.  Similarly, if the DF10C is switched
to KI mode, an odd numbered unit should be  selected  by  the  read-in
unit switch in the RH10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

RP04's are now supported.  See warnings in the summary above.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION

Version 17 of BOOTS is required and the  paramater  FTFHD==0  must  be
defined   in  BOOTS  to  achieve  RP04  support.   See  BTS17.DOC  and
WTBOOT.CTL.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None beyond those required for RP04 support.

WTBOOT.RNO -- (Originally part of 5.03 release)
May 1971



WTBOOT writes BOOTS, a disk bootstrap  loader  program,  on  blocks  4
through 7 of all disk packs in the system.  The user runs WTBOOT once,
the first time a 5.03 monitor is built.  It is necessary to run WTBOOT
again  only  if  the  disks are reformatted.  BOOTS must be written on
blocks 4 through 7 of each disk  pack  in  order  for  the  new  crash
procedure  to  work.  Refer to the crash procedure instructions in the
CRASH.RNO file.

To run WTBOOT the user logs in to [1,2] and types

          .R WTBOOT

to which the system responds

          EXIT

when the procedure is completed.


NOTE:  WTBOOT writes BOOTS only on disk packs that are on-line, in the
user's  file structure, and not write-locked.  For more information on
BOOTS, or on loading BOOTS with a paper tape, refer  to  the  document
entitled BOOTS, in the PDP-10 Software Notebook.
