DAEMON.DOC - Changes from V14(513) to V15(574)
February 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON is intended to provide support  for  new  error
reporting  on  the  KL10  CPU.   In addition, it corrects some bugs in
version 14, and supports monitor changes for  6.03.   Replace  command
scanner and allow DAEMON to log pending entries from CRASH.EXE.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

At startup time now DAEMON searches system  structures  for  CRASH.EXE
and  processes  entries which were pending at crash time.  DAEMON then
flags the file as having been processed.  These entries are identified
in the SYSERR output as to origin.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Save files can only be written on a disk type device.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See DAEMON.CTL, DMN12.DOC and SYF3.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Command scanner has been replaced.

Edit #

514-517 Reserved for special releases.

520    Perform proper address checking for allocated but zero page.

521    Correct address check code to prevent possible  overwriting  of
       job data area.

522    Set up .JBINT to  prevent  hang  in  to  state  on  OPR  action
       requested conditions.

523    UUOSYMize DAEMON.

524    In case of STRUUO failure when resetting  DAEMON  search  list,
       purge invalid structures and retry STRUUO.
DMN15.DOC                                                       Page 5


525    Fix errors in WRTSWP (routine to write swapping space).

526    Fix improper ADDT at UADOLD-2 (from edit 521).

527    Ellimate millions of HRRI T1,.GTSTS 's.

530    Use XOR in place of ANDCA  to  see  if  a  block  crosses  page
       boundaries.

531    Fix potential loop in FINCHK by checking for proper segments.

532    Get rid of unneeded MOVSI T1,(J) 's.

533    Make DAEMON function to append to ERROR.SYS work.

534    Zero trailing space on ERROR.SYS on output.

535    Reassign channels to our job on release of channel.  Thus if we
       are  asked  to  log  an error for that file, the DDB will still
       exist.

536    Rip out scanner and replace with  reasonable  command  scanner.
       Make  minor  necessary  changes to the devil himself, including
       removal of edit 76.

537    Fix  up  interrupt  routine  so  it   won't   destroy   T1   or
       self-destruct.

540    Write DAEMON files on SYS once again.  Disenable new  to  avoid
       any  problems.   Hack out code which resets DAEMON search list,
       since this isn't necessary when writing on ERSATZ devices.

541    Fix improper index AC to  prevent  problems  when  reading  ARG
       block from user which is split across pages.

542    Make sure user has rename priv's when deleting .SAV, .HGH, etc.
       Also  fix  CHCACC  function  in  ACCCHK  to  check write priv's
       instead of rename priv's when trying to write.

543    Put patching space and junk under FTDEBG.

544    Set up INTADR so we can't leave user in DAEMON error  pause  if
       we blow up while recording error.

545    On disk error, don't give  expected  channel  termination  word
       unless  you have a 6.01 or greater monitor, since this value is
       not stored for the last error on  previous  monitors,  and  the
       best we can do is pick up the last expected channel termination
       word, which may be for a more recent  transfer  than  the  last
       error.

546    Add support for KL10 CPU error information obtained from  RSX20
       front-end -11.
DMN15.DOC                                                       Page 6


547    Change format of KL error entry in ERROR.SYS to  include  count
       of 8 bit data bytes.

550    Add definition of %CVPTR & .ESDRE until  UUOSYM  gets  updated.
       Also add support for LP100 code 71.

551    Add function to support reading pending entries and other  info
       from CRASH.EXE files.

552    Fixes to correctly record over 200 word error file entries.

553    Fix previous changes and make unused and illegal error codes go
       to JOBFIN via CPOPJ.

554    Fix edit 545 so that MONVER gets set up correctly.

555    Make work correctly for RP06's.

556    Fix KLERR stuff.

557    Put crash stuff in FTSAVE conditionals.

560    Fix edit 557.

561    Save PDBPTR around crash check stuff and fix typo's.

562    Get UDT from %CNDTM not %CNDAT.

563    Fix GTUPMP code.

564    Don't smash two rack structures with crash stuff.

565    Fix edit 544.

566    Fix magtape error reporting.

567    Fix REDSWP on VM.

570    Make DAEMON exit gracefully on re-enter.

571    DCORE spooled DDB's correctly.

572    Handle an argument block split across fragmented pages  on  the
       swapping space correctly on a VM system.

573    Fix magtape statistics reporting.   The  unit  name  was  being
       output as garbage.

reporting  on  the  KL10  CPU.   In addition, it corrects some bugs in
version 13.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

510      Fix bug in computing pointer to parity  subtable  in  code  3
         error file entry.

511      Don't report memory on-line at reload on 507/601 and  earlier
         monitors.

512      Allow error file entries to span more than one  block,  i.e.,

DAEMON.DOC - Changes from V12(341) to V13(474)
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON is intended to support the new error  reporting
added  in  the  6.02  monitor.   It  requires SYSERR Version 4.  Error
reporting has been extended to new devices and improved to  be  better
synchronized with the monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

442      Add code to user ERRPT.UUO instead of  scanning  for  errors.
         This  new  UUO  is  used to return an error along with enough
         information to enable DAEMON to identify specific errors, and
         not have to scan for them.

443      Fix HSVADR to not need UPMP in core.  Also fix calls  to  not
         read UPMP if not necessary for other reasons.

444      Fix DCORE to do correct thing with first page of high seg.

445      Change all super I/O to use SUSET.

446      Change references to symbols in  UPMP  to  use  GETTABS,  not
         defined symbols.

447      Fix setup of parameters for swapping to use GETTABS  and  win
         with units missing.

450      Fix code for handling error file to add word at start of each
         block  pointing  at first complete entry in block.  Also, pad
         last block with zeros.

451      Add support for code 50 in ERROR.SYS,  DL10  errors  602  and
         later monitors only.

452      Add function 5 to DAEMON UUO, append to ERROR.SYS.

453      Add support to OSAVE and OSSAVE commands for 6.02.

454      Add code to get job # from  DDB  on  both  6.02  and  earlier
         monitors.  Job -  was moved to new word in 6.02.

455      Add code to synchronize error reporting  with  stopped  jobs.
         No  jobs  will now be started at the job loop -- all will now
         be started after the error that stopped them is reported.
DMN13.DOC                                                      Page 10


456      Add code to support some new errors reported in 6.02.

         New errors are:  ER.CSC (Configuration Status Change) = 15
                          ER.MSE (Monitor Software Eror) = 2
                          ER.NXM     (Non-Ex-Mem,     never     before
         supported) = 4

457      Correct implementation of ER.MSE.

460      Fix bug in implementation of DL10 (ER.DLE) errors.

461      Fix TAPSER  error  reporting  to  user  TAPOP's  to  get  the
         pointers  to the initial and final error status areas, rather
         than absolute offsets relative to TUBRID.

462      Fix up massbuss errors to  report  user's  PPN  and  filename
         correctly.

463      Add users ID etc.  to code 3 & 10, add bad  blocks  slots  to
         code 10 & 11, add expected term.  wd to code 6.

464      Change error file header length to 4 and include SYS SER.   #
         and  change  header  Version to 1, increase MAX entry size to
         777 vice 77 by moving header length left 3 places.

465      Answer to SPR# 15908.

466      Modifications to correct for Version 1 headers in error file.

467      Add code to report NXM and set memory  offline  type  errors.
         This also changes the way reload error entry since it keeps a
         copy of the original NXM table in our code.

470      Fix code to use SUPER USETI./O if SUSET.  fails.

471      (16349)makes DCORE, DUMP, and SAVE abort on DSK errors.

472      Fix bugs in code 4(NXM), code 15(memory on/off line), and  in
         Edit 466.

473      Fix some uses of monitor version number to be uses of "VMMON"
         instead.

474      Fix byte pointer to store entry length in error  file  header
         to store 9 bits, not 6.  Part of Edit 466.
DMN13.DOC                                                      Page 11


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Save files can only be written on a disk type device.

NXM and memory on/offline error reporting will cause  SYSERR  problems
with the error file on systems with greater than 768K of core.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DAEMON.DOC - Changes from V11(224) to V12(341)
January 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON is intended primarily  to  speed  up  operation
with  6.01  and  to extend error reporting to support RP04's.  It also
fixes several bugs in the operation of  earlier  versions.   It  fully
replaces  all  earlier  versions.   See  especially  Edit  332  as  an
important bug fix.  Note that this version requires SYSERR V3B.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  Multiple Job Facility

DAEMON now can be run as one, two, or  three  jobs.   The  distributed
control  file  will,  as  before,  produce  3 save files:  restartable
DAEMON,  restartable  DAEMON+[SYSTEM]INFO,   and   [SYSTEM]INFO.    In
addition,  a  new feature test switch (FTSAVE) enables the assembly of
DAEMON into two parts, DAEMON and SAVER.

The functions of DAEMON are as follows:

          a)  Checkpointing
          b)  Error Reporting
          c)  Clock UUO's
          d)  Fact UUO's
          e)  [SYSTEM]INFO
          f)  DCORE UUO's
          g)  DCORE + DUMP commands
          h)  E, D, VERSION, and SAVE commands (6.01 only).

There are two feature  test  switches  involved  in  the  spliting  of
DAEMON's functions.  These are FTIPCF + FTSAVE.

The following table will indicate what  different  settings  of  these
feature test switches will produce.

                  FTIPCF=0         FTIPCF NOT EQUAL 0

     FTSAVE  0    f,g,h            Will not assemble 

     FTSAVE = 0   a,b,c,d,f,g,h    All

     FTSAVE > 0   a,b,c,d          a,b,c,d,e

In addition, it is possible to produce SYSINF.SAV as in the .CTL  file
to do function E separately.

The job produced with FTSAVE0,FTIPCF=0 is to be loaded  as  SAVER.SAV.
DMN12.DOC                                                      Page 14


It  will  run  only  along  with  a  DAEMON.SAV  with FTSAVE>0,FTIPCF=
anything.


2.2  Error Reporting Extension

With the addition of the RP04 disk the capability has  been  added  to
the  monitor  to  save  special  controller registers for a particular
unit.  This version of DAEMON includes  support  for  reporting  these
registers  on both the RP04 and the RS04.  Note that this will only be
done on monitors with the RP04 LIR or  on  6.02  and  later  monitors.
Note that this version in massbus error reporting attempts to make use
of parameters in the DDB.  See section 3.0 for a  problem  with  this.
This facility requires SYSERR V3B.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Massbus device  errors  will  not  correctly  report  the  file  name,
extension, user's ppn or program.

When run as a 2 part job (DAEMON/SAVER)  DAEMON  UUO's  may  not  work
correctly.

Any deficiencies in the DMN11.DOC file not explicitly listed as  fixed
in section 5 of this file are still deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See DAEMON.CTL, DMN11.DOC and SYF2.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

325      Add a feature test to create the ability to assemble  as  two
         separate  programs,  one  to  do  all  commands and the DCORE
         function  of  the  uuo,  and  one  to  do  error   reporting,
         checkpointing,   accounting,   other   UUO   functions,   and
         [SYSTEM]INFO.  The feature test is FTSAVE, equal -1 for SAVER
         only,  0  for  both,  and  +1  for  DAEMON  only.   note that
         FTIPCF=-1 or FTRSTR=-1 will not work with FTSAVE=-1.

326      Add support for  RH10  devices.This  implements  the  special
         drive  registers  on  massbus  devices.   This  edit  is only
         intended for RP04's and RS04's on systems with the RP04  lir.
         It will have no effect on systems without the RP04 lir.

327      Fix some inconsistencies in behavior on SAVE.
DMN12.DOC                                                      Page 15


330      Save address of DDB along with length so user  can  associate
         DDBs with channels (SPR 14451).

331      Finish EDIT 325 -- make typeout say the right things.

332      Fix bug in FINCHK which caused job 8 (ac J =8 ) to be checked
         rather  than  the job we were interested in.  This bug caused
         random error code 3 to DAEMON UUOs and also writing in random
         pages.

333      Fix DAEMON to take advantage of the GETTAB's added in 507/601
         for its benefit.

334      Add code to dump UNILOG as last item  in  code  10  entry  in
         ERROR file.

335      Make unknown commands give error message,  instead  of  doing
         DCORE as in previous versions.

336      Fix swapping pointers for 507.  They are the same on both 507
         and 601, not different as previously coded.  See edit 211 for
         similar change for 601.

337      Fix bugs added by change to DAEMON/SAVER (Edit 325),  and  in
         using new GETTABS (Edit 333).

340      Fix race added by Edit 325.

341      Speed up COMPRS (ignore  nonexistent  pages,  don't  look  at
         every word on them).

DAEMON.DOC - Changes from V10(110) to V11(224)
October 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON contains those changes needed  to  support  the
6.01  monitor.   No earlier version will run correctly with 6.01.  See
SYF2.DOC for information on the latest version of SYSTEM[INFO].



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

No significant external changes  exist.   However,  this  version  has
extensive  changes  to  make  all  normal save files look exactly like
those saved by the monitor.  There is also one change in the  handling
of ERROR.X??  files.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

It is not possible to write .SAV files on any device but a  disk.   If
you  type Control-C during a save command, a partial file will be left
in you disk area.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The control file DAEMON.CTL will generate 3 save files:

     1.  DAEMON.SAV a  version  of  DAEMON,  which  does  not  contain
         [SYSTEM]INFO and is restartable.

     2.  DAEINF.SAV a version of DAEMON, which  contains  [SYSTEM]INFO
         and is restartable.

     3.  SYSINF.SAV a stand alone version of [SYSTEM]INFO.

This set allows a fall back  when  a  malfunctioning  of  one  of  the
components is suspected.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

211      Fix code to handle new swapping pointers for 6.01 correctly.

212      Remove CRLF from JOB SAVED message to look like monitor.

213      Fix EXAMINE and DEPOSIT commands for high segments.

214      Check for output device of NUL and finish with no IO if true.

215      Fix high segment save to only write exact number of words  in
         last block of .HGH or .SHR file.

216      Fix to EDIT 62 to make DAEMON write in last  ERROR.X??   file
         which exists on ERRDEV.

217      Fix undefined globals ILIST and OLIST if CHKFCT=0.

220      Fix to make DAEMON save  do  same  as  monitor  dependent  on
         contents of .JBCOR and .JBHRL.

221      Fix to not error intercept on all IO.BKT  errors  so  we  can
         report them on commands.

222      Fix 220 and 215 to do the right thing together.

223      Add external symbols so SYSINF knows start and end of DAEMON.

224      Fix to 220/222 to not save .LOW if .JBCOR140.

DAEMON.DOC - Changes from V7(72) to V10(110)
June 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON contains the first release of the  [SYSTEM]INFO
support  program.   This program is part of DAEMON.  However it can be
run seperately if so desired (see Section 2).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

In addition to incorporation of [SYSTEM]INFO, some  of  these  changes
have been made.

     1.  The format of .SAVE files created by  DAEMON  is  changed  so
         that  non-contiguous low segments can be "GOTTEN" into a core
         image  that  resembles  the  original.   This  is   done   by
         outputting a null IOWD for each existant but zero page in the
         core image.

     2.  A bug which sometimes caused DAEMON to bang in TI  wait  mode
         has been fixed.

     3.  Fixed a bug which  caused  DAEMON  to  attempt  to  read  the
         swapping space using an erroneous swapping pointer.

     4.  Fix a problem reading a "job" UPMP from the swapping space.

     5.  Fixed a security leak while doing DCORE's.

     6.  Init DSK:[1,4] instead of SYS:[1,4] for the updating  of  the
         ERROR.SYS and FACT.SYS file.

     7.  If another DAEMON is running  then  exit  without  detaching,
         after issuing a warning.

     8.  When DAEMON is stopped change its name to  DAE  before  doing
         the EXIT UUO, as elsewise terminal will be detached.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

This version has no known problems.

Note:  That the PSISER and IPCSER facility are required.

NOTE:  NEVER ASSEMBLE ANY [SYSTEM]INFO COMPONENT WITH FTDEBUG ON.
NOTE:  NO DATE 75 DEPENDENCY.
DMN10.DOC                                                      Page 19


4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

4.1  [SYSTEM]INFO Installation

The control file SYSINF.CTL will generate 3 save files:

     1.  DAEMON.SAV a  version  of  DAEMON,  which  does  not  contain
         [SYSTEM]INFO and is restartable.

     2.  DAEINF.SAV a version of DAEMON, which  contains  [SYSTEM]INFO
         and is restartable.

     3.  SYSINF.SAV a stand alone version of [SYSTEM]INFO.

This set allows a fall back  when  a  malfunctioning  of  one  of  the
components is suspected.

All these programs can be stopped by means of a reenter command.  Note
that  this  is  very  important for the [SYSTEM]INFO facility as it is
impossible to restart another version before the old [SYSTEM]INFO  has
released  its claim to this role.  (as longe as the variable %CNIPI in
the monitor is non zero no other [SYSTEM]INFO can be started.

Note:  That DAEINF.SAV needs to be renamed to DAEMON.SAV  when  it  is
run as DAEMON.


4.2  Automatic Restarts

Whenever errors make it impossible to  continue  the  running  of  the
program  a  rerun  of the program at an offset of 2 will be done.  The
restarted program will check the uptime of the previous  run  whenever
this  time  is less then 10 minutes on the same day, it will advice to
run another version (which is not required) and exit.


4.3  Special Instructions

In order to stop orderly DAEMON do the following:

     1. Attach to the job.
     2. Type halt.
     3. Reenter.

For SYSINF.SAV only step 3 has to be done.  In  case  that  the  above
procedure was not followed for either:  SYSINF or DAEINF kill the job.
This will relinquish the [SYSTEM]INFO facility.


4.4  Building Instructions

See the supplied control file.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.

DAEMON.DOC -- Changes from V6 to V7
December 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of DAEMON V7(52), includes code to support monitor  error
logging  in  5.06  and  later  monitors.  It also includes several bug
fixes, a partial cleanup of symbol usage,  conditionalization  of  the
.FACT  and  .CLOCK  functions,  support  for path specification in the
.DCORE function and default path in the DUMP and DCORE  commands,  and
recognizes  that  a  job  is being swapped when reading or writing its
core, waiting for it to be finished before looking at it.


DAEMON runs on all supported monitors (except  1040).   There  are  no
known  bugs,  and  the  only  known  deficiency  is that explicit path
specification is not accepted on DUMP and DCORE commands.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

DAEMON will now recognize that a job  is  stopped  for  error  logging
(JS.DEP set in Job's JBTSTS word), and restart the job after making an
appropriate entry in ERROR.SYS, the error log file.

DAEMON creates a file called SYS:ERROR.SYS, which contains information
pertaining  to hardware errors encountered during the operation of the
system.  This information is intended to facilitate field service,  by
giving  reports  of soft errors, and pinpointing intermittent problems
when they occur.

The DUMP and DCORE commands will  now  write  in  the  user's  default
directory  rather  than  his  UFD unless an explicit PPN is specified.
The .DCORE function of the DAEMON UUO accepts  a  pointer  to  a  path
specification  instead  of a PPN in the directory word of the argument
list if one is given.  DAEMON error code 10  (E.DPTH)  is  defined  to
mean a path specification was too long.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

DAEMON still uses SCANER, rather than SCAN, and so does not  recognize
explicit  path  specification  in  commands.   This should be fixed in
version 10.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

New assembly parameters are defined in 5.1.
DMN7.DOC                                                       Page 22


5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

5.1  Default parameter settings are moved to page  1.   The  following
new parameters have been added:

FTERR     -  Enables  logging  of  hardware  error   and   performance
            information into the file ERROR.SYS.  (SPR 6396)

FTCLCK    - Enables the .CLOCK function of the DAEMON UUO.  (SPR 7016)

FTUSCN    - Enables periodic (hourly) collection of  unit  performance
            statistics in ERROR.SYS.

CPUN      - No.  of cpu's on which to keep error counts.

CHNN      -No.  of DF10 channels on which to keep error counts.

UNITN     - No.  of disks on which to keep error counts.

ERRDEV    - SIXBIT device name on which to write ERROR.SYS.

ERRPPN    - UFD into which to write ERROR.SYS.

ERRSIZ    - Maximum size of entries in ERROR.SYS.

FTFACT    - Enables the .FACT function  of  the  DAEMON  UUO.   (SPR's
            7016, 6266)

FTCHKPNT  - Enables taking of checkpoints every  10  minutes.   (SPR's
            7016, 6266)

FCTDEV    - SIXBIT device name on which to write FACT.SYS.

FCTPPN    - UFD into which to write FACT.SYS.

TRNSIZ    - Maximum size of any single FACT.SYS entry.

DPTHLN    - Maximum length of a path specification.

MAXAGE    - Maximum time (in  seconds)  any  FACT.SYS  entry  will  be
            permitted  to  stay in the buffer before DAEMON will force
            writing it.  Zero is equivalent to infinity.

CHKTIM    - Time between checkpoints for the FACT file.

USCTIM    - Time between unit scans to collect performance statistics.


5.2  Changed GETTAB table numbers to .GTxxx format symbols.
DMN7.DOC                                                       Page 23


5.3  Defined bits in various UUO's, etc.


5.4  Defined channel and unit  data  block  items  for  use  by  error
logging.


5.5  Defined entry identification codes for ERROR.SYS.


5.6  Removed arbitrary request for 1K core  at  beginning  of  DAEMON,
allocated core as needed.  (SPR's 6513, 6863)


5.7  Inserted leading character "%" in warning messages.


5.8  Re-wrote search list handling so DAEMON would not keep any STR in
its passive search list after finishing DUMP or DCORE.


5.9  Added check to prevent running more than one DAEMON.


5.10 Replaced use of JIFSEC symbol (jiffies  per  second)  with  value
obtained from CNFTBL in monitor.


5.11 Removed unnecessary core allocation for clock tables.


5.12 Added code to put system-reload  information  into  FACT.SYS  and
ERROR.SYS.


5.13 Added  code  to  scan  error  counters  in  monitor  and   output
appropriate information to ERROR.SYS whenever any counter changed.


5.14 Added code to force output of FACT.SYS buffer if  less  than  one
minute  to  KSYS  time,  or  if  any entry in fact buffer more than 10
minutes old (variable = MAXAGE).


5.15 Commented the calling sequence for DAEMON UUO functions.


5.16 Added code to recognize and  accept  path  definition  in  .DCORE
function, and to default DUMP and DCORE output to user's default path.
DMN7.DOC                                                       Page 24


5.17 Added defensive check routine ATTCHK and  calls  to  verify  that
DAEMON is attached before attempting any TTY I/O.  (SPR 7239)


5.18 Fixed bugs in handling of DUMP switches.


5.19 Used DEVCHR DV.DSK bit  to  recognize  disk  DDB's,  rather  than
depending on DEVNAM containing 'DSK'.


5.20 Added debug counters for "should never happen" situations.


5.21 Added FINCHK subroutine and calls in WTUCOR and  GTUCOR  routines
to  compare  the absolute value of %SWFIN against the job number being
read or written, and sleep until they are  not  equal.   This  change,
together  with  MCO  3078,  fixes  a  problem which often showed up as
duplicate entries in the FACT file.  The problem was caused by  JOBPEK
thinking  it  could  succeed,  when  the target job was being swapped.
JOBPEK and DAEMON now  both  check  FINISH  (GETTAB  name  %SWFIN)  to
prevent access attempts during swapping of the target job.


5.22 Revised GTUCOR routine (which reads another job's core  area)  to
clear  unused  portion of its buffer, so un-specified arguments are 0.
(SPR 6862)


5.23 Re-wrote address checking routine to handle argument list in AC's
or high segment correctly.


5.24 Added code under FTUSCN for hourly scan of disk unit data  blocks
to output performance data to ERROR.SYS.


5.25 Revised fact file APPEND routine to do extended LOOKUP and  ENTER
to prevent trouble when FACT.SYS exceeds 1024 blocks.


5.26 Removed all references  to  spy  segment  except  in  PEKSPY  and
GTBSPY.   This makes it possible for DAEMON to run with monitors which
do not have the SPY UUO.


5.27 Added validity checks on .FACT function of DAEMON UUO  to  verify
that  3  of the 4 fields of the header word (type id, job  , and entry
length) are non-zero, and that entry length  corresponds  to  argument
list length -1.  Error code 7 (e.dffb) returned if any check fails.
DMN7.DOC                                                       Page 25


5.28 Added defensive code at UUEXIT to prevent loop and  PDL  overflow
when  an error is detected reading or writing the swapping space.  The
old code attempted to write an error indication in  the  job  in  this
case,  potentially  provoking  a repeat of the same error.  The change
gives up if an error occurs while trying to write the completion code.


5.29 Modified swapping space I/O routines to recognize 5.06 and  later
monitors  running on a KI10 processor, and index the swapping space by
pages rather than K's.
