APLSF.DOC  -- Changes from V1C(315) to V2(435)
September 1979






1.0  SUMMARY

APLSF is the implementation on the DECSYSTEM-20 of  the  APL  language
with shared system functions and system variables.  It runs on a KL-20
processor under release 3A  or  later  of  the  TOPS-20  monitor.   It
requires  the  compatibility package, PA1050, during execution, and is
documented   in    the    APLSF    Programmer's    Reference    Manual
(DEC-20-LASFA-A-D).   Version  2 is documented in the TOPS-10/20 APLSF
Language Manual (AA-H200A-TK).

Version 2 runs under release 3A or later of the TOPS-20  monitor.   It
has been tested in-house under 3A and 4.

The reason for this release is to correct outstanding  bugs  in  APLSF
Version  1C  and  to  incorporate  several  functional enhancements as
described below.

APLSF Version 2 fully supersedes Version 1C and includes edits #316 to
#435.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


     1.  The current setting of )MAXCOR is now saved across  a  )CALL,
         so  it is possible to return from a )CALL even if )MAXCOR had
         been expanded in the workspace before the )CALL.

     2.  There are now TTY mnemonics for diamond (.DM),  left  bracket
         (.LB),  left  tack (.LK), right bracket (.RB), and right tack
         (.RK).

     3.  Nonprinting elements of the atomic  vector  (.BXAV)  are  now
         displayed  as  squish  quad  (.SQ).   Note that this is not a
         valid character and cannot be typed to APL.

     4.  When doing APL output to an ASCII sequential  file  while  in
         TTY  mode,  the  default terminal type is now LA36 instead of
         2741 (which is not supported by TOPS-20).

     5.  Error numbers  are  now  catenated  to  the  front  of  error
         messages.   Also, the error line printed when an error occurs
         occasionally has fewer added spaces and the caret position is
         sometimes one position to the right of where it used to be.

     6.  LIB:  now refers to whatever the user has logical  name  LIB:
         defined  to  be,  instead  of  the APL system library.  LIBn:
         still refers to the system library.

     7.  It is now possible to open a PTY as an ASCII sequential file.
         As noted in the next item, lower case input will be converted
         to upper case just as with any ASCII  sequential  file.   The
         new  system  variable .BXTIMEOUT will be set if the input was
         not terminated with a line feed.

     8.  When doing TTY mode input from ASCII sequential files,  lower
         case characters are converted to uppercase (instead of random
         operators).

     9.  The omega function (.OM) has been removed from the version  2
         manual.   Omega  still  works  in  version  2 but will not be
         supported after version 2.  The .OM symbol has other proposed
         uses  in  the  APL  language and the optimizing effect of .OM
         will be implememted for reduce-iota-rho.

    10.  The definitions of  I-beams  (.IB)  have  been  moved  to  an
         appendix  of  the version 2 manual.  They are still supported
         in version 2 and  most  will  still  be  supported  in  later
         versions  for  compatibility with other vendors.  However, we
         strongly recommend that system  variables  and  functions  be
         used instead of I-beams.

    11.  Quote-quad (.QQ) or quad-del (.QD) input following .QQ or .QD
         output  precedes  the  input  string  with a string of blanks
         equal in length to the preceding output.  If  such  preceding
         output  was  longer  than  390  characters (the maximum input
APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 4


         length), a LINE TOO LONG error occurs and  correct  input  is
         awaited.

    12.  For  niladic  function  F  which  returns   no   value,   the
         expressions  "1;F", "1+F" and "F+1" give value errors since a
         value is needed by the  primitive  function  but  F  did  not
         return  one.  The expression "F;1" returns 1 to be consistent
         with the expression "F", which executes F but prints nothing.
         Note  that  the  ";"  function is a monadic output catenator,
         operating on  the  expression  to  its  right.   ";"  is  not
         intended to be a statement separator.

    13.  On the -20, GENSF can now set the device for the library area
         and  the  )HI  file as well as the directory.  The default is
         now PS:  instead of DSK:  so APLSF will be able to find these
         areas  even  if  you  are  not connected to PS:.  You must be
         connected to  the  device  specified  for  these  areas  when
         running  GENSF  in  order  for the generation procedure to be
         successful.  Notice that this device is  also  used  for  the
         billing file.




2.1  Functional Changes


     1.  .BXMTP has been modified to simulate some of the  TAPOPs  not
         in  PA1050.   It  still has problems if the file has not been
         opened.  Specifically, density and mode cannot  be  set  from
         inside  APL before the file is opened.  Use the SET TAPE Exec
         command to set these tape parameters.




2.2  Functional Additions

2.2.1  Error Trapping - The following system variables  and  functions
have  been  added  to  allow  program handling of error conditions and
other events.

     1.  .BXBREAK - This is a monadic function which causes  execution
         to  terminate,  suspending  the current function and entering
         immediate mode.  It prints its argument  before  breaking  to
         the terminal.

     2.  .BXERROR - This is a variable which is  set  by  APL  to  the
         error  message  for  the  last  error.  (It contains the text
         which is normally printed on the terminal.)

     3.  .BXSIGNAL - This is a dyadic function which signals an  error
         from the current function.  It causes the current function to
         terminate before generating the error.  Its right argument is
         either a valid APL error or a user defined error in the range
APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 5


         500-999.  Its optional left argument is  the  message  to  be
         associated with the error.

     4.  .BXTRAP - This variable is similar to .BXLX.  It can  be  set
         to an expression which will be executed when an error occurs.




2.2.2  Limiting Input Wait - The  following  two  variables  allow   a
program  to  limit  the  amount  of time a user is given to respond to
quote-quad or quad-del input.

     1.  .BXTIMELIMIT - The number of milliseconds to  wait  for  user
         input.  If 0, then no limit.  If -1, no waiting is done (only
         characters which were typed ahead are read).

     2.  .BXTIMEOUT - Flag indicating whether or not user timed out on
         last  input.   (This  flag is also used with PTYs to indicate
         whether or not last input was terminated with a LF).




2.2.3  New Character Arrays - The  following  system   variables   are
useful subsets of .BXAV.

     1.  .BXALPHA - The 27 letters, .LD-Z.

     2.  .BXALPHAU - The 27 underscored letters, .Z@-.ZZ.

     3.  .BXASCII - The 128 ASCII codes.   These  codes  are  sent  to
         files  as  is,  regardless  of  the  terminal type.  They are
         useful when doing graphics.

     4.  .BXCTRL - The 32 control characters, octal 0-37.

     5.  .BXNUM - The 10 digits, 0-9.




2.2.4  New File Functions -

     1.  .BXRENAME - This is a dyadic system function which  allows  a
         user to rename a file from within APL.  Its right argument is
         the channel associated with the file to be renamed.  Its left
         argument is the new filespec.

     2.  .BXAPPEND - This is a dyadic system function which  allows  a
         user  to  append data to /BU or /DA files.  Its left argument
         is the data item to be  appended  to  the  file.   Its  right
         argument  has  the  same  format  as the right argument to an
         output quad (.OQ)  and  specifies  how  the  data  is  to  be
         formatted in the file.
APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 6


     3.  Two new file types, /AS* and /BS*, have been added  to  allow
         users  to append to ASCII and binary sequential files.  These
         file types are analogous to /IS*.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

3.1  Deficiencies And Restrictions

The known deficiencies and restrictions in APLSF are:

     1.  The  caret  symbol  indicating  where  an  error  in  an  APL
         statement  was  first  detected is sometimes displayed in the
         wrong position.  With the introduction of error trapping  and
         .BXERROR, it is desirable to fix this.  We will attempt to do
         so in the future.  With this in mind, we recommend that users
         do not write programs which depend on the current positioning
         of the caret.

     2.  It is not possible to display the trace or stop vector  of  a
         function.  This is a restriction which will not be removed in
         the foreseeable future.

     3.  It is impossible to  enter  an  invalid  TTY  mnemonic  in  a
         character  string  when  using  a TTY terminal, just as it is
         impossible  to  enter  an  illegal  overstrike  from  an  APL
         terminal.  This is a permanent restriction.

     4.  Monadic domino uses an inordinate amount of core.  This is  a
         deficiency  due  to  the  algorithm  used, which does monadic
         domino by simulating a dyadic domino with a left argument  of
         the  identity  matrix.   Thus,  it  must  construct  a double
         precision identity matrix.




3.2  Outstanding Bugs

The known outstanding bugs in APLSF are:


     1.  Erasing a pendent or a suspended function can cause a  SYSTEM
         ERROR, depending on the state of the function when erased.

     2.  The compression of a zero-by-n matrix returns a length  error
         when  the  left argument is an n-element vector, but works if
         it is a scalar.

     3.  A niladic branch inside a multistatement line will fail  with
         a SYNTAX ERROR.

     4.  Linefeeds  typed  during  linefeed  editing  may  appear   as
         carriage   return   linefeed  pairs.   This  is  a  temporary
         restriction which will be  corrected  in  version  4  of  the
         compatibility  package.   A patch to PA1050 which solves this
         problem  is  included  in  the  beware  file  on  this   tape
         (APLSF.BWR).
APLSF.DOC                                                       Page 8


     5.  The )LIB command updates  the  access  dates  of  the  listed
         files.  In particular, )LIB/A updates the access dates to the
         current date before printing them.  This is  a  problem  with
         the compatibility package.

APLSF.DOC                                                      Page 10


APLSF.

     APLHSF.APL   The APLSF HI file, if a HI message is desired.

     ACCTSF.APL   The APLSF accounting file.

The default is to put all files on the subsystem area PS:<SUBSYS>, and
to  make the APL library area be PS:<SUBSYS>.  There is no need to put
the files from the REL LIBRARIES saveset on disk.



4.2  Changing the Default Installation Parameters

The default installation parameters are as follows:

     The installation name is DECSYSTEM-20 APLSF.
     The automatic save facility, .BXAUS, is off.
     The structure used for the HI file and the library is PS:.
     The name of the accounting file is ACCTSF.APL.
     The directory used for the accounting file is <SUBSYS>.
     The directory used for the HI file and the library is <SUBSYS>.
     The default value  of  )MAXCOR  (and  thus  the  default  maximum
          workspace size) is 40P.

If a change in the parameters is desired, put the .EXE file on  device
DSK:, run GENSF.EXE and answer the questions.  The program updates the
.EXE file.  Then rename and distribute  the  different  files  to  the
appropriate disk structures and directories.



4.3  Creating a HI Message

If you wish a HI message, login as the operator, sign  on  APLSF,  and
execute the command

     )HI 'THIS IS MY HI MESSAGE'

Then sign off APLSF.  This generates APLHSF.APL on the  structure  and
the directory specified for the )HI file by GENSF.

The )HI message is truncated to 239 characters.  The error message "WS
NOT  FOUND"  means that the )HI file directory specified by GENSF does
not exist.

373       -----     Allow .BXSIGNAL and .BXBREAK in immediate mode.

374       -----     Introduce the idea of system variables  which  can
                    be  set by the system but not the user (needed for

                    with  errors  which  occur  in  the  .BXTRAP  line
                    itself, not in any functions which are called.

402       -----     Remove 1030, ONTEL and TYCOM terminal  types  from
                    HELP  message.   They are still supported, but are

404       -----     Take CRLF out from before ATTENTION SIGNALED error
                    message  so  error number appears on the same line
                    as message.

415       QA3420    Fix edit 367 to contract core on  )LOAD:   problem
                    only  occurs  on  the  -10 when loading smaller WS

                    following .QQ or .QD output.

417       QAR560    Prevent  INCHAR  from  discarding  any   character
                    except a linefeed following a carriage-return.

420       -----     When the  quad-error  data  entry  gets  allocated
                    after  a  partially-built data entry that gtcore()
                    was trying to get core for when a wsfull  occured,
                    move the quad-error data entry above the partially
                    built data entry and update globals  as  necessary
                    prevent the workspace from being trashed.

421       Q00546    Correct function-line wraparound during output  of
                    a  numeric vector (broken during implementation of
                    .BXERROR).

422       -----     Prevent system errors  during  evaluation  of  the

                    below 770.

430       QAR612    Change the wording in GENSF (XLIMCOR) to  ask  for

431       QAR613    Allow -20 to specify LIBn:  structure (default  is
                    PS:).

432       -----     Fix the dqren() interface to cmdsyn()  to  prevent
                    wsid-filename default, accidentally deleted files,
                    lost default file extension, and infinite loops.

433       QAR564    INLINE loops when .bxTIMEOUT = 1  on  PTY  because
                    FILINP didn't reset TIMOUT (DEVTYP UUO is CALLI 53
                    octal not decimal).

434       -----     Create PATCH.REL to define PATCH:  area to be used
                    instead of PAT..  (which could get wiped out by an
                    exapanding WS).

435       QA3587    Fix typos in FS on -10 in /BS*.  Make STRTIO leave
                    BLKNUM  and  INDEX = 0 so WRTSETUP will do read of
                    last block which write goes into on append.

6.0  SUGGESTIONS

6.1  Continuing a detached APL job

In the event of a line drop or system crash, a user's job  may  become
detached.  After reestablishing a connection with the system, the user
should check to see if his/her job is still there.  If  so,  the  user
should reattach to the job using the ATTACH command.  Then, to restore
the job to its previous state, the user should type CONTINUE.  If  the
user  instead types APLSF, a new version of APL will be loaded and the
job's previous core image will be destroyed,  along  with  the  user's
workspace.
