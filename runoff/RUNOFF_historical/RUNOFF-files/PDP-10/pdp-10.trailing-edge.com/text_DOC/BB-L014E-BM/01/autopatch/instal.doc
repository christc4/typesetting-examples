           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.1
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-20  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.1.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-20  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 1.2 of ALGOL-20

            Version 2 of the APL products:
        
                APL-20
                APLSF-20

            Version 2.1 of BASIC-PLUS-2

            Version 12B of COBOL-68/74

            Version 6 of DBMS-20

            Version 6 of FORTRAN-20

            Version 4C of SORT-20

     Autopatch  V1.1  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.
                                                                  Page 2


     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  AP20:,  we
     recommend  that  you  make  an  entry in the LOGIN.CMD file and the
     BATCH.CMD file that DEFINEs AP20:  to be the structure you will  be
     using.   If  you  do  this,  you  will  not need to edit the Dumper
     Control Files used to set up the product  distribution  directories
     or  to retrieve patches.  The LOGIN.CMD and BATCH.CMD files must be
     on the PS:  structure for the account you will be logging  into  to
     SUBMIT  these  batch  control  files.   We  recommend  that you use
     <AUTOPATCH> as this directory name.

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  DUMPER  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in PS:<SUBSYS>  or  one  of
     the directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE
                UPDATE.EXE

     The following file should be installed in PS:<HELP> or one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following file should be installed in the  disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP201.PDF

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also  contains  batch  control  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These "Distribution DUMPER Control" files are intended to run under
     batch.   They  issue  a  MOUNT request for the product distribution
     tape and then run DUMPER to restore the required  files.   See  the
     last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-20-V2  product  you
     would install

                APL2S2.CTL      for APLSF-20 rebuild
                APL2S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                                                                  Page 3


                APL2S2.DDC      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.

     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  you  system  as  described  in  the  installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-20-V1-2  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-20
     distribution  tape BB-5471C-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the ALGOL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save set "SOURCE files for ALGOL"
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the ALGOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
                                                                  Page 5

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build  process for ALGOL redfines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.



     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Both APL-20 and APLSF-20 are  autopatchable  with  Autopatch-10/20.
     Before  preparing  these  products for autopatching, they should be
     installed  on  your  system  as  described  in   the   installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.
                                                                  Page 6

        From save set "COBOL-74-Build"

        COBASM.MAC      for Cobol-74

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the COBOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.COBOL>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.COBOL>
     as the distribution directory.  This control file also restores the
     files for Autopatching the SORT-20-V4C product.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL12B-68.DDC for Cobol-68

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>CBL12B-74.DDC for Cobol-74
        

     If you will be Autopatching BOTH  Cobol-68  and  Cobol-74  two  new
     files   are   required  in  the  patching  directory.   Obtain  the
     COBASM.MAC file for Cobol-68 and  make  a  copy  named  C68ASM.MAC.
     Likewise,  obtain  a  copy  of the COBASM.MAC file for Cobol-74 and
     make a copy named C74ASM.MAC.

     If you will be Autopatching the 68274  translation  tool  you  must
     create a copy of the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set on
                                                                 Page 11


     and call it TRNASM.MAC.  For more information refer to section  6.0
     of the COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12B distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     If you are NOT autopatching the DBMS-20 V6  product  the  selection
     process for COBOL V12B will report checksum mismatches for the DBMS
     components of the COBOL compiler.  These messages can be ignored.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for  more  information.   The  Autopatch  build  process  for COBOL
     redfines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified  when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  you  system  as  described  in  the  installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-20  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
               +DBMSF.EXE
               +FORDML.EXE
               +FORLIB.REL      (not supplied on DBMS distribution)

        + only if using DBMS with FORTRAN


     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  DBMS-20
     distribution  tape BB-4148E-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the DBMS-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save set "DBMS Source files"
        
                DBMEN2.REL

                SCHIO2.REL
                STRHI.REL

     If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will  need  to  copy
     the  following files from the DBMS-20 distribution tape BB-4148E-BM
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   COBOL-20
     distribution directory.

                STRDCL.MAC
                STRUNV.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DBMS-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.   In  the  DDC
     file  which  also prepares the COBOL-20 directory CDIS:  is defined
     to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.COBOL>.  If you  wish  to  use  this  control
     file,  but  are  not  using  an  AP20:  structure, you will want to
     include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD  file  on  the
     PS:   structure  for  the  LOGIN account from which you will SUBMIT
     this control file.  However, you will have  to  edit  this  control
     file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> or <AUTOPATCH.COBOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB20V6.DDC
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>DB20V6-CBL.DDC
                for DBMS-20 with COBOL-20
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.  The

     If you use DBMS with FORTRAN and want to have the  Autopatch  Patch
     and  Build  Control  file build DBMS into FORTRAN you must create a
     dummy file in the patching directory (PAT:) called FTNDBM.FLG.  The
     presence of this file on PAT:  will cause the BATCH control file to
     branch in order to perform the processing required  to  incorporate
     DBMS  into FORTRAN.  NOTE that this procedure assumes that DBMS has
     been autopatched first.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper

     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  you  system  as  described  in  the  installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  SORT-20  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SORT.EXE
                SRTCBL.REL

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  SORT-20
     distribution  tape  BB-4160F-BM  or  from the COBOL-20 distribution
     tape BB-H506C-BM into the disk directory you have  set  up  as  the
     SORT-20 distribution directory.

                SRTUUO.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the SORT-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.SORT>.  If you wish to
     use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in  the  BATCH.CMD
     file  on  the  PS:   structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control  file  if  you  choose  not  to use <AUTOPATCH.SORT> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH>SRT24C.DDC
