PRODUCTS INVOLVED


1.0  PRODUCTS INVOLVED

This .DOC file covers the following two products.   The  version
numbers listed below are the version numbers of this release.

      -  TOPS-10 2780/3780 ET v4.0

      -  TOPS-10 2780/3780/HASP v1.0




2.0  SUMMARY


These are sold as two separate products.  Since  many  of  their
components  are  identical,  this  .DOC  file will refer to both
products as "the product" except where otherwise indicated.

This is a new development release and  requires  GALAXY  version
4.1 to run.

The  2780/3780  mode  of  the  KL  product  supports  up  to   6
synchronous  lines.  When using the HASP mode of the KL product,
a maximum of 4 lines is supported, of which only 2 can  use  the
HASP protocol.





3.0  NEW FUNCTIONS/FEATURES



     1.  The new IBMCOM is integrated into GALAXY 4.1.

     2.  Descriptive error messages have been included  in  this
         product.    Error  messages  are  communicated  to  the
         operator through OPR.  The messages themselves may come
         from  one  of  a number of components of or relating to
         the  IBMcomm  product.   That  is,  the  messages   may
         originate  in  the  IBMcomm  software  itself or in the
         TOPS-10  GALAXY  system.   The  documentation  on  such
         messages  is  very  informative.  It includes a further
         interpretation of the message, as well  as  the  proper
         steps to take to recover from the error.

     3.  The new IBMSPL writes Usage Accounting records.

     4.  The new product uses the PROTOTYPE node  functionality.
         The  PROTOTYPE  node  is  used  in  termination mode to
         DEFINE, SET, and START  a  port/line  combination  over
         which  any  number of remote stations with the same SET
IBMCOM.DOC -- Changes in this release                     Page 3
NEW FUNCTIONS/FEATURES


         features may communicate.  Only  one  of  these  remote
         stations  may  communicate over the PROTOTYPE port/line
         combination at any  one  time.   The  benefit  of  this
         feature  is  that  for  remote  stations  with  similar
         characteristics, the operator does not have  to  DEFINE
         and  START  multiple  termination  nodes.   In fact, no
         TOPS-10 operator intervention is needed  to  start  any
         physical   termination  node,  once  the  corresponding
         PROTOTYPE node has been STARTed.  The way in which  the
         actual  termination  nodes are recognized by the -10 is
         through the presence  of  their  nodenames  and  signon
         information  within  the  PROTOTYPE node's signon file.
         Status  and  parameter  perusal   within   OPR   yields
         information  on  both the PROTOTYPE node and the actual
         node(s).  Only actual nodes can have a card reader  and
         line  printer.  When using the SHUTDOWN command to OPR,
         it  is  wise  to  remember  that  one  can  shut   down
         scheduling  for  an actual termination node, or one can
         shut down a line by issuing the  SHUTDOWN  command  for
         the PROTOTYPE node.

     5.  Each available IBMcomm  product  includes  a  debugging
         front  end  that  can  be  loaded to allow easier error
         analysis.
