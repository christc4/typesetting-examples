                          statpack



purpose

     the statpack was written to enable a large section of the western
michigan  university  community  to  do  much of their own statistical
analysis on a terminal with only a simple  working  knowledge  of  the
decsystem-10.



limitations

     maximum core allowable
          nv - number of variables
          no - number of observations     no*nv+nv*nv+2*max+3*nv<8001
          max - larger of nv or no

     see also table of variable-observation combinations.



description

     statpack  is  an  integrated,  interactive  package  written  for
terminal  use.   it  allows the user to issue simple commands for data
analysis  and  will  prompt  him  for  necessary  information.    when
questions  of  a  procedural  nature  arise,  the  user may ask for an
additional explanation by simply typing "help".  the  standard  output
device  is  the  terminal;  however, a command is available to channel
output to the line printer, providing the user  with  the  ability  to
obtain multiple copies.

     data input may be  from  terminal,  disk,  magnetic  tape,  or  a
structured  data bank.  input consists of observations each containing
a value for every variable.  variables are defined by a number  or  an
alphabetic  name  of  not  more  than  five  characters.  data must be
entered before issuing any of the statistical commands.  once data has
been  entered,  the  statistical  commands  will continue analyzing it
until the data is modified or replaced.  options exist for  evaluating
data with missing values.  it is also possible to restrict the data to
only those observations where a certain set of circumstances occurs.

         table of variable-observation combinations
         ------------------------------------------

     the   following   is   a   table   illustrating    the    various
variable-observation  data  combinations  that  can  be  processed  by
statpack.  letting the rows represent the number of  observations  and
the  columns  represent  the  number  of  variables,  one  can  easily
determine if  a  specific  variable-observation  data  combination  is
possible  by  simply  determining  the  point  where the variable line
crosses the observation line.  a "yes" indicates that the  combination
is possible; a blank indicates that statpack cannot analyze the amount
of data necessary for that variable-observation combination.

program transfer
----------------



purpose:  initiate the run of another program while in statpack


description:  stat pack may be used to  transfer  control  to  another
     program  (initiate  a  run  to  a  different  program).   as  the
     following programs become available, they may be called  directly
     from stat pack.

          bank
          freq
          tab
          corl
          regr


     when a call to another program is executed, the output  file  (if
     one  has  been  created)  is  queued  to the lineprinter, and the
     program specified is executed.  to run a program type a  "/"  and
     the program name in response to "which command?".


example:

     which command?  /bank

     bank?

statpack v4                                         PAGE   7



command:  acbnk
---------------


purpose:  read data from a binary structured data bank.   options  are
     available  to  subset data, bypass observations which do not meet
     user  specified  criteria,  and  reject  observations  containing
     missing  values.   provisions  have been made for variable names,
     and elimination of input formats.


limitations:  data must be in the form of a well-structured data bank.
     a maximum of 20 variables may be accessed at one time.


description:  the "acbnk" command is used to read data from  a  stored
     structured  data  bank  located  on the disk.  when prompted, the
     user types the name of  the  bank  (no  extension  is  necessary;
     ".bnk"  will  automatically be added), and the project-programmer
     number enclosed in brackets (if other than his own), of the  area
     where the file containing the bank is located.

          this is followed by the switches  enclosed  in  parentheses,
     which are representative of the options available.  if no options
     are desired, no options are necessary.  options are:

          "i" - independent samples
          "m" - allow observations with missing data to be recovered
          "q" - select observations to be used by specifying  criteria
                they must satisfy
          "s" - specify starting position

          next the user is asked to indicate which variables are to be
     read.   bank codes (the number of the variable as situated in the
     bank) or variable names are typed in separated by commas.  ranges
     of  variables  may be entered by typing the extremes of the range
     separated by a "-".  if all variables are to be read use  a  "*".
     it  should  be  noted  that the first bank code specified becomes
     statpack's first  variable,  the  second  bank  code  the  second
     variable,  etc.   thus, bank code 1 may end up as variable number
     4.  although the variable name  obs  is  illegal,  the  user  may
     indicate  this  variable  both  as a variable to be read and as a
     qualifier.  the observation number will be referenced.  in stp if
     obs is read as a variable it will be changed to obser.

          if no options are specified,  data  will  be  considered  an
     observation  at  a time, starting with the first observation.  if
     any of the variables to be recovered  contain  missing  data  for
     that  observation, the entire observation is discarded.  stp will
     continue in this manner, always checking  the  next  observation,
     until  either the entire bank has been considered or the data set
     whose size was specified at the beginning has been filled.

statpack v4                                         PAGE   8



          if an "s" switch is specified, the user  will  be  asked  to
     supply  the  starting observation number for the bank.  any value
     between 1 and the number of the last observation in the bank  may
     be  used.   this  does  not, however, inhibit the "acbnk" command
     from checking the entire bank for data.

          an "m" switch allows the collecting  of  samples  containing
     missing  data.   the  number  "-9999e-20"  will be used to denote
     values which are missing.

          the "q" switch specifies the qualifying  option.   by  using
     the  "q" switch, a user may select a subset of the bank where all
     the observations conform to a  certain  user-specified  criteria.
     for  example,  data  may  be chosen where each observation in the
     data set is a male, less than 15 years old, with an i.q.  of over
     110.

          if the "q" switch has been specified, the user is instructed
     to type one qualifier after each "?".  each qualifier consists of
     three parts:   a variable, a relationship,  and  a  value  to  be
     compared  with  the  variable.  hence, before each observation is
     included in the data set  it  must  satisfy  all  the  qualifiers
     specified.   (for  each  observation to be accepted, the variable
     selected in each qualifier must have the  indicated  relationship
     to the value specified.) the relationships possible are:

          sign code      alpha code         relationship
          ---------      ----------         ------------
          "="            ",eq," or ".eq."   equal
          "<>" or "><"   ",ne," or ".ne."   not equal
          ">"            ",gt," or ".gt."   greater than
          "<"            ",lt," or ".lt."   less than
          ">=" or "=>"   ",ge," or ".ge."   greater than or equal to
          "<=" or "=<"   ",le," or ".le."   less than or equal to

          the qualifier is constructed by typing the variable  (either
     number  or  name),  the  sign code or alpha code, and finally the
     value.  when the last qualifier has been entered, return and type
     a  ^z(control  z),  a  <cr>, or "stop"(the stop typed here simply
     terminates entry of the qualifiers, it is not  the  same  as  the
     "stop" command).  the maximum number of qualifiers possible is 20
     minus the number of variables selected for entry to the data set.
     it  is not necessary to access a variable as data in order to use
     it as a qualifier.

          the "i" switch is used to assemble samples  where  variables
     in  the  same observation may not be related.  for example, it is
     possible for variable 1 to be the i.q.  of males and  variable  2
     the  i.q.   of  females.   each  variable  or set of variables is
     collected by looking through the entire data set once.  when  the
     last  sample  has been recovered, type a <cr> or a ^z(control z).
     all variables are forced to have the same number of observations.

explanations:

     (1)  read from data bank nick under area [220,220] the variables:
     case, 2, 3, weight, and sex.

     (2)  read from data bank nick under area [220,220] the variables:
     case, 2, 3, weight, and sex beginning with observation 123 in the
     bank.

     (3)  read from data bank nick the variables: case,  sex,  weight,
     and   variable   numbers   7  through  11;  but  only  use  those
     observations where the variable: sex is equal to 1,  variable:  2
     is  not  equal  to  499.3,  variable:  3 is greater than 1.2, and
     weight is not equal to 189.

     (4)  read from data bank rslt the variables: iq, sex, and weight.
     starting  at  the  bank's  observation  number 121 and using only
     those observations where the variable: iq is  greater  than  115,
     the  variable: sex is equal to 1 and the variable: weight is less
     than or equal to 210.

     (5)  read  independent  samples  from  bank  nick,  breaking  the
     variable: weight into four variables each recovered as a separate
     sample where:

          each observation for sample 1 has the variable: sex equal to
               1 and variable: age less than 24; 
          each observation for sample 2 has the variable: sex equal to
               1 and variable: age greater than or equal to 24;
          each observation for sample 3 has the variable: sex equal to
               2 and variable: age less than 24; and
          each observation for sample 4 has the variable: sex equal to
               2 and variable: age greater than or equal to 24.

     when finished there will be four separate variables each made  up
     of a particular portion of the population.

command:  anoc1
---------------


purpose:  perform one way analysis of covariance


limitations:  the sum of  the  treatments  and  covariances  must  not
     exceed 20.


reference:  "statistical methods", snedecor and cochran, chapter 14.


description:  the "anoc1" command calculates  analysis  of  covariance
     for  one or more sets of data.  the user will first be instructed
     to enter the options desired,  separated  by  commas.   available
     options are:

     "break"--rather than supplying a variable for each  cell  of  the
          analysis  of  covariance, separate a single variable and one
          or more covariate variables into treatments based on  values
          of a breakdown variable.

     "discr"--use values of the breakdown  variable  to  form  ranges,
          with each distinct value forming a separate range.  (if this
          option is not used the user will be asked  to  enter  ranges
          for the breakdown variable).

     "auto"--same results as "discr", however "auto"  is  not  entered
          when the other options are entered, it is entered when asked
          for ranges.

     "range"--list ranges calculated.  (only available if  "discr"  is
          used).


          if no options are specified, the user will be asked to enter
     the  variables  to  be used as treatments.  each variable entered
     becomes a  separate  treatment.   variables  may  be  entered  by
     variable number or if names have been defined, as variable names.
     ranges of variables may be entered by typing the extremes of this
     range  separated  by  a "-".  next the user will be instructed to
     enter the number of covariates.  for  each  treatment,  the  user
     will  be asked to enter a variable to be used for each covariate.
     either variable numbers or variable names  (if  names  have  been
     defined)  may  be  used.   ranges  of variables may be entered by
     typing the extremes of the range separated by a "-".  no variable
     may  be used as both a treatment and a covariate, and no variable
     may be used as two covariates.

          if "break" was specified as an  option,  the  user  will  be
     instructed  to  enter  the  variables  to  be analysed.  up to 20

statpack v4                                         PAGE  13



     variables may be entered  separated  by  commas.   variables  are
     indicated by variable number or variable name (if names have been
     defined for the variables).  ranges of variables may  be  entered
     by typing the extremes of the range separated by a "-".  for each
     variable specified, a separate analysis  of  covariance  will  be
     calculated.   the  user will then be asked to enter the breakdown
     variable.  only one variable may be entered, by  either  variable
     number or variable name (if names have been defined).

          if option "discr" was not supplied then  the  user  will  be
     requested  to  enter the ranges for the breakdown variable.  each
     range is entered on a separate line, minimum first, followed by a
     comma,  and  then  the  maximum.  if names are to be given to the
     ranges, the user should enter a comma and the name (5  characters
     or  less)  following  the  maximum  of the range.  after the last
     range has been entered, type a control z (^z) or line  feed.   if
     the user wishes the ranges to be automatically created "auto" may
     be used.

          the  user  will  now  be  instructed  to  enter   covariates
     separated  by  commas.  either variable numbers or variable names
     (if names have been defined) may be used.   ranges  of  variables
     may be entered by typing the extremes of the range separated by a
     "-".  the covariates will be broken into the same groups  as  the
     treatments.

command:  anov1
---------------


purpose:  calculate one way analysis of variance


reference:  "statistical principles in  experimental  design",  winer,
     pages 96-102.


description:  the "anov1" command allows the user to calculate one-way
     analysis  of variance.  the user will first be instructed to list
     the options desired  separated  by  commas  (if  no  options  are
     desired type a <cr>).  possible options are:

     "break"--select samples from one variable based on the value of a
          second  variable.   for  each  observation, the value of the
          second  variable  (breakdown  variable)  will  be  used   to
          determine  in  which  sample  the  variable  being  analyzed
          belongs.  this is accomplished by  determining  which  of  a
          series  of  ranges  the value of the breakdown variable fits
          into, and then moving the value of the analysis variable  to
          the  corresponding sample.  (if this option is not used, the
          analysis will be done using variables as the samples.)

       note:  the following options are to be used only if "break" has
          been used.

     "discr"--automatic  breakdown.   instead  of  the  user  entering
          ranges,  a  separate range will be created automatically for
          each value in the breakdown variable.

     "auto"--automatic breakdown.  this option  is  the  same  as  the
          "discr" option.  do not enter "auto" with the other options;
          it should be entered only when asked to type in the  ranges.
          the  "discr"  and  "auto"  options are equivalent.  the only
          difference is  at  which  point  in  the  program  they  are
          entered.

       note:  the following option  is  available  only  if  automatic
          breakdowns are to be used.

     "range"--list the ranges to be used for the automatic breakdown.


          if the "break" option has not been specified,  the  analysis
     of  variance  will  be calculated with each variable specified by
     the user occupying a single cell.  when instructed the user lists
     the variables to be used in the analysis of variance separated by
     commas.  up to 30 variables may be indicated  by  variable  names
     (if  names  have  been  defined)  or variable numbers.  ranges of
     variables may be entered by listing the  extremes  of  the  range

statpack v4                                         PAGE  17



     separated by a "-".  one or more "*" may be used when listing the
     variables to be analyzed.  one at a time each  variable  not  yet
     specified  in  the  analysis  will  be substituted for every "*".
     those cases where the same variable would be listed twice in  the
     same  analysis  will  be  eliminated, as will be those cases that
     except for a switch in  the  order  of  variables,  duplicate  an
     analysis already performed.


          if the "break" option has been used, it  will  be  necessary
     for the user to supply the following information:

     (1)  the variables for which  analysis  of  variance  are  to  be
          calculated (up to 20).  the samples for each set of analysis
          of  variance  will  be  selected  from  a  single  variable.
          variables  may  be  listed  using  either variable names (if
          names have been defined) or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of
          variables  may  be  specified by listing the extremes of the
          ranges separated by a "-".  where analysis of variances  are
          to  be  calculated  for  all  variables,  a  "*" may be used
          instead of variable names or numbers.

     (2)  the variable to  be  used  for  the  breakdowns.   only  one
          variable  may  be  entered, specified by either its variable
          name (if the name has been defined) or variable number.  all
          variables  listed  for  analysis will be processed using the
          same breakdown variable.

     (3)  ranges for the breakdown variable.  if  the  "discr"  option
          has  been  used,  this  information  will  be  automatically
          calculated, and need not be supplied by the  user.   if  the
          "discr" option has not been used, the user may still request
          the ranges to be automatically calculated by responding with
          "auto".   to  specify ranges, the user types the extremes of
          the range, smaller first, separated by a  comma.   only  one
          range  may  be  entered  per  line.   up to 50 ranges may be
          specified.  after the last range has been entered, the  user
          types a ^z(control z).

command:  anov2
---------------


purpose:  calculate two-way analysis of variance.


reference:  "topics in intermediate statistical methods", snedecor and
     cochran, pages 104-106.


description:  the "anov2" command allows the user  to  calculate  two-
     way  analysis  of variance.  the user will first be instructed to
     list the options desired separated by commas (if no  options  are
     desired type a <cr>).  possible options are:

     "headr"--eliminate means and standard deviation report.

     "break"--select samples from one variable based on the  value  of
          two other variables.  for each observation, the value of the
          two  variables  (breakdown  variables)  will  be   used   to
          determine in which cell the variable being analyzed belongs.
          this is accomplished by determining which  of  a  series  of
          ranges  each  breakdown  variable fits into, and then moving
          the value of the  analysis  variable  to  the  corresponding
          cell.   (if  this option is not used, variables will be used
          as cells).

       note:  the following options are to be used only if the "break"
          option is specified.

     "discr"--establish   ranges   for   the    breakdown    variables
          automatically.   rather  than  the user typing in ranges for
          the  breakdown  variables,  ranges  will  be   automatically
          calculated  for  each  breakdown  variable  in the following
          manner:
           1)  if a breakdown variable has fewer discrete values  than
               defined  groups,  a  range  will be calculated for each
               value of the breakdown variable.
           2)  if a breakdown variable has more  discrete  value  than
               defined  groups,  a range will be calculated by finding
               the difference between the maximum and  minimum  values
               of the breakdown variable and separating the difference
               into ranges; so that there is a range for each  defined
               group and all the ranges have equal intervals.

     "auto"--if the "discr" option has not  been  used  and  the  user
          wishes  to have ranges created automatically for a breakdown
          variable, he may type "auto" when instructed  to  enter  the
          ranges  for a particular breakdown variable.  ranges will be
          calculated in the same manner as for "discr".  do not  enter
          "auto"  with  the  other  options; it should be entered only
          when instructed to type in the ranges.

statpack v4                                         PAGE  21



     "group"--specify number of groups (used when  groups  are  to  be
          automatically broken down).  preset to a maximum of 20.

       note:  the following is available only if automatic  breakdowns
          are used.

     "range"--list the ranges to be used for automatic breakdown.


          if the "break" option has not been specified,  the  analysis
     of   variance  will  be  created  with  each  specified  variable
     occupying a cell.  the user  will  be  asked  for  the  following
     information:
      1)  number of levels for factor 1.  any number between 1 and  20
          is acceptable.
      2)  number of levels for factor 2.  any number between 1 and  20
          is acceptable.
      3)  the variable to be put in each cell.  one at a time the user
          will  be asked to specify which variable to be put into each
          cell.  either the variable name (if names have been defined)
          or the variable number may be used to indicate the variable.
          if a cell is empty the user  may  indicate  this  by  typing
          "empty".   a "*" may also be used in one or more cells.  one
          at a time each variable not yet specified  in  the  analysis
          will be substituted for every "*".


          if the break option has been specified, it will be necessary
     for the user to supply the following information:
      1)  if the "group" option has been selected, the  user  will  be
          asked  to  indicate  how  many  groups  comprise a breakdown
          variable.  each breakdown variable can have 1 to 20 groups.
      2)  the variables for which the analyses are to be performed for
          each two-way analysis of variance, the values comprising all
          the cells will be selected from the same variable.  up to 40
          variables  may  be  entered  using either variable names (if
          names have been defined) or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of
          variables  may  be  specified by listing the extremes of the
          ranges separated by a "-".  where analysis of  variance  are
          to  be  calculated  for  all  variables,  a  "*" may be used
          instead of variable numbers or names.
      3)  the user will be asked to supply both  breakdown  variables.
          either  variable  names  (if  names  have  been  defined) or
          variable numbers may be used.
      4)  if the "discr" option was not specified, the  user  will  be
          expected  to  enter the ranges for the breakdowns.  up to 20
          ranges may be submitted.  each range is indicated by  typing
          the  extremes  (smaller  first)  separated by a comma.  when
          finished  entering  ranges  for  either  of  the   breakdown
          variables,  type  a  ^z(control  z).   if  ranges  are to be
          calculated automatically  for  a  breakdown  variable,  type
          "auto".

command:  assign
----------------


purpose:  assign output to the line printer.


description:  the "assign" command allows the user to print results on
     the  line  printer.   this  command  must  be  given prior to any
     commands for which the output is  to  be  assigned  to  the  line
     printer.  once the command has been given, no other responses are
     necessary.  output will remain assigned to the line printer until
     a  "deass" command is given.  it is permissible to channel output
     back and forth between the line printer and  terminal  using  the
     "assign"  and "deass" commands.  questions to the user will still
     be asked via the terminal.  while output is assigned,  no  output
     will appear on the terminal.

note: a "fini" command must be used to initiate printing of the output
     assigned  to the line printer.  it is necessary to use the "fini"
     command to ensure printing of the results  which  were  assigned.
     for multiple copies of the results use the "copys" command.

     which command?  assign

command:  bargr
---------------


purpose:  create bargraphs


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, page 27.


description:  the "bargr" command allows user to construct one or more
     bargraphs.   when  instructed,  the  user  enters  the  variables
     separated by commas for which the bargraphs are  to  be  created.
     up to 20 variables may be entered using either the variable names
     (if names have been defined)  or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of
     variables  may  be  indicated by typing the extremes of the range
     separated by a "-".  where bargraphs are to  be  constructed  for
     all  variables,  a  "*" may be used in place of variable names or
     numbers.

          the user will next be instructed to enter the ranges for the
     bargraphs.   ranges  are  entered  1  per  line,  minimum  first,
     followed by a comma and the maximum.  when  the  last  range  has
     been  entered,  a control z (^z) or a blank line should be typed.
     ranges may be calculated automatically, by  placing  each  unique
     value  in  an  individual range, or if more than 40 values exist,
     then 40 ranges are created each with an equal interval.  to  have
     the  ranges automatically calculated the user should respond with
     "auto" when instructed to enter the ranges.  if auto is used, and
     the  user wishes to limit the number of ranges to be created, the
     "auto" should be followed by a "/"  and  the  maximum  number  of
     ranges the user desires.

command:  chisq
---------------


purpose:  calculate chi square


limitation:  chisq will only calculate the chi  square  for  raw  data
     already  entered  into  statpack.   there  are  no provisions for
     calculating a chi square from a pre-calculated table.


reference:  "non-parametric statistics", siegel, pages 42-47, 104-111,
     196-202.


description:  the "chisq" command allows the user to calculate  either
     a  one-variable  or a two-variables chi square.  options exist to
     group certain values together prior to  forming  the  contingency
     table,  and  collapsing  the  table  once  it  is  formed.   when
     instructed to list the  options,  the  user  enters  the  options
     desired  separated  by  commas (if no options are desired, type a
     <cr>).  possible options are:

     group--group certain ranges of values together prior  to  forming
            the contingency table
     contg--eliminate contingency table from final output
     colps--collapse contingency table (includes omitting)
     fishr--calculate fishers exact probability (2x2 table only)

          when instructed to enter variables, the user  enters  either
     one  or  two  variables  separated  by a comma.  variables may be
     listed by variable names (if names have been defined) or variable
     numbers.   if  a  one-variable  chi  square  is  desired  for all
     variables, the user may enter a "*".  similarly,  a  two-variable
     chi  square  between  a  single  variable  and  all the remaining
     variables may be entered by typing the variable which  is  to  be
     analyzed  with  all  others, a comma, and a "*".  if two variable
     chi squares are to be  calculated  between  all  combinations  of
     variables, a "*,*" may be used.

          if the "group" option has  been  given,  the  user  will  be
     allowed to enter ranges for grouping certain values together.  up
     to 15 ranges may be entered for  each  variable,  one  range  per
     line.  each range is entered by typing the extremes of the range,
     smaller first separated by a comma.  to finish  entering  ranges,
     type  a  "stop" (this stop terminates the entry of ranges - it is
     not the same as the "stop" command), <cr>, or ^z(control z).

          if the "colps" option has  been  given,  the  user  will  be
     expected  to  enter  instructions  for collapsing the contingency
     table.  each  instruction  is  composed  of  a  single  character
     indicating  what  is  to  be done, a variable name (if names have

statpack v4                                         PAGE  31



     been defined) or variable number enclosed in parentheses,  and  a
     string of numbers referencing levels to be acted upon.

          single letter codes possible are:
                     c--combine levels
                     d---delete levels

          the variable enclosed in parentheses  must  be  one  of  the
     variables  being  analyzed.   the string of numbers represent the
     level numbers in the contingency table  which  are  to  be  acted
     upon.   ranges  of  levels  may also be indicated by entering the
     extremes  of  the  range  separated   by   a   "-".    collapsing
     instructions  are  entered  one  per  line.   when finished, type
     "stop" or ^z(control z).

          the probability and contingency coefficient will be supplied
     with  the chi square.  in the case of a 2 x 2 table the corrected
     chi square will also be calculated.  if in  a  two  variable  chi
     square only one level exists for either of the variables, the chi
     square will be calculated as a one-variable test.

command:  copys
---------------


purpose:  obtain multiple copies of output.


limitation:  maximum of 63 copies


description:  the "copys" command allows the user to  obtain  multiple
     copies  of  output.  when requested, the user types in the number
     of copies desired.  up to 63 copies may  be  requested.   if  the
     number  entered  is  less  than  or  equal to zero, the number of
     copies will default to one.

          the "copys" command is used in conjunction with the  "print"
     and  "assign"  commands.   it  may  be issued at anytime prior to
     either the "print" command (for a printing of the  data)  or  the
     "fini"  command  (for  the  output  that was assigned to the line
     printer).  once the number of copies has  been  entered,  it  can
     only be changed by another "copys" command.


example:

     which command?  copys

     how many output copies?  3

description:  the "corr" command  displays  the  computed  correlation
     matrix  for  all  variables  in  the  data  set.   only the lower
     triangular portion of the correlation matrix will  be  displayed,
     adjusting  the  number  of correlations per line to fully utilize
     the area available for the output.  no  responses  are  necessary
     once  the  command  has  been given.  output will be labeled with
     variable names, if they have been defined; otherwise numbers will
     be used.

purpose:  calculate correlated t tests


reference:  "statistical methods", snedecor and cochran, pages 92-97.


description:  the  "corrt"  command  allows  the  user  to   calculate
     correlated  t tests for all combinations of variables.  after the
     command is given, no other user responses are necessary.

          output will be labeled with variable names  (if  names  have
     been  defined)  or variable numbers.  results will be adjusted to
     fully utilize space available for output.

command:  cvsmt
---------------


purpose:  forecasting


reference:  "decision rules for inventory management", r.  g.  brown.


description:  the "cvsmt" command utilizes  an  exponential  smoothing
     model  in  forecasting  cases,  where  time  is  the  independent
     variable and assumed the only condition changing.  the user  will
     first  be  instructed  to enter the variables separated by commas
     for which forecasts are to be made.  up to 20  variables  may  be
     listed,  by  variables  names  (if  names  have  been defined) or
     variable numbers.  ranges of variables may be specified by typing
     the  extremes  of the range separated by a "-".  if forecasts are
     to be made for all variables the user may respond with a "*".

          the user will next be instructed to enter options  separated
     by commas.  possible options are:

          "nlogy"--natural log transformation  of  dependent  variable
               (for  each  observation the natural log of the variable
               will be used in the calculations).
          "nlogt"--natural log transformation of time
          "trend"--user enters trend line
          "short"--short  output  (trend  line,  variance,   projected
               values)
          "multi"--multiplicative rather than additive seasonal terms

          if no options are desired type a <cr>.

          the  user  will  now  be  told  to  enter  the   number   of
     observations  per  cycle.   at  least  two cycles of data must be
     present to establish a forecasting model.

          next the user will be asked to enter the weighting  factors.
     one  at  a  time he will be prompted for the trend, steady state,
     and seasonal factors.

          finally the user will be instructed to enter the  percentage
     criteria  for  seasonal  terms.   those periods that consistently
     deviate from the expected values by this percentage in the  first
     two cycles are assumed to have seasonal effects.

          if the user has specified the "trend" option he will also be
     instructed  to  enter  the  trend  line.  this is accomplished by
     typing first the y intercept and then the slope when prompted.

command:  data
--------------


purpose:  enter data from terminal.


description:  the  "data"  command  allows  users  to  enter  data  by
     terminal  according to a standard or user specified format.  with
     standard format, the user enters values separated by commas  with
     a  maximum  of  20 values per line.  if 20 values will not fit on
     one line, use the  "form"  command  prior  to  "data".   data  is
     entered  by  observation,  the  first value being variable 1, the
     second value, variable 2, etc.  when  finished  typing  the  last
     observation, type a ^z(control z).


example:

     which command?  data

     how many input variables?  3

     enter input data

command:  deass
---------------


purpose:  reassign output to terminal from line printer.


description:  the "deass" command allows the user to  reassign  output
     to  the terminal.  once the command has been given, no other user
     responses are necessary.  this command  is  used  in  conjunction
     with  the  "assign" command.  it is permissible to channel output
     back and forth between the line printer and  terminal  using  the
     "assign" and "deass" commands.


example:

     which command?  deass

command:  facto
---------------


purpose:  calculate factor analysis


reference:  "scientific subroutine package".


description:  the "facto" command  allows  the  user  to  calculate  a
     factor  analysis  for selected variables.  the user will first be
     instructed to enter  the  options  separated  by  commas  (if  no
     options are necessary type a <cr>).  possible options are:

          "const"--specify constant to decide how many eigenvalues  to
                   retain
          "evect"--include eigenvectors in output
          "factm"--include factor matrix in output
          "varia"--include variances in output
          "commu"--include communalities in output
          "fscor"--include factor scores in output
          "sfscr"--save factor scores
          "all"----include all above options


          if the "const" option has  been  specified,  the  user  will
     first  be  asked  to  supply  the  constant  value  for retaining
     eigenvalues.  unless the "const" option is specified, a  constant
     value of 1.0 is assumed.

          when  instructed  the  user  should  enter  the   variables,
     separated  by  commas  for  which  the  factor  analysis is to be
     calculated.  up to 40  variables  may  be  entered  using  either
     variable  names (if names have been defined) or variable numbers.
     ranges of variables may be indicated by typing  the  extremes  of
     the  range  separated by a "-".  one or more "*" may be used when
     listing the variables  to  be  analyzed.   one  at  a  time  each
     variable  not  yet  specified in the analysis will be substituted
     for every "*".  those cases where  the  same  variable  would  be
     listed  twice in the same analysis will be eliminated, as will be
     those cases that  except  for  a  switch  in  the  order  of  the
     variables, duplicate an analysis already performed.

command:  fetch
---------------


purpose:  enter data which is stored on disk.


limitation:  will not input binary files.


description:  "fetch" allows the user  to  read  data  from  the  disk
     according  to  a  standard format (separated by commas) or a user
     specified format.  to specify his own format, the user must  give
     a  "form"  command  prior to the "fetch".  in specifying the disk
     file to be used for input, the name and extension must  be  typed
     in  separated  by  a  period.   by adding another user's project-
     programmer number enclosed in brackets, the  data  will  be  read
     from that area assuming the protection is correct.


example:

     which command?  fetch

     what is the filename and extension?  file.dat[420,420]

     how many input variables?  2

command:  fini
--------------


purpose:  terminate execution of stat pack.


description:  the  "fini"  command  allows  the  user   to   terminate
     execution  of  stat  pack.   once  the command has been given, no
     other responses are necessary.  output that was assigned  to  the
     line  printer  will be entered into the print queue for printing.
     the user will also be informed of the connect time and cpu time.

note: the "fini" command must be used to ensure printing of results in
     instances where the output was assigned to the line printer.


example:

     which command?  fini

     cpu time: 4:22.68       elapsed time: 32:49.12
     no execution errors detected

     exit

command:  form
--------------


purpose:  specify input format.


limitation:  no fixed point or alphanumeric formats.


description:  when requested, the user enters a floating point  format
     enclosed   in  parentheses.   the  total  length  of  the  format
     including the parentheses may be up to 480 characters.  more than
     1 line may be used to enter the format.  blanks within lines will
     be removed.  a format of (20f) is assumed  at  the  beginning  of
     each  stp  run,  but  a  "form" command replaces it with the user
     specified format.


example:

     which command?  form

     enter your f-type data input format enclosed in parentheses
     (2x,3f1.0,1x,2f2.0,1x,f3.0,3x,f2.0)

command:  freq
--------------


purpose:  produce frequency tables


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, pages 16-19.


description:  the "freq" command  is  used  to  produce  frequency  of
     occurrence tables for one or more variables.  the user will first
     be asked if he desires percentages, to which the response must be
     a  "yes"  or  "no".  next the user will be instructed to list the
     variables separated by commas for which  frequencies  are  to  be
     tabulated.   up  to  40  variables  may  be  entered using either
     variable names (if names have been defined) or variable  numbers.
     ranges  of  variables  may be specified by typing the extremes of
     the range separated by  a  "-".   where  frequencies  are  to  be
     tabulated  for  all  variables,  a  "*"  may  be  substituted for
     variable names and numbers.  the tabled results will be  labeled,
     and size of table adjusted to utilize space available for output.


note: positive and negative numbers as well as multiple digit  numbers
     may be processed with this command.


example:

     which command?  freq

     do you also want percentages (yes or no)?  yes

command:  help
--------------


purpose:  answer questions, supply alternatives.


description:  the "help" command  is  used  when  the  response  to  a
     question  is  not  obvious.   it  will  supply  the  user with an
     explanation of what is necessary, the  options  available,  or  a
     list  of  commands.  once the explanation or information has been
     supplied, the question will be restated,  allowing  the  user  to
     continue.


examples:

          which command?  help

          commands are broken into 6 groups:

          "dc" - data control
          "es" - elementary statistics
          "gr" - graphs
          "ia" - item analysis
          "as" - advanced statistics
          "pc" - program control
          "al" - complete command code list

          which set (type in the 2 character code)? dc

          commands available

          "data"  - data input by tty
          "fetch" - read data from disk
          "form"  - enter special input format
          "manip" - manipulate data in core (includes appending)
          "trans" - data transformations
          "store" - store data on disk
          "print" - print selected variables on line printer
          "type"  - type out selected variables on tty
          "acbnk" - access a stored data bank
          "mta/i" - read data from mag tape

          which command?  fetch

          what is the file name and extension? help

          the fetch command is used to read data from 
          the disk. both the file name and extension must be
          specified. in order to read from another area the
          project, programmer number must be inserted in brackets
          directly adjoining the name and extension.

command:  hist
--------------


purpose:  create histograms


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, pages 25-27.


description:  the "hist" command allows the user to construct  one  or
     more  histograms.  when instructed, the user enters the variables
     separated by commas for which the histograms are to  be  created.
     up to 20 variables may be entered using either the variable names
     (if names have been defined)  or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of
     variables  may  be  indicated by typing the extremes of the range
     separated by a "-".  where histograms are to  be  calculated  for
     all  variables,  a "*" may be used in place of variable names and
     numbers.

          scaling will  be  automatically  done  with  the  number  of
     divisions  determined  by  the  space  available for output.  the
     range of values included in each division will be listed  in  the
     output,  as  well as the frequency and percentage of observations
     falling into each division.


example:

     which command?  hist

     which variables?  weight,height

command:  info
--------------


purpose:  give the user a general program description.


description:  the "info" command allows the new user to obtain a brief
     description  of  the program while sitting at the terminal.  once
     the command has been given, no  other  responses  are  necessary.
     the text will simply be typed out.


example:

     which command? info

     stat pack is an integrated statistical package, written for
     terminal use. it allows the user to issue simple commands
     for data analysis. the program is in conversational mode and
     will prompt the user for desired information. in most instances
     when questions of procedure arise the user may request further
     information, by simply typing "help". standard form of output
     is terminal, but output may easily be channeled to the
     printer.  input is readily accepted from terminal or disk.

     input consists of observations, each containing a value for
     all of the variables. each observation must begin a new line.
     the data may be input in either of two ways: 1) one observation
     per line with values separated by commas; or 2) according
     to your own input format which is entered using the command
     "form". after the last observation enter a ^z (cntrl z).

     to see the command list type "help" after "which command?"
     and "al" for the 2 character code. a restriction on 
     data input is: 20 numbers maximum per line under
     standard format. if a line requires more than 72
     columns use your own input format.

command:  kolm
----------------


purpose:  calculate one or two sample kolmogorov-smirnov tests.


reference:  "statistical methods", b.  h.  lindgren, pages 329-335.


description:  the "kolm" command allows user to calculate one  or  two
     sample   kolmogorov-smirnov   tests.   the  user  will  first  be
     instructed to enter the options desired separated by commas.

     possible options are:

                    *** one sample options ***

     norml--test the  variables  to  be  specified  against  a  normal
          distribution.  (if no options are specified this will be the
          default).

     expon--test the variables to be specified against an  exponential
          distribution.

     cauch--test the  variables  to  be  specified  against  a  cauchy
          distribution.

     unifm--test the variables to  be  specified  against  an  uniform
          distribution.

     total--test the variables  to  be  specified  against  a  normal,
          cauchy, uniform, and exponential distributions.

     suppl--normally the parameters calculated from the sample will be
          used  to specify the distribution being tested, however, the
          suppl option allows the user to enter his own parameters for
          the distributions.


                    *** two sample options ***

     2samp--indicates test will be  a  two  sample  kolmogorov-smirnov
          test.

     break--rather  than  having  the  two  samples  coming  from  two
          variables,  select  the  two  samples from a single variable
          based on the value of another variable (breakdown variable).
          this option is available only if "2samp" has been used.

     discr--ranges calculated  automatically  with  a  separate  range
          created  for  each unique value.  if this option is not used
          it will be necessary for the user to enter the  ranges.   if

statpack v4                                         PAGE  62



          more than 20 unique values exist for the breakdown variable,
          it will also be necessary for  the  user  to  enter  ranges.
          this option only available if "break" is used.

     range--list ranges calculated.  this  option  only  available  if
          "discr" is used.


          for the one sample test the user will be instructed to enter
     the  variables  to be tested against the distributions specified.
     up to 20 variables may be entered separated by commas.   variable
     numbers  or  variable  names  (if names have been defined) may be
     used to indicate the  variables.   ranges  of  variables  may  be
     specified  by  entering  the extremes of the range separated by a
     "-".  if all variables are to be tested the user may use  a  "*".
     no  other  responses  are  necessary  unless the suppl option was
     specified.  if  "suppl"  was  used,  the  user  must  supply  the
     parameters for the various distributions when requested.

          for the two sample test the user will be instructed to enter
     the  variables separated by commas.  up to 20 variable numbers or
     variable names (if names  have  been  defined)  may  be  entered.
     ranges  of  variables  may be specified by typing the extremes of
     the range separated by a "-".  if all variables are to be used an
     "*"  may  be  entered.  if the break option has not been used, no
     other information need be entered.  if the break option has  been
     used,  it  will  be necessary for the user to enter the breakdown
     variable.  either the variable number or variable name (if  names
     have  been  defined)  may be used.  if the option "discr" has not
     been specified the user must enter the ranges for  the  breakdown
     variable.   up  to  20  ranges  for  the  breakdown  variable are
     entered, one range per  line.   each  range  is  comprised  of  a
     minimum  for  the  range,  a comma, and a maximum.  when the last
     range has been entered, type a control z (^z) or carriage return.

command:  mabnk
---------------


purpose:  create a bank from data in stp.


description:  the "mabnk" command allows users to  make  a  bank  file
     from  data  located  in  stp.   when  the  name  for  the bank is
     requested,  the  user  should  type  in  a  name  of  at  most  6
     characters;  no  extension  is  necessary  as  a  ".bnk"  will be
     supplied.  all variables in stp will be put into the bank in  the
     same  order  as  they  occur  in  stp.  if variable names are not
     assigned in stp, generated names of "v1", "v2", "v3",  ...,  will
     be  given  to  the  variables in the bank.  a standard protection
     code of <155> will be  assigned  to  the  bank  unless  otherwise
     specified by the user.

          banks are stored as binary random access files  to  increase
     recovery  speed,  and  eliminate  formatting  problems.   do  not
     attempt to print bank files; output will not be  meaningful,  and
     large amounts of line printer paper will be wasted.


example:

     which command?  mabnk

     bank name?  john

command:  make
--------------


purpose:  document output with one or more  pages  of  user  submitted
     information.


description:  the "make" command allows the user to insert one or more
     pages  of documentation into program generated output.  after the
     make command is issued, the user is instructed to enter his  page
     or pages of documentation.  when finished, the user types a <cr>,
     an altmode, and another <cr>.  the information submitted  by  the
     user  is  entered into the output only once, at that point in the
     output where the "make"  command  was  requested.   the  text  is
     transferred  to  the  output  line  by  line, thus corrections to
     previous lines are not possible.  if corrections are to  be  made
     to  the line currently being typed in, rubouts may be used.  each
     rubout used erases the previous character.  lines may  be  up  to
     120 characters long.

          a disk file may also be used as the text to be inserted into
     the output.  to specify a disk file the user types an "@" and the
     name of the file with the extension.  the file must reside in the
     area from which stat pack is being run.


examples:

     which command?  make

command:  manip
---------------


purpose:   correct mistakes in data, make allowances for missing data,
     add variables or observations, and modify or discard observations
     which do not meet certain criteria.


description:  "manip"  is  a  command  allowing  the  user  to   issue
     instructions  one  at  a time, to delete, type, modify, or add to
     data which has been entered in statpack.   each  instruction  has
     the following three parts:

a.  what operation is to be performed
          each instruction must have as the  first  character  a  code
     indicating what the instruction does.
          "a"-add to the data
          "d"-delete data
          "e"-return to "which command?"
          "r"-replace data with new values
          "t"-type data on terminal

b.  what portion of the data is to be acted upon by the operation
          this portion of  the  "manip"  instruction  indicates  which
     section  of the data is to be acted upon.  the observation number
     and variable number or name are  used  for  such  reference.   to
     indicate  a  particular  observation  an  "o"  is followed by the
     observation number.  to define a variable a "v"  is  followed  by
     the  variable  number  or if names are defined for the variables,
     the  name  enclosed  in  parentheses.   ranges  of  variables  or
     observations  may  be  indicated by following the "v" or "o" with
     the smallest number in the range, a "-" (dash), and finally  with
     the  largest  number  in the range.  when only those values which
     meet certain criteria are to be acted upon,  a  search  is  used.
     the  coding  for  a  search  consists  of  an  "s"  followed by a
     conditional code and a numerical value used as  a  reference  for
     the conditional code.  these codes are:
          ">" or "g"-greater than
          "<" or "l"-less than
          "=" or "e"-equal to

          the condition code is modified by the  value  which  follows
     it,  indicating the value to be searched for and the relationship
     that must be satisfied in order to act upon the data.


c.  what extra information is desired or previously defined
          during execution of instruction strings, a report is written
     on the terminal containing variable names or numbers, observation
     numbers,  and  values  at  these  points.   if  the   report   is
     unnecessary or unwanted, a "w" will cause it to be suppressed.  

statpack v4                                         PAGE  69



          normally, when an instruction has been issued to replace  or
     add data, the values to be inserted are supplied by the user, one
     at a time in response to a  single  question  mark.   a  constant
     value   to   be   used  for  that  instruction  may  be  supplied
     (eliminating the need to type in data upon cue), by  inserting  a
     "c"  followed  by  the  numeric value to be used as the constant.
     two special  constants  are  also  available:  the  mean  of  the
     variable, and the mean of the variable calculated by ignoring all
     occurrences of a particular value.  if the mean of  the  variable
     is to be used as the constant, replace the "c" and its associated
     value by an "m".   if  the  constant  to  be  used  is  the  mean
     calculated  by ignoring a particular value, as with missing data,
     replace the "m" with an "l" followed by the value to  be  ignored
     during calculation of the mean.

          when typing an  instruction  to  "manip"  there  may  be  no
     spaces,  and the first character must be the code indicating what
     is to be done.  no particular order must be maintained beyond the
     first character.  a double question mark indicates an instruction
     should be inserted.  a single question mark is used to indicate a
     numeric value is to be inserted for data.

command:  mann
--------------


purpose:  calculate mann-whitney u


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath,  pages  213,
     214.  "non-parametric statistics", siegel, pages 116-127.


description:  the  "mann"  command  allows  the  user   to   calculate
     mann-whitney  u.   the  user will first be instructed to list the
     options desired, separated by commas.  if no options are  desired
     type a <cr>.  possible options are:

     "break"--select samples from one variable based on the value of a
          second  variable.   for  each  observation, the value of the
          second  variable  (breakdown  variable)  will  be  used   to
          determine  in  which  sample  the  variable  being  analyzed
          belongs.  this is accomplished by  determining  which  of  a
          series  of  ranges  the value of the breakdown variable fits
          into, and then moving the value of the analysis variable  to
          the  corresponding  sample.   (if  this  option is not used,
          mann-whitney u's will be calculated between variables.)

       note:  the following options are to be used only if "break" has
          been used.

     "discr"--automatic  breakdown.   instead  of  the  user  entering
          ranges,  a  separate range will be created automatically for
          each value in the breakdown variable.

     "auto"--automatic breakdown.  this option  is  the  same  as  the
          "discr" option.  do not enter "auto" with the other options,
          it should be used only when asked to enter the ranges.   the
          "discr"   and   "auto"  options  are  equivalent;  the  only
          difference is  at  which  point  in  the  program  they  are
          entered.

       note:  the following option  is  available  only  if  automatic
          breakdown is to be used.

     "range"--list the ranges to be used for the automatic breakdown.


          if the "break" option has not been specified, mann-whitney u
     will  be  calculated between all possible pairs of variables.  no
     other user responses will be necessary.


          if the "break" option has been used, it  will  be  necessary
     for the user to supply the following information:

statpack v4                                         PAGE  75



     (1)  the variables for which mann-whitney u are to be  calculated
          (up to 20).  the samples for each set of mann-whitney u will
          be selected from a single variable.  variables may be listed
          using  either variable names (if names have been defined) or
          variable numbers.  ranges of variables may be  specified  by
          listing the extremes of the range separated by a "-".  where
          mann-whitney u's are to calculated for all variables, a  "*"
          may be used instead of variable names or numbers.

     (2)  the variable to  be  used  for  the  breakdowns.   only  one
          variable  may  be  entered, specified by either its variable
          name (if the name has been defined) or variable number.  all
          variables  listed  for  analysis will be processed using the
          same breakdown variable.

     (3)  ranges for the breakdown variable.  if  the  "discr"  option
          has  been  used,  this  information  will  be  automatically
          calculated, and need not be supplied by the  user.   if  the
          "discr" option has not been used, the user may still request
          the ranges be automatically calculated  by  responding  with
          "auto".   to  specify ranges, the user types the extremes of
          range, smaller first, separated by a comma.  only one  range
          may  be entered per line.  up to 50 ranges may be specified.
          after the last range has been  entered,  the  user  types  a
          ^z(control z).

command:  mta/i
---------------


purpose:  read data stored on  magnetic  tape,  with  the  ability  to
     select  variables,  and subset data (leave out observations which
     do not meet user specified criteria).


limitation:  data must be in ascii mode on magnetic tape, line-blocked
     and recorded at 556 bpi.  (these are normal w.m.u.  magnetic tape
     standards.) tape must be located at computer center or  given  to
     operator prior to run.


description:  the "mta/i" command is used  to  read  data  located  on
     magnetic  tapes.   if  the  format  of the tape is other than the
     standard format (20f) the "form" command should be used prior  to
     the  "mta/i"  command.  the user will first be instructed to type
     in some identification  for  the  tape.   a  single  line  of  26
     characters  should  be  typed  in,  containing  tape i.d.  no.(if
     available), name of user, or other identification.  this  message
     is sent to the operator, along with the project-programmer number
     of the user.  the operator has a choice of five  responses;  they
     are:  no  drives  are available, tape cannot be located, the user
     does not have one of the project-programmer numbers for which the
     tape  is  reserved, more information needed, or the tape has been
     mounted.  

          if a magnetic tape drive is free and the user may access the
     requested magnetic tape, the magnetic tape will be mounted on the
     free drive and the user informed of the  drive  number.   if  the
     tape  has not been mounted, check the following list to determine
     proper course of action:

            operator's reply                  action to be taken

                                        changes of proj-prog numbers
                                        which may access the tape.

     operator needs more                type in another line of up to
     information                        30 characters of i.d.

          the user will then be asked which position on the  tape  the
     file  he  wishes to access occupies.  if the file is the only one
     on the tape or was the first one written on  the  tape,  then  it
     occupies  position number 1.  if it was the second one written on
     the tape, then it occupies position number 2, etc.  when the user
     has  answered  this  question,  the  magtape  will advance to the
     proper file.  the user will then be asked how many  variables  it
     will  be necessary to look at.  this includes variables which may
     only be used as qualifiers.   next,  when  instructed,  the  user
     types  in  the  qualifiers  (50  maximum),  one  per line with no
     spaces.  each qualifier checks one variable to  make  certain  it
     contains  a specified value or range of values.  if the qualifier
     is not satisfied the observation being scrutinized is  discarded,
     and  the next observation considered.  each qualifier is composed
     of three parts: the number of the variable  to  be  checked,  the
     relationship  which must be satisfied if the observation is to be
     accepted, and the value which the variable is  compared  against.
     the relationships possible are:

                    ,eq, - equal
                    ,ne, - not equal
                    ,lt, - less than
                    ,gt, - greater than
                    ,le, - less than or equal to
                    ,ge, - greater than or equal to

          after the last qualifier has been  typed,  a  <cr>,  ^z,  or
     "stop"  may  be  typed.   the user is then instructed to list the
     numbers of the variables which are to be used as data,  separated
     by  commas.   the first variable listed becomes variable number 1
     in the data set, the  second  variable  listed  becomes  variable
     number  2,  etc.  when either the entire file has been considered
     or the data set has been filled, the user will be informed of the
     number of observations in the data set, and the number of records
     from which the data was selected.  when finished, before  logging
     off the computer, indicate to the operator to remove the magnetic
     tape from the drive.

command:  name
--------------


purpose:  assign names to variables


limitation:  maximum of five characters per name


description:  the "name" command allows the user to  assign  names  to
     variables.  one at a time, each variable number will be typed out
     followed by a question mark.  in response, the user may  type  in
     the  name  he  has  selected  for  that  variable, subject to the
     following limitations:

          (1) maximum of five characters
          (2) first character must be alphanumeric
          (3) ";", ",", "-", or blanks must not be present in the name
          (4) "all", "stop", "help", "empty", and "obs" are not  legal
          names
          (5) two variables must not be given the same name

          if it is not  necessary  to  name  a  variable,  or  if  the
     variable has been previously given a name and it does not need to
     be changed, the user may type a <cr>.

          names will be kept only until the end of the run or until  a
     new  set  of  data  is  read.  the "store" command does not store
     names with the data, if the names are necessary, they  will  have
     to be input each time the data is fetched.

          the names are primarily used to label output, but  they  may
     be used whenever it is necessary to specify a variable.


example:

     which command?  name
     var  1? iq
     var  2? test1
     var  3? test2
     var  4? test3
     var  5? test4

command:  1wayr
---------------

purpose:  calculate  one  way  analysis  of  variance  with   repeated
     measures.


reference:  "statistical principles in  experimental  design",  winer,
     pages 105-113.


description:  the "1wayr" command allows the user to calculate  a  one
     way   analysis   of   variance   with  repeated  measures.   when
     instructed, the user lists the variables separated by commas  for
     which  he  wishes to have an analysis of variance calculated.  up
     to 50 variables may be entered, using either variable  names  (if
     names   have  been  defined)  or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of
     variables may be entered by typing  the  extremes  of  the  range
     separated by a "-".

          one or more "*" may be used when listing the variables to be
     analyzed.   one  at a time each variable not yet specified in the
     analysis will be substituted for every "*".   those  cases  where
     the same variable would be listed twice in the same analysis will
     be eliminated, as will be those cases which, except for a  switch
     in  the  order  of  the  variables, duplicate an analysis already
     performed.

          output will be labeled with variable  names,  if  available;
     otherwise,  variable  numbers  will be used.  output size will be
     adjusted to fully utilize space available.


example:

     which command?  1wayr

command:  pcent
---------------


purpose:  calculate user specified percentiles


reference:  "basic statistics", downe and heath, pages 36,37.


description:  the  "pcent"  command  allows  the  user  to   calculate
     selected  percentiles  for one or more variables.  when prompted,
     the user lists the variables separated by commas  for  which  the
     percentiles  are  to  be  calculated.   up to 20 variables may be
     entered using either the  variable  names  (if  names  have  been
     defined)  or  variable  numbers.   ranges  of  variables  may  be
     indicated by typing the extremes of the range separated by a "-".
     where  percentiles  are to be calculated for all variables, a "*"
     must be substituted for variable names and numbers.

          the user will then be instructed to list the percentiles  he
     wishes  to  have  calculated  separated  by  commas.   up  to  20
     percentiles may be entered.  if either the deciles  (10th,  20th,
     30th,...80th,  90th  percentiles)  or  quartiles (25th, 50th, and
     75th percentiles) are desired, they may be obtained by responding
     with "dec" for the deciles or "qtr" for the quartiles.

command:  pcorr
---------------


purpose:  calculate partial correlations


reference:  "an introduction to  multivariate  statistical  analysis",
     t.w.  anderson, pages 31-32, 86-87.


description:  the "pcorr" command  allows  the  user  to  calculate  a
     partial   correlation   matrix  for  specified  variables.   when
     instructed, the user enters the variables  separated  by  commas,
     for  which  partial  correlations are to be calculated.  up to 20
     variables may be entered, using either variable names  (if  names
     have  been defined) or variable numbers.  ranges of variables may
     be entered by listing the extremes of the range  separated  by  a
     "-".   one  or more "*" may be used when listing the variables to
     be analyzed.  one at a time each variable not  yet  specified  in
     the  analysis  will  be  substituted  for every "*".  those cases
     where the same  variable  would  be  listed  twice  in  the  same
     analysis  will  be eliminated, as will be those cases that except
     for a switch in the order of the variables, duplicate an analysis
     already performed.

          output will be labeled with variable  names,  if  available;
     otherwise,  variable  numbers  will be used.  output size will be
     adjusted to fully utilize space available.

command:  plot
--------------


purpose:  produce bivariate scatter plot


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, pages 79-82.


description:  the  "plot"  command  allows  the  user  to  produce   a
     bivariate  (two  variable)  scatter  plot.   scatter plots may be
     produced for the following:

          (1)  a single variable vs a single variable
          (2)  a single variable vs all other variables
          (3)  all variables vs all variables

          it will be necessary  for  the  user  to  supply  first  the
     horizontal  and  then  the vertical axes.  either variables names
     (if names have been defined) or variable  numbers  may  be  used.
     where  all  variables are to be used a "*" may be substituted for
     variable names or numbers.  the plot is automatically  scaled  in
     both  the  horizontal  and  vertical  directions, and its size is
     adjusted to utilize space available.

          the digits 1 through 9 indicate the number  of  observations
     occupying  a  single  point in the graph.  letters (a-z) are used
     when more than 9 observations occupy the same location,  starting
     with  a  to indicate 10 numbers, b to indicate 11, etc., and z to
     indicate 35.  if more than 35 observations occupy a single  point
     a "*" will be used.


example: 

     which command?  plot

     which is the horizontal variable?  height

     which is the vertical variable?  weight

command:  print
---------------


purpose:  print selected variables on the line printer.


description:  the "print" command is used to obtain a copy of the data
     listed  on  the line printer.  when asked for the variables to be
     printed, the user types the variables on one  line  separated  by
     commas.  variables may be entered using either variable names (if
     names  have  been  defined)  or  variable  numbers.   ranges   of
     variables  may  be specified by listing the extremes of the range
     separated by a "-".  where all variables are to be printed, use a
     "*"  instead  of  variable names or numbers.  output is always to
     the line printer with multiple  copies  available  by  using  the
     "copys"  command  prior to the "print" command.  printouts may be
     picked up at the output window in the computer center, by  asking
     for  the printout and giving the users project-programmer number.
     the computer center is located on the third floor of  rood  hall.
     the  "type"  command  is  also  available  for  copies of data in
     smaller quantities, via the terminal.


example:

     which command?  print
     which variables?  sex,age,3,5-6

command:  prob
--------------


purpose:  calculate probabilities associated with t  tests,  f  tests,
     and chi squares.


description:  the  "prob"  command  allows  the  user   to   calculate
     probabilities  associated with t tests, f tests, and chi squares.
     to indicate to the user that an instruction should be inserted, a
     "?"  will  be  typed  out.   this  will be the first reply to the
     "prob"  command,  and  will   appear   after   each   probability
     calculated.  instructions may be entered in either of two ways:

     (1)  a code indicating the type of probability desired (the  user
          will  be  prompted  for  additional information).  the codes
          are:
               chi--chi square
               t----t test
               f----f test

     (2)  the code  and  information  are  entered  in  one  line  (no
          prompting  except for "?" is necessary here).  the codes and
          information are entered in the  following  manner,  with  no
          spaces between any characters:

          chi square
          ----------
               chi##,df
                    the three character code  "chi"  followed  by  the
                    value  of  the  chi  square  (the  chi  square  is
                    substituted for the "##"  in  the  above  string).
                    this  is  followed  by  a  comma, and finally, the
                    degrees of freedom (degrees of freedom substituted
                    for "df".)

          t test
          ------
               t##,df
                    the single character  code  "t"  followed  by  the
                    value  of  the t score (the t score is substituted
                    for the  "##"  in  the  above  string).   this  is
                    followed  by  a  comma, and finally the degrees of
                    freedom (degrees of freedom substituted for "df").

          f tests
          -------
               f##,ndf,ddf
                    the single character  code  "f"  followed  by  the
                    value  of the f score (f score substituted for the
                    "##" in the above string).  next a comma, and then
                    the  degrees  of freedom in the numerator (degrees

                    of freedom in the numerator will replace the "ndf"
                    in  above  string).   finally, a comma followed by
                    the degrees of freedom in the denominator (degrees
                    of  freedom  in  the  denominator will replace the
                    "ddf" in above line).

          included in the output will be a statement of the parameters
     supplied  as  well  as  the  probabilities  calculated.  both the
     one-tailed and two-tailed probabilities will  be  calculated  for
     the  t  tests.   to  return  to "which command?" enter an "exit",
     <cr>, or ^z(control z).

command:  ptbis
---------------


purpose:  calculate point biserial correlations


reference: "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, pages 169-172


description:  the "ptbis" command allows the user to  calculate  point
     biserial  correlations.  when requested, the user enters up to 20
     variables separated by  commas.   variable  numbers  or  variable
     names  (if  names  have  been  defined)  may  be used.  ranges of
     variables may be specified by typing the extremes  of  the  range
     separated by a "-".

          the user will next be instructed to  enter  the  dichotomous
     variable.   either the variable number or variable name (if names
     have been defined) may be used.  if more  than  2  unique  values
     exist,  it will also be necessary to specify a breakpoint for the
     dichotomous variable.  all values  less  than  or  equal  to  the
     breakpoint  will be treated as one portion of dichotomy while all
     values greater than the breakpoint will  be  the  other  portion.
     when instructed the user enters a value for the breakpoint, or if
     the median is to be  used  as  the  breakpoint  "median"  may  be
     specified.

command:  regr
--------------


purpose:  produce multiple regressions


reference:  "statistical methods", snedecor and cochran, pages 381-418


description:  the "regr" command allows the user to  produce  multiple
     regression  on  selected  variables.   when  instructed, the user
     enters the option desired.  only one option exists for the "regr"
     command.  it is:

                  "resid"--store residuals

          if this option is not to be used, type a <cr>.

          if the "resid" option has been specified the  user  will  be
     asked  to  indicate  under which variable the residuals are to be
     stored.  the variable name (if the name already  exists)  or  the
     variable  number  may be used in storing the residuals.  once the
     residuals have been stored in the  variable,  the  variable  name
     will be changed to "resid".

          the  user  will  be  instructed  to  list  the   independent
     variables  separated by commas.  up to 19 variables may be listed
     by variable names  (if  names  have  been  defined)  or  variable
     numbers.   ranges  of  variables  may  be indicated by typing the
     extremes of the range separated by a "-".  one or more "*" may be
     used when listing the variables.  one at a time each variable not
     yet specified in the analysis will be substituted for every  "*".
     those  cases where the same variable would be listed twice in the
     same analysis will be  eliminated,  as  will  those  cases  which
     except  for  a  change  in  the  order of variables, duplicate an
     analysis already performed.

          finally, the user will  be  asked  to  enter  the  dependent
     variable.   either the variable name (if names have been used) or
     the  variable  number  may  be  used.   if  the  user  wishes  to
     substitute  in one at a time all those variables not specified as
     independent, he may respond with a "*".  the "*" may be used both
     as  the  dependent  variable,  and  as  one  or  more independent
     variables in the same analysis.

command:  sort
--------------


purpose:  allow user to sort data into ascending order


description:  data may be sorted into ascending order by  use  of  the
     "sort"  command.   when  instructed  to enter sort keys, the user
     types in up to 20 variables separated by commas.  variable  names
     (if  names  have  been  given)  or  variable numbers may be used.
     ranges of variables may be specified by typing  the  extremes  of
     the  range  separated by a "-".  the sort fields should be listed
     from major to minor.  when the  sort  has  been  completed,  each
     observation  will  remain  unaltered, only the order in which the
     observations occur will have been changed.  the  major  sort  key
     (first  variable  in  the list) is used to determine which of two
     observations is first.  if no decision can be made as in the case
     of  a  tie,  the  next variable in the list of sort keys is used.
     the sort  proceeds  in  this  manner  always  checking  the  next
     variable  in  the  list, until it reaches the minor sort key (the
     last variable in the list).  if no decision can yet be made, they
     are left in the same order as they occur.


example:

     which command?  sort

     list sort variables major to minor?  1-3

purpose:  produce spearman rank-order correlations


reference:  "non-parametric statistics", siegel, pages 202-213


description:  the  "srank"  command  allows  the  user  to   calculate
     spearman  rank-order  correlations  between all variables.  after
     the command is given no other responses are necessary.

command:  stepr
---------------


purpose:  produce stepwise regressions


reference:  "mathematical methods for digital computers", ralston  and
     wilf, pages 191-203.


description:  the "stepr" command allows the user to produce  stepwise
     regressions  for  selected  variables.  when instructed, the user
     enters the desired options separated by commas.  

          possible options to "stepr" are:

          "anova"--analysis of variance
          "durwt"--durbin-watson test for autocorrelation
          "f-val"--indicate  f  values  for  entering  or  omitting  a
               variable
          "force"--indicate variables to be forced into regression
          "resid"--store residuals
          "toler"--indicate a tolerance other than .0001


          if no options are desired, type a <cr>.

          if the user has specified the  "toler"  option  he  will  be
     asked  to  enter  a tolerance.  the normally assumed tolerance is
     .0001.

          if "f-val" option was specified, the user will be instructed
     to supply the f-value for omitting a variable.

          the "resid" option, if used, will cause the residuals to  be
     stored  as  a  variable.   when  asked  under  which variable the
     residuals should be stored, the user  responds  with  a  variable
     name (the variable name must already exist) or a variable number.
     once the residuals are stored the name of the variable containing
     the residuals will automatically be changed to "resid".

          the user will now be  instructed  to  list  the  independent
     variables  separated  by  commas  for  analysis  by  the stepwise
     regression.  up to 19 variables may be listed by  variable  names
     (if  names  have  been  defined)  or variable numbers.  ranges of
     variables may be indicated by typing the extremes of  the  ranges
     separated by a "-".  one or more "*" may be used when listing the
     variables to be analyzed.  one at a time each  variable  not  yet
     specified  in  the  analysis  will  be substituted for every "*".
     those cases where the same variable would be listed twice in  the
     same  analysis  will be eliminated, as will be those cases which,
     except for a change in the order of the variables,  duplicate  an

statpack v4                                         PAGE  97



     analysis already performed.

          the user will now be asked to enter the dependent  variable,
     either  the  variable  name  (if  names have been defined) or the
     variable number may be used.  if the user wishes to substitute in
     one  at  a time all those variables not specified as independent,
     he may respond with a "*".  the "*"  may  be  used  both  as  the
     dependent  variable  and  as one or more independent variables in
     the same analysis.

          if the  user  specified  the  "force"  option,  he  will  be
     instructed  to  enter  those variables, separated by commas to be
     forced into the stepwise regression.  variables to be forced into
     the  regression may be entered by either variable names (if names
     have been defined) or variable numbers.  only variables specified
     as independent may be forced into the stepwise regression.

command:  stop
--------------


purpose:  restart stat pack, alter data size


description:  the "stop" command allows the user to restart a  run  of
     stat  pack.   once  the command is given, no additional responses
     are necessary.

          all files except those created with a "store"  command  will
     be destroyed.  output which has been assigned to the line printer
     but has not been printed, will remain unchanged, and any  further
     output  assigned  to  the printer will be added.  when the "fini"
     command is given all output to that point will be printed.   data
     which has been entered for analysis will have to be re-entered.

          the user will be given the opportunity to restate the limits
     for  his data when the "stop" command is used.  it is possible to
     increase, decrease, or leave  unchanged  the  assumed  data  set;
     however, the size is still subject to the original limitations.


example:

     which command?  stop

     maximum number of observations?

command:  store
---------------


purpose:   store data on disk


limitations:  data stored as floating point numbers,  with  no  option
     available to alter output format.


description:  the "store" command allows the user  to  store  selected
     variables  on the disk under his own area.  when the file name is
     requested, the user types in up to a six character name,  and  up
     to  a  three character extension separated by a period.  next the
     user will be asked for the variables to be stored.   to  indicate
     the variables, list either the variable names (if names have been
     defined) or the variable numbers on one line separated by commas.
     ranges  of  variables  may be indicated by typing the extremes of
     the range separated by a "-".  if all the  variables  are  to  be
     stored,  a  "*"  may  be used.  a standard protection code of 177
     will be assigned to the file unless otherwise  specified  by  the
     user.  data will be stored according to the format (8g15.7).


example:

     which command?  store
     what is the name of the file?  song.dat
     which variables?  1,3-5
     selected variables were stored according to format:
     (8g15.7)
     what protection would you like?  177

command:  title
---------------


purpose:  label output


limitation:  the title is limited to one line of 72 characters.


description:  the "title" command allows the user to label output with
     a  line  of identification.  when instructed, the user types in a
     label of up to 72 characters.  once the "title" command has  been
     issued,  the  output  from  each  command  will be labeled.  only
     another "title" command can modify a header already entered.


example:

     which command?  title

     type in the line of identification
     data used is random and not meant for conclusions

     which command?  desc

command:  trans
---------------


purpose:   create or modify variables  by  combining  or  transforming
     existing variables.


description:  instructions for transforming variables  are  structured
     in  the same manner as a fortran arithmetic statement.  the basic
     form of each instruction is:  the  variable  to  be  modified  or
     created,  a  "=",  and  the expression to be evaluated.  for each
     observation in the data set, the expression to the right  of  the
     "=" is evaluated and its final value is placed in the variable to
     the left of the "=".  the rules governing the evaluation  of  the
     expression  are  the  same  as  for  fortran.  the order in which
     operations are executed (hierarchy) is as follows:

          order       sign          explanation of sign
          -----       ----          -------------------
            1         **            exponent
            2         *             multiply
            2         /             divide
            3         +             add
            3         -             subtract


          operations which  have  the  same  order  of  execution  are
     evaluated  as  they are encountered proceeding from left to right
     through the expression.  parentheses  inside  an  expression  are
     evaluated   first,   beginning   with   the  innermost.   several
     predefined   functions   are   available   for   use    in    the
     transformations.  they are:

                    "abs"  - absolute value
                    "arcsn"- arc sin
                    "arctn"- arc tangent
                    "cos"  - cosine
                    "exp"  - exponential (e to the x)
                    "ln"   - natural log
                    "log10"- log base 10
                    "mean" - mean of variable
                    "norm" - normal random number generator
                    "ran"  - random number generator (.0-1.)
                    "sin"  - sin
                    "sqrt" - square root
                    "std"  - standard deviation of variable


          functions  are  evaluated  on  an  equal   priority   within
     parentheses.   they are used by typing the abbreviation, and then
     the  number  or  expression  to   be   evaluated,   enclosed   in
     parentheses.

          the "trans"  command  also  allows  a  form  of  conditional
     statement,  for  which  four  comparisons  to zero are available.
     these are:

                    "ifl" - if less than zero
                    "ife" - if equal to zero
                    "ifn" - if not equal to zero
                    "ifg" - if greater than zero


          conditional  statements  are  written  in  three  parts:   a
     condition to be satisfied, indicated by the three-character code;
     an  expression  enclosed  in  parentheses  to  be  evaluated  and
     compared  against  zero; and the transformation to be executed if
     the  conditional  is  satisfied.   for  each   observation,   the
     expression  enclosed  in  parentheses is evaluated; if it has the
     relationship to zero  indicated  by  the  conditional  code,  the
     transformation  is done for that observation.  if the conditional
     code  is  not  satisfied,  no  action  is  taken  and  the   next
     observation is considered.

          when issuing instructions to "trans", variable names may  be
     used or the variable numbers preceded by a "#".


examples:

     ? total=pts1+pts2+pts3
                                   the variable: total is  created  or
                                   modified  by  adding the variables:
                                   pts1, pts2, and pts3  together  and
                                   placing the final value in total.

     ? avgpt=(pts1+pts2+pts3)/3.
                                   the variable: avgpt is  created  or
                                   modified  by  adding the variables:
                                   pts1, pts2, pts3 together, dividing
                                   the  sum by 3 and placing the final
                                   answer in avgpt.

     ? iq=mtage/pyage
                                   the variable:  iq  is  modified  or
                                   created  by  dividing the variable:
                                   mtage by the  variable:  pyage  and
                                   placing the answer in iq.

     ? z=(weigh-mean(weigh))/std(weigh)
                                   the  variable:  z  is  created   or
                                   transformed by subtracting the mean
                                   of   variable:   weigh   from   the
                                   variable:  weigh  and dividing that
                                   value by the standard deviation  of
                                   the variable: weigh.

     ? log3=ln(#3)
                                   create or modify the variable: log3
                                   by   taking   the  natural  log  of
                                   variable number: 3.

     ? exp=3.14*sex+2.2*weigh+22.
                                   create or modify the variable:  exp
                                   by  placing the value of 3.14 times
                                   the variable: sex  plus  2.2  times
                                   the  variable:  weigh  plus 22 into
                                   the variable: exp.

     ? ifl(age-24) group=1
                                   create  or  modify  the   variable:
                                   group  by  checking  the  variable:
                                   age.  if the value of variable  age
                                   minus 24 is less than 0, put a 1 in
                                   variable:  group;  otherwise  leave
                                   group unchanged.

command:  ttest
---------------


purpose:  calculate t tests (significant difference between means)


reference:  "statistical methods", snedecor and cochran, pages 104-106


description:  the "ttest" command allows the user to calculate t tests
     (significant  difference  between  means).   when instructed, the
     user lists the options he desires separated by commas.   possible
     options are:

     "headr"--suppress initial portion of report, that part containing
          means and standard deviations for each sample.

     "probs"--output probability (two-tailed) associated with t tests.

     "break"--select samples from one variable based on the value of a
          second  variable.   for  each  observation, the value of the
          second  variable  (breakdown  variable)  will  be  used   to
          determine  in  which  sample  the  value  of  variable being
          analyzed belongs.  this is accomplished by determining which
          of  a  series  of ranges the value of the breakdown variable
          fits into, and then moving the value of analysis variable to
          the  corresponding  sample.   (if  this  option is not used,
          ttest will be calculated between variables.)

       note:  the following options are used only if "break" has  been
          used.

     "discr"--automatic  breakdown.   instead  of  the  user  entering
          ranges,  a  separate range will be created automatically for
          each value in the breakdown variable.

     "auto"--automatic breakdown.  this option  is  the  same  as  the
          "discr" option.  do not enter "auto" with the other options,
          it should be entered only when asked to enter the ranges.

       note:  the following option  is  only  available  if  automatic
          breakdowns are to be used.

     "range"--list the ranges to be used for the automatic breakdown.


          if the "break" option has not been specified, t  tests  will
     be  calculated between all possible pairs of variables.  no other
     user responses will be necessary in this case.

          if the "break" option has been used, it  will  be  necessary
     for the user to supply the following information:

statpack v4                                         PAGE 107



     (1)  the variables for which t tests are to be calculated (up  to
          20).   the  samples for each set of t tests will be selected
          from a single  variable.   variables  may  be  listed  using
          either  variable  names  (if  names  have  been  defined) or
          variable numbers.  ranges of variables may be  specified  by
          listing the extremes of the range separated by a "-".  where
          t tests are to be calculated for all variables, a "*" may be
          used instead of variable names or numbers.

     (2)  the variable to  be  used  for  the  breakdowns.   only  one
          variable  may  be  used,  it may be identified by either the
          variable name (if name has been defined) or variable number.
          all  of  the variables listed for analysis will be processed
          using the same breakdown variable.

     (3)  ranges for the breakdown variable.  if  the  "discr"  option
          has  been  used,  this  information  will  be  automatically
          calculated, and need not be supplied by the  user.   if  the
          "discr" option has not been used, the user may still request
          the ranges to be automatically calculated by responding with
          "auto".  to enter ranges, the user types the extremes of the
          range, smallest first, separated by a comma.  only one range
          may  be  entered  per line.  up to 50 ranges may be entered.
          after the last range has been  entered,  the  user  types  a
          ^z(control z).

command:  type
--------------


purpose:   type selected variables on the terminal.


description:  the "type" command allows the user to  display  data  on
     the terminal.  when asked for the variables, the user responds by
     listing the desired variables on  a  line  separated  by  commas.
     variables  may  be  entered using either variable names (if names
     have been defined) or variable numbers.  ranges of variables  may
     be  specified by listing the extremes of the range separated by a
     "-".  where all variables are to be printed, use a "*" instead of
     variable names or numbers.  the "print" command is also available
     in cases where the output to the terminal would be excessive.


example:

     which command?  type
     which variable?  sex,age,3,5-6

command:  xtab
--------------


purpose:  produce cross tabs (output is in the form of ordered pairs)


description:  the "xtab" command allows the user to  tabulate  one  or
     more  cross  tabs.   the  user  will first be asked if he desires
     percentages, to which the response  must  be  a  "yes"  or  "no".
     cross tabs may be produced for the following:

          (1)  a single variable vs a single variable
          (2)  a single variable vs all other variables
          (3)  all variables vs all variables

          when instructed to enter the cross tabs, the user  lists  up
     to  20  cross  tabs  separated  by semicolons.  each cross tab is
     composed of two variables separated by a comma.  to indicate  the
     variables,  either variable names (if names have been defined) or
     variable numbers may be used.  where  all  variables  are  to  be
     used, a "*" may be substituted for the variable names or numbers.
     the results will be adjusted in size for output  to  terminal  or
     line  printer.   if  a tabled version of the cross tab is desired
     see the command "xtab*".

note: positive and negative numbers as well as multiple digit  numbers
     may be processed with this command.

command:  xtab*
---------------


purpose:  produce cross tabs (output is a cross tab table)


limitation:  output must be assigned  to  line  printer  (see  command
     "assign").


description:  the "xtab*" command allows the user to tabulate  one  or
     more  cross  tabs.   the  user  will first be asked if he desires
     percentages,to which the response must be a "yes" or "no".  cross
     tabs may be produced for the following:

          (1)  a single variable vs a single variable
          (2)  a single variable vs all other variables
          (3)  all variables vs all variables

          when instructed to enter the cross tabs, the user  lists  up
     to  20  cross  tabs  separated  by semicolons.  each cross tab is
     composed of two variables separated by a comma.  to indicate  the
     variables, either variables names (if names have been defined) or
     variable numbers may be used.  where  all  variables  are  to  be
     used, a "*" may be substituted for variable names or numbers.

          results will be in a tabled form only  if  output  has  been
     assigned  to  the  line printer.  if the "assign" command has not
     been used, the output will be in the form of ordered pairs.

note: positive and negative numbers as well as multiple digit  numbers
     may be processed with "xtab*".

command:  zscor
---------------


purpose:  calculate z-scores.


reference:  "basic statistical methods", downe and heath, pages 60-61.


description:  the  "zscor"  command  allows  the  user  to   calculate
     z-scores  for  one  or more variables.  when instructed, the user
     lists the variables separated by commas for which z-scores are to
     be  calculated.   up  to  40 variables may be listed using either
     variable names (if names have been defined) or variable  numbers.
     ranges  of variables may also be indicated by typing the extremes
     of the range separated by  a  "-".   where  z-scores  are  to  be
     calculated  for  all  variables, a "*" may be substituted for the
     variable names and numbers.  frequencies will be included in  the
     output for the user's convenience.
