A COPY OF EACH OF THESE BOOKS HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR:  (1) PHYSICAL SCIENCE
LIBRARY, (2) WALDO LIBRARY, AND (3) BUSINESS LIBRARY.
 
THE BIOMEDICAL PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO INPUT DATA FROM CARDS, DISK, OR
MAGNETIC TAPE.  THE OUTPUT IS DESIGNED FOR THE LINE PRINTER.  BECAUSE OF THIS,
THE PROGRAMS CAN BEST BE RUN FROM BATCH.
 
THE GENERAL CARD SETUP IS AS FOLLOWS:
 
     FOR DATA ON CARDS:
 
         $JOB [PROJ,PROG]
         $PASSWORD PSWD
         $DECK FILE.F4
         [AT THIS POINT ENTER FORTRAN CARDS.] #
         $DATA
         [AT THIS POINT ENTER ALL OTHER CARDS DESCRIBED IN THE
         BMD MANAUL EXCEPT SYSTEM CARDS.]  @
         $EOD
         $COPY BMD--- (THE SIX CHARACTERS FOLLOWING THE WORD "COPY" MUST
                       BE THE BMD PROGRAM NAME.)
         (EOF)
 
     FOR DATA ON A DISK FILE CALLED FILE.DAT:
 
         $JOB [PROJ,PROG]
         $PASSWORD PSWD
         .AS DSK  7
         .R PIP
         *FOR07.DAT  FILE.DAT   (WHERE FILE.DAT IS THE NAME OF THE DATA FILE)
         $DECK FILE.F4
         [AT THIS POINT ENTER FORTRAN CARDS.]  #
         $DATA
         [AT THIS POINT ENTER ALL OTHER CARDS DESCRIBED IN THE BMD MANUAL
         EXCEPT SYSTEM CARDS.  @ YOU MUST SPECIFY 7 AS AN AUXILIARY
         INPUT DEVICE NUMBER ON PROBLM CARD.]
         $EOD
         $COPY BMD--- (THE SIX CHARACTERS FOLLOWING THE WORD "COPY" MUST
                       BE THE BMD PROGRAM NAME.)
         (EOF)
 
     FOR DATA ON MAGNETIC TAPE:
 
         $JOB [PROJ,PROG]
         $PASSWORD PSWD
         .MOUNT MTA 7 /REE:---- (---- IS THE TAPE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER)
         $DECK FILE.F4
         [AT THIS POINT ENTER ALL OTHER CARDS DESCRIBED IN THE BMD MANUAL
         EXCEPT SYSTEM CARDS.  @ YOU MUST SPECIFY 7 AS AN AUXILIARY
         INPUT DEVICE NUMBER ON PROBLM CARD]
         $EOD
         $COPY BMD--- (THE SIX CHARACTERS FOLLOWING THE WORD "COPY" MUST
                       BE THE BMD PROGRAM NAME.)
         .DISMOUNT 7: /R
         (EOF)
 
 
@ A SYSTEM CARD IS ANY CARD WHICH BEGINS WITH //, /* OR $ID
# THESE CARDS AND THE "DECK" CARD ARE ONLY USED WITH BMDX77, BMDX85, BMDX94.
 
RUNNING BMD PROGRAMS WITHOUT USING CARDS
 
THE BMD INVOCATION SEQUENCE IS COMPLEX ENOUGH THAT BATCH ENTRY IS THE MOST
PRACTICAL APPROACH.  HOWEVER, ACCESS TO BATCH IS POSSIBLE FROM A TERMINAL,
WITHOUT THE USE OF PUNCHED CARDS, BY THE USE OF THE SUBMIT COMMAND.
 
THIS METHOD OF SUBMITTING A BATCH COMMAND FILE IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR DATA
STORED ON DISK.
 
PROCEDURE:
 
1)  MAKE A FILE CONTAINING THE PARAMETER STATEMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE BMD MANUAL,
EXCEPT SYSTEM STATEMENTS.  YOU MUST SPECIFY "7" AS AN AUXILIARY INPUT DEVICE
NUMBER ON THE PROBLM STATEMENT IF THE DATA IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PARAMETER
FILE.
 
2)  IF FORTRAN STATEMENTS ARE NEEDED, MAKE A FILE CALLED FILE.F4 CONTAINING
THESE STATEMENTS.
 
3)  IF YOUR DATA IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PARAMETER FILE, CREATE A FILE ON DISK
CONTAINING YOUR DATA.
 
4)  RUN THE PROGRAM BMDSMT TO CREATE THE CONTROL FILE NEEDED.
 
5)  TYPE:  SUBMIT BMD
 
6)  YOUR OUTPUT WILL GO TO THE LINE PRINTER.
 
EXAMPLE RUN
 
.R BMDSMT
 
ENTER NAME OF BMD PROGRAM (E.G. BMD01D)
 
BMDX72
 
ENTER NAME OF THE PARAMETER FILE
 
PRM.DAT
 
ENTER THE NAME OF YOUR DATA FILE
JUST ENTER A <CR> IF DATA IS INCLUDED IN PARAMETER FILE
 
INPUT.DAT
 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO "SUBMIT BMD"
 
END OF EXECUTION
CPU TIME:  0.55  ELAPSED TIME:  31.33
EXIT
 
.SUBMIT BMD
 
.
 
NOTE:
 
1)  THE NORMAL TIME ALLOWED FOR THE PROCESSING OF A BATCH JOB, (SUBMITTED OR
WITH CARDS) IS 3 MINUTES.  IF THE JOB IS LARGE YOU MAY WISH TO INCREASE THIS.
THE COMMAND TO INCREASE THE TIME OF THE ABOVE JOB TO 6 MINUTES WOULD BE:
SUBMIT BMD/TIME:6:00.
 
2)  IF YOU WISH TO DEFER THE START OF A JOB TO A DIFFERENT TIME OF DAY,
PERHAPS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LIGHTER SYSTEM LOAD OR CHEAPER RATES, YOU MAY
USE THE /AFTER SWITCH.  SUPPOSE YOU WISH TO DEFER THE START OF THE JOB
13-1/2 HOURS, YOU COULD SUBMIT THE JOB LIKE THIS:  SUBMIT BMD/AFTER:+13:30.
 
3)  BOTH SWITCHES MAY BE USED IF DESIRED OR YOU MAY USE ANY OF THE SWITCHES
LISTED IN THE BATCH SYSTEM COMMANDS SECTION OF THE DECSYSTEM-10 USERS HAND-
BOOK.
 
THE PDP-10 VERSION OF THE BIOMEDICAL PROGRAMS ARE LIMITED IN PROBLEM SIZE
BY THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE BMD MANUALS.  IN ADDITION TO THESE RESTRIC-
TIONS, THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS APPLY:
 
     I.  IN EACH OF THE BIOMEDICAL PROGRAMS, A BLANK IS READ IN AS A ZERO. THIS
         IS TRUE IN SPITE OF WHAT MAY BE SAID ABOUT THIS IN THE BMD MANUAL.
 
    II.  WHENEVER PUNCHED CARD OUTPUT IS EXPECTED,
         1.  INSERT AN ADDITIONAL CARD BEFORE THE $COPY CARD WHICH CONTAINS:
             .MOUNT CDP PTP /FORMS:XXX
             "XXX" SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF CARDS
             TO BE PUNCHED.
