DUMPER.DOC -- Changes from V4(303) to V4.1(402)
June 1983



1.0  SUMMARY

DUMPER is a program for saving and restoring disk files using magtape.
It  is  used  by operations personnel for file system maintenance, and
may be employed by users who wish to keep  certain  files  on  magtape
and/or transfer them between systems.

DUMPER version 4.1(402)  runs  on  TOPS-20  Release  4.1  and  TOPS-20
Release 5.

DUMPER does not require any other software modules during execution.

DUMPER is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide, and some  privileged
functions are described in the Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

File archiving, migration, retrieval, and collection support has  been
added  and  enhanced.   File  collection  is  supported  only with the
advanced archiving features of the V5 EXEC.

The interface to TOPS-20 using tape-drive allocation has  been  added.
Volume  identifiers are included in the listing when saving files on a
system using tape-drive allocation.

The SET  BLOCKING-FACTOR  command  was  added  to  achieve  a  greater
percentage of tape utilization.

The UNLOAD command was added for use  on  systems  without  tape-drive
allocation.

The INCREMENTAL feature of the SAVE command has been enhanced.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  Reverse SKIPs in interchange mode do not work.

     2.  If there are  any  read  errors  or  duplicate  records,  the
         CHECKSUM given by the PRINT command is not valid.

     3.  The /COLLECTION switch of the SAVE command  requires  support
         provided by the V5 EXEC.

4.1  Files Needed to Run DUMPER

DUMPER.EXE is the only file needed for DUMPER execution.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing DUMPER

DUMPER is loaded in SYS:  as part of the installation procedure.   New
versions may be put into use by copying the DUMPER.EXE file onto SYS:.


4.3  Files Needed to Build DUMPER

DUMPER is built from the following files:

     DUMPER.MAC
     ARMAIL.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACREL.REL
     MONSYM.UNV
     MACSYM.UNV
     QSRMAC.UNV
     GLXMAC.UNV
     ACTSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building DUMPER

SUBMIT DUMPER.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


4.5  Special Considerations

DUMPER is used during the initial phases of  system  installation  and
file structure refreshing.  For this reason, it is advisable to have a
copy of DUMPER on one or more magtapes.  DUMPER may be put on  magtape
by:

     @ASSIGN MTAn:                      ! assign and mount blank tape
     @REWIND MTAn:                      ! put DUMPER at beginning
     @COPY SYS:DUMPER.EXE (TO) MTAn:    ! copy to tape

DUMPER may be loaded and run directly from a magtape generated in this
way.

DUMPER is intended to perform a number of  privileged  functions  when
run  by  operations  personnel,  and its behavior is modified slightly
when running with WHEEL or  OPERATOR  capabilities  enabled.   Consult
User's and Operator's Guides for additional information.

DUMPER needs to be rebuilt with the currently running GALAXY  modules.
If  this  is not done, then DUMPER may not be able to communicate with
QUASAR which will break the file retrieval mechanism.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES


5.1  Changes from DUMPER 4(303) to DUMPER 4.1(402)

Usage Accounting record types 15,16,17 and 18 have had the information
in all the fields fixed.

The Control-E abort recovery has been cleaned up.

IPCF communications with GALAXY has been enhanced.   The  IPCF  quotas
for DUMPER have been changed from infinity to 30 as not to take up all
the monitor freespace if DUMPER has been Control-C from the  retrieval
function.   The  message handling has been changed so that DUMPER will
DEBRK only when it has an empty message queue.

The statistics at the end of saveset giving the number of files  saved
and the number of pages saved has been fixed.

Error messages that require an answer from the user have been prefixed
with a "$" so that these messages will surface in a batch stream.

The control-A character will now type out a status report telling  the
user  what  file  DUMPER  is  currently  looking at as well as whether
DUMPER is restoring, saving or just looking at the file.

The disk quota exceeded recovery has been corrected.

For further changes see the Edit History.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

DUMPER MUST be rebuilt with the current version of  QSRMAC  from  your
sites  GALAXY system.  This will guarantee that DUMPER and QUASAR have
the same set of symbols for the retrieval function.
