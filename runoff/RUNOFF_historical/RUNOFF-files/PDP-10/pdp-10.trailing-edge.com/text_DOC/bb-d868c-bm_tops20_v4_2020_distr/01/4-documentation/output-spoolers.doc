SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

This document describes the changes in the output  device  spoolers  for
release 4 of the TOPS20 spooling subsystem.


                                  NOTE

               This is one of 5 documentation files  that
               exist for the batch and spooling software.
               Refer to the GAL4.DOC file for an overview
               of this release.


This document primarily discusses the following programs:

     1.  LPTSPL.EXE

     2.  SPROUT.EXE

In the area of output device driving and output spooling, release  4  is
primarily  concerned  with  performance  issues.   There are, however, a
significant number of functional enhancements and a few changes.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Changes Applicable To The System Operator

     1.  The most significant change involving the system  operators  is
         that  the  operator no longer types commands directly to LPTSPL
         or  SPROUT.   For  Release-4,  A  new  Operator  Interface  was
         developed  and  it  is through this interface that the operator
         controls all batch and output spooling processors.




2.2  Changes Applicable To All Output Device Users

     1.  Each job placed in the output queue by a PRINT, PUNCH  or  PLOT
         command gets a unique identifier called a 'request-id' assigned
         to it.  This request-id, unlike the existing 'sequence' number,
         uniquely  identifies  the queue request.  The request-id may be
         used on the CANCEL and MODIFY commands and they appear  in  the
         queue  listing  rather  than  the  sequence  number.  Note that
         request-ids are reassigned whenever the system is restarted and
         therefore they should never be built into automated procedures.
         A sequence number may still be assigned to each job by the user
         and may be used for automated procedures.  Sequence numbers are
         displayed in the queue listing if the /ALL option is requested.

     2.  The maximum allowable value on the /PRIORITY switch is  now  20
         rather than 62.

     3.  The /DESTINATION-NODE:  switch may be used to  route  files  to
         remote  stations.   This  switch is valid only for Line Printer
         output.  Remote station devices other then the Line Printer are
         not supported in Release-4.

     4.  A new switch called /NOTIFY may  be  used  on  PRINT/PUNCH/PLOT
         commands.   If this switch is given, the system will notify the
         user at his  terminal  when  his  PRINT/PUNCH/PLOT  request  is
         complete.

     5.  The /ACCOUNT switch may be used to specify an account string to
         be  used for billing.  If one is not specified, it is defaulted
         to the users logged in account string.

     6.  The /UNIT:  switch may be specified to direct the users  output
         to a specific output device.

     7.  The /GENERIC switch may be user to specify that the request  be
         printed/plotted/punched on any available printer/plotter/punch.

KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

Remote station spooling to output devices other then the line printer is
not supported in Release-4.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

4.1  Files Needed To Drive Printers, Card & Paper-Tape Punches And Plotters 

Given a running release 4 TOPS20 system with QUASAR, ORION, and OPR,  an
installation  requires  SPROUT.EXE  and LPTSPL.EXE in order to drive the
Line Printers, Card & Paper-Tape Punches, and Plotters.



4.2  Instructions For Installing Output Device Driving Programs

SPROUT.EXE and LPTSPL.EXE are all supplied on the SYS area of the TOPS20
release   tape   and  will  be  installed  automatically  during  system
installation.



4.3  Files Needed To Build Output Device Spoolers 

Normally, any change to the GALAXY subsystem will be include running the
GALGEN program to generate a new GALCNF.MAC configuration file.



4.4  Instructions For Building Output Device Spoolers 

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Release 4 contains a number of changes to virtually  all  components  of
the batch and spooling subsystem.  These common changes include:

     1.  Full conversion of all programs to run in 'native' mode on both
         the TOPS10 and TOPS20 operating systems.  (Note:  some programs
         like LPTSPL already ran in native mode on both systems).

     2.  Use of the GALAXY runtime library by all components.

     3.  Removal  of  explicit  operator  interfaces  in  all   relevant
         programs and inclusion of an OPR/ORION interface.

     4.  Increased modularization of many programs.

In addition to  these  changes,  The  Output  Device  Spoolers  had  the
following internal changes:

INTERNAL CHANGES


     1.  LPTSPL will drive  any  type  of  supported  local/remote  line
         printer.   This includes THE DN60/5 (IBM Remote) in termination
         mode and the DN200 remote station.

     2.  Spooling to Mag tape support has been added to LPTSPL.

     3.  LPTSPL now supports fast backspace.

     4.  LPTSPL Now supports the Align  function  for  Aligning  special
         forms.
