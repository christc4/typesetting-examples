MAIL.DOC -- Changes from V3(4) to V4(6)
January 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

MAIL is a program which allows users to send messages to other  users.
Messages  sent  by MAIL are stored in the receiver's disk directory so
that they may be referenced when convenient.

MAIL version 4(6) runs on Release 4 of TOPS-20.

MAIL depends on the programs INFO and MAILER  to  perform  its  stated
tasks.  Also, the program RDMAIL is used by message recepients to read
messages.

MAIL is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.

There are no external changes in MAIL for Release 4.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None as of 29-Jan-79.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run MAIL
