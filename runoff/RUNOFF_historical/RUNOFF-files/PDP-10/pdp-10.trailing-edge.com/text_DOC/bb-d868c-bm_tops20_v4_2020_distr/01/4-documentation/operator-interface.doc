1.0  SUMMARY


This  DOC  file  describes  the   new   Operator   Interface
components and some of the changes in GALAXY from Release 3.
The Operator Interface consists of the following programs:

     1.  ORION

     2.  OPR

ORION is the OPERATOR nucleus and can run detached or  under
SYSJOB  since  it  will  not accept terminal input or dispay
anything on its controlling terminal.  OPR  is  the  command
parser  and  contain  the  command language for GALAXY and a
number of other monitor functions and applications.  The new
Operator  Interface  for  Release  4  of GALAXY replaces the
existing command scanners  and  terminal  output  facilities
used by the following:

     1.  BATCON

     2.  SPRINT

     3.  LPTSPL

     4.  SPROUT

     5.  OPLEASE


This facility also includes command and output  support  for
the following:

     1.  CDRIVE -- new card reader driver

     2.  MOUNTR -- -20 mounting controller

     3.  QUASAR --  expanded  Show  commands   for   Status,
         Parameters, Routing,Mount Requests, and Queues

     4.  TOPS20 -- a number of Monitor  functions  including
         scheduler control


The Operator Interface also provides support for controlling
the  system  from  more  than  one  terminal/location.   The
Operator no longer has to be on  the  CTY  to  find  out  or
respond  to  SPOOLER  messages.   Any message coming for the
Operator requiring a  response  is  queued  up  and  can  be
answered in any order.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

All GALAXY components can run detached or under SYSJOB since
they  will  not  talk  to the Operator any more.  All PLEASE
output and responses are now handled  though  OPR/ORION  and
will queue up the requests and allow the Operator to respond
to them with the RESPOND command.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

4.1  Files Needed To Run OPR/ORION

The  Operator  Interface  requires  OPR.EXE,  ORION.EXE  and
GLXLIB.EXE  inorder  to  bring  up  the system.  Support for
NETCON is built into the default system and  therefore  just
requires  NETCON  inorder to run.  Any other applications to
be run buy OPR and ORION will require a GALAXY  build  using
GALGEN.
