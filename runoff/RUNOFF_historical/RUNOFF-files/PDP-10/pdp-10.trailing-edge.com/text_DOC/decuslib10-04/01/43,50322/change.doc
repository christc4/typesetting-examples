                       CHANGES TO THE UCILSP SYSTEM 9/73


                                    Summary


               Various  changes have  again  been made  to  the UCILSP
          system.   Among  these  are  a  plethora  of  new  functions
          particularly I/O  type functions,  access to  the  QMANGR to
          allow  spooling of output and batching of  jobs.   Also some
          common functions such as AND and  OR  have  been  changed so
          that they now return useful  values instead  of  T.  Several
          new symbol table functions have been added.  Internally, the
          I/O has  been  reorganized  which  will  make  it easier for
          future expansion and the bit-pushers.
               A new data  type has  been  added  using binary program
          space.   Multiple OBLISTs are  now possible using  this data
          type.   Note that the value  of the atom OBLIST is now truly
          the oblist.   The normal system OBLIST can be restored via a
          REE   when   at  the  monitor  level,   followed  by  an  ^R
          (CONTROL-R).   This  also  often  corrects  that  occasional
          problem of a GARBAGED OBLIST.  Try it and see.
               Various bugs and other problems have been  fixed.  Some
          common  illegal  memory  references  have  been  eliminated.
          Among others,  DSKOUT no longer clobbers the previously open
          channel and SUBST and COPY now work properly.  (They used to
          be clobbered by the garbage collector).

                            Changes to Old Functions

     AND OR MEMQ MEMBER

          These functions have been changed so that they return useful
          values as  did their  old counterparts  AND#, OR#, MEMQ# and
          MEMBER#.   The # functions are no longer  in the system, but
          are contained in a file called COMPAT.LSP.

     CONSP

          CONSP also returns a useful value, it's argument, if it is a
          cons cell and not an atom.

     DSKOUT

          DSKOUT  now attempts  to  back  up  the  file  if it already
          exists.


































                                   CHANGES . 2













                               New I/O Functions

               Various  functions  for   file   manipulation,  reading
          directories and queueing files have been added.

     RENAME *RENAME

          These  functions allow  the renaming of files.  RENAME is an
          FSUBR that does not evaluate it's arguments,  *RENAME is the
          SUBR version.

     DELETE

          DELETE is  an FSUBR  that deletes the files in it's argument
          list.  It ignores files that do not exist.

     LOOKUP

          LOOKUP checks to see if a file exists.  Handy in conjunction
          with the rename functions.

     FILBAK

          FILBAK renames a file to the specified extension.

     QUEUE

          QUEUE  is the  serves  the  same  functions  as  the monitor
          command of the  same name.  No longer do you have to destroy
          your core  image or go through the contortions  of detaching
          and QUEUEing to get a listing on the line printer.

     UFDINP

          UFDINP  opens  a  UFD  on the specified  channel for reading
          directories.

     RDFILE

          RDFILE reads the next entry from a UFD, i.e. the next file.

     DIR

          DIR returns a list of files in the specified directory.

     RDNAM

          RDNAM reads without interning.




                                   CHANGES . 3













                                 New Predicates


     NUMTYPE

          NUMTYPE returns FIXNUM or FLONUM  depending  on the  type of
          it's numeric argument.

     INUMP

          INUMP  returns  it's  argument if  it  is  an  INUM  and NIL
          otherwise.

                            Miscellaneous Functions

     ERRCH

          ERRCH changes the bell character that causes an  (ERR (QUOTE
          ERRORX)) when read.  Returns the ASCII representation of the
          old character.   Takes  the ASCII representation  of the new
          character as it's argument.

     INITFL The system now allows a list of files instead  of  the old
          INIT.LSP  only.   The  first  file  in  the  list  is always
          optional.   If any of the subsequent files are not found, an
          error is generated.

     *RPUTSYM RPUTSYM

          Analagous to *PUTSYM and PUTSYM except that  they  only take
          cons  cells  for the  values.   They store the values in the
          symbol  table with the  atom  relocation  stripped  off thus
          allowing BPS  to  be expanded without  clobbering  code that
          references free space.

     *RGETSYM RGETSYM

          Analoguos  to  *GETSYM  and  GETSYM  except  that  the  atom
          relocation is add back in before returning the value.

                                BLOCK Data Type

          This data type  is a  contiguous  block of storage in BINARY
          PROGRAM SPACE.   It's main usage is  for building lists that
          can also be referenced as tables.  All of the functions that
          work  on normal lists will also work on lists built in these
          BLOCKs.   All  of  these  functions  return  true  addresses
          pointing to the beginning of the BLOCK.

     GTBLK

          GTBLK returns a block of storage.   This block can either be
          considered a block  of pointers,  in  which case  it will be
          scanned by the garbage collector, or the user can use it for
          whatever his heart desires.

     BLKLST

          BLKLST maps a list into a BLOCK.   The CDR's of the BLOC are
          each successive word of the block.  The CARs are the CARs of
          the list given as one of it's arguments.
