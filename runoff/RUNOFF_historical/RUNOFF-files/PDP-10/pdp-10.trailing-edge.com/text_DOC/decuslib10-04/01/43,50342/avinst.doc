		NEXT, GIVE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS TO THE MONITOR:

	.COMPILE /F10 AVAIL,CSPMAN,AVCLNR

	.R FUDGE2
	*AVCLNR.REL=AVCLNR.REL,AVAIL.REL<AVSTOP>/A$
	*^C

	.LOAD /REL AVAIL,CSPMAN

	.SAVE AVAIL

	.LOAD /REL AVCLNR,CSPMAN

	.SAVE AVCLNR

		COPY FILES AVAIL.SAV, PROGMS.ALL, PROGMS.IDX,
	PROGMS.STP, AND AVAIL.HLP INTO THE AREA WHERE THEY WILL BE
