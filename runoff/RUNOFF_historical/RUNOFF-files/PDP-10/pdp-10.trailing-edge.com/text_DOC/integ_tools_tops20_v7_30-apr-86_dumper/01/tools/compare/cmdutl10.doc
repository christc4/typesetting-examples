TEN TO VAX UTILITY AND COMMAND COMPARISON
by Sandra Barry
Purchasing Data Center Software Support
 
 
This article compares the DECsystem-10 utilities to the VAX 
utilities.  It is intended to provide a quick reference for those 
who are going from a TEN to a VAX.  The information has been 
compiled from the VAX/VMS Software Notebooks.
 
The comparison is based on the DECsystem-10 1091 and the VAX/VMS 
Version 3.0.
 
I've taken the utilities on the TEN and in most cases found 
comparable utilities on the VAX.  A lot of my examples depict the 
simplest of cases.  These examples will give general ideas about 
the commands on which you may need additional "HELP."
 
For example, if on the TEN you want to run BACKUP, you issue the 
command "R BACKUP"; on the VAX you simply say "BACKUP".  The VAX 
does not make use of the "RUN" command for system utilities 
because this command is built into the DIGITAL Command Language 
(DCL).
 
I have listed, first, the TEN utilities and beside it a 
comparable VAX utility.  Examples of selected utilities and 
ocmmands are also listed.

GENERAL DIFERRENCES
 
WILD CARDS
 
The % sign on the VAX is used in the same way the ? is used on 
the TEN.  The * is used on the VAX as it is on the TEN.


FILE SPECIFICATIONS ON THE VAX
 
Node::device:[directory]filename.type;version (max size 128 
      characters)
 
Node 	-	Node enables you to access a file located at 
another node on the network.
 
Device 	-	See device format below.
 
Directory 	-	1 thru 9 alphanumeric character string or two-part 
octal number in the format of a User Identification 
code (UIC).
 
	- 	Eight levels of a sub directories (like SFD's on 
the ten).
 
Filename 	-	1 thru 9 alphanumeric characters.
 
Type	-	0 thru 3 alphanumeric character extension.
 
Version	-	On input, the system defaults to the highest 
version number of the file.  On output, the system 
adds 1 to the highest existing version number.
 
LOGGING INTO THE SYSTEM USING A DIALUP
 
1.	Dial up the VAX.
2.	Hit 2 carriage returns.
3.	The system will prompt you with - Username:
4.	Enter your Username and hit a carriage return.
5.	The system will prompt you with - Password:
6.	If the Username and Password were valid you will see a dollar 
    sign ($).
7.	If step 6 fails you will receive a "User authorization 
    failure" message and you may have to dial up the system 
    again.
 
DEVICE FORMAT
 
In all of the following examples of VAX utilties and commands, 
the legends are as follows:
 
Format - ddcu
dd  =  device type
c   =  controller designator
u   =  unit number
 
For example:  MTA1 = device type MT magtape, controller A, unit 
number 1.
 
MONITOR COMMAND LEVEL
 
Monitor command level on the TEN is a dot (.)
Monitor command level on the VAX is a dollar sign ($)


CONTROL CHARACTERS
 
Control-Y terminates execution on te VAX in the same way 
Control-C works on the TEN.
 
Control-S stops scrolling and Control-Q continues as on the the 
TEN.
 
Control-T displays a single line of statistical information.
 
Most of the other control functions work on the VAX as they do on 
the TEN.
 
COMPILING FORTRAN WITH THE DEBUGGER
 
$FORTRAN/DEBUG/NOOPTIMIZE TESTPROG
$LINK/DEBUS TESTPROG
$RUN TESTPROG
DBG>
 
SYSTEM DEFAULT LOGICAL NAMES
 
SYS$INPUT	-	Default "input" stream from which the system 
"reads" commands and your programs "read" data.  
Default interactive assignment = TT
			Default batch assignment = the command procedure of 
batch stream.
 
SYS$OUTPUT	-	Default "output" stream to which the system 
"writes" responses to commands and your program 
"writes" data.
			Default interactive assignment = TT.
			Default batch assignment = batch job log file.
 
SYS$ERROR	-	Default device to which the system writes all error 
and informational messages.
			Default interactive assignment = TT.
			Default batch assignment = batch job log file.
 
SYS$DISK	-	Default disk device.
			Default assignment = set in User Authorization 
File.
 
Within your program or at DCL level:
ASSIGN SYS$OUTPUT OUTFILE
 
So, when the program writes to the logical device OUTFILE and 
output is directed to the terminal.	


DETAILED EXPLANATION FOR SOME VAX UTILITIES AND COMMANDS	
	
NOTE:	In the following description, lines beginning with a:
 
	$ (dollar sign) signify user input.
	% (percent sign) signify system information responses
	- (dash) at the end of the line signifies a continuation
	  (underscore) at the beginning of the next line 
          signifies continuation of your command string.
 
CANCEL
 
$RUN/SCHEDULE = 14:00 STATUS
%RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 13012A
 
$CANCEL/identification = 13012A
 
The run command creates a process to execute the image 
STATUS.EXE.
 
The process hibernates, and is scheduled to be awakened at 14:00.  
Before the process is awakened, the CANCEL command cancels the 
wake-up request.
 
$RUN/process name = LIBRA/interval=1:00 LIBRA
%RUN-S-PROC_ID, idntification of created process is 130017
 
$CANCEL LIBRA
$STOP LIBRA
 
The run command creates a subprocess name LIBRA to execute the 
image LIBRA.EXE at hourly intervals.  Subsequently, the CANCEL 
command cancels the wake-up request.  The process continues to 
exist, but in the state of hibernation.  The STOP command deletes 
the subprocess.
 
COBOL
 
$COBOL/LIST/OBJECT = TEST A12
 
Source file A12.COB produces an object module; TEST.OBJ, and a 
source listing in the file A12.LIS.
 
$COBOL/C74 TRANSLATE/LIST
$LINK TRANSLATE, SYS$LIBRARY:C74LIB/LIBRARY
 
Compiles source TRANSLATE.COB and creates an object file named 
TRANSLATE.OBJ and a listing named TRANSLATE.LIS.
The LINK specifies the object file, TRANSLATE.OBJ and the 
COBOL-74 run-time library, C74LIB, that is located on the default 
system library device, needed to link all VAX-11 COBOL-74 images.


CONTINUE
 
Example of program running with a control-Y interruption.  The 
program will continue after you invoke the CONTINUE command.
 
$RUN MYPROG
 control-Y
$SHOW TIME
 16-JUN-1982 13:40:12	(system response)
$CONTINUE
..MYPROG continues
 
CONVERT
 
This utility copies records from one file to another, changing 
the organization and format of the input file to that of the 
output file. You can append to the end of the file or merge the 
records sequentially into an indexed file.
 
$CONVERT/NOCREATE/TRUNCATE/EXCEPTIONS_FILE=EXEFILE-_VARFILE.DAT 
FIXFILE.DAT
 
Copies records from a file with variable-length records 
(VARFILE.DAT) to a file with fixed-length records (FIXFILE.DAT).  
It truncates variable-length records that are longer than the 
fixed-length records in FIXFILE.DAT, and copies short records to 
the exceptions file EXFILE.EXE.
 
$CONVERT FILE.IDX FILE.IDX
 
Creates the output file FILE.IDX with a version number one higher 
than that of the input file.  The output file is a copy of the 
input file, but it is a clean copy; bucket splits and RRVs 
(Record Reference Vector) disappear, and pointers to deleted 
records are reclaimed.
 
CONVERT establishes new RFAs during such organization.
RFAs (Record File Address) are used to retrieve records in any 
file organzation as long as the file resides on a disk volume, 
this allows records previously accessed to be accessed randomly 
at a subsequent time.
 
COPY
 
$COPY TEST.DAT NEWTEST.DAT
 
Copies the contents of TEST.DAT into a file name NEWTEST.DAT if 
NEWTEST.DAT exists, the copy command creates a new version of 
NEWTEST.DAT.
 
$MOUNT MTA1: VOL25 TAPE:
$COPY TAPE:*.*  *

The COPY command uses the logical name TAPE for the input file 
specification requesting that all files on the magnetic tape be 
copies to the current default disk and directory.
All the files copies retain their file name and file types.
 
CREATE
 
This example shows two separate files being created with a 
control-Z terminating the input into each.
 
$CREATE A.DAT, B.DAT
..The rain in Spain falls
..mainly on the plain
Control Z (close A.DAT)
 
..one fish two fish
..red fish blue fish
Control Z (close B.DAT)
$
 
File A.DAT will contain "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the 
plain."  A separate file, B.DAT, will contain "One fish two fish 
red fish blue fish."
 
CREATE/DIRECTORY
 
$CREATE/DIRECTORY DMA2:[BARRY]
$CREATE/DIRECTORY [BARRY.SANDRA]
$SET DEFAULT [BARRY.SANDRA]
 
All files subsequently created are cataloged in [BARRY.SANDRA] 
This is a lot like the sub-file directories on the TEN.
 
DEBUG
 
$FORTRAN/DEBUG/NOOPTIMIZE WIDGET
$LINK/DEBUG WIDGET
%DEBUG-I-INITIAL, language is FORTRAN, module set to 
"WIDGET"
DBG>GO
 
The FORTRAN and LINK commands both specify the /DEBUG qualifier 
to compile the program WIDGET.EXE with the debugger symbol table 
information and to include the debugger in the image file.  The 
RUN command begins execution of the image WIDGET.EXE, which loops 
uncontrollably.  Control-Y interrupts the program, and the DEBUG 
command gives control to the debugger.


DELETE
 
$DELETE *.LOG;*
 
This command will delete all LOG files, all versions.  You must 
specify version number of file for security reasons.
 
$DELETE *.DAT;*/BEFOR=16-JUN/LOG
 
This will delete all DAT files, all versions before June 16 and 
will list what has been deleted.
 
DELETE A DIRECTORY
 
$DIRECTORY [.SUBDIR]
 no files found	(system response)
$SET PROTECTION SUBDIR.DIR/PROTECTION=OWNER:D
$DELETE SUBDIR.DIR;1
 
A directory must be empty before it can be deleted.  If the 
directory is protected from being deleted, you must set the 
protection down so the owner can delete it.
 
DELETE ENTRY
 
$PRINT/HOLD ALPHA.TXT
 Job 110 entered on queue SYS$PRINT
 
$DELETE/ENTRY=110 SYS$PRINT
 
This command puts ALPHA.TXT into the system print queue in hold 
state.  You can then delete the entry by identifying it by its 
job identification.
 
$SUBMIT/HOLD/parameters = scanline DOFOR
 Job 203 entered on queue SYS$BATCH	(system repsonse)
$SUBMIT/AFTER=18:00 WEATHER
 Job 210 entered on queue SYS$BATCH	(system response)
$DELETE/ENTRY = (203,210) SYS$BATCH
 
This will delete both batch jobs by entering the job 
identification numbers 203 and 210.
 
DIFFERENCES
 
$DIFFERENCES EXAMPLE.TXT
 
Compares the contents of the two most recent versions of the file 
EXAMPLES.TXT.  DIFFERENCES compares every character in every 
record and displays the results on the terminal.  This is similar 
to FILCOM on the TEN.


DIRECTORY
 
Files are listed in alphabetical order, with the highest numbered 
versions first.  The higher the version number the more recent 
the file.
 
EXAMPLE:  $DIRECTORY
MYPROG.EXE;3
MYPROG.EXE;2
MYPROG.EXE;1
XEROX.QUE;1
 
MYPROG.EXE has three different versions.  The most recent, 3, is 
listed first.
 
ERROR MESSAGES
 
Error messages either begin with a percent sign (%) or a hyphen 
(-).
 
Format:  %FACILITY-L-IDENT, text
 
FACILITY = 	Operating system facility, or program issuing error 
message.
 
L	=	Severity level; S for success, I for informational, W 
for warning, E for error, and F for fatal.
 
IDENT	=	Shorthand code for the message text.
 
If there is a series of error messages the first will begin with 
a percent sign and the following with a hyphen.
 
LINK
 
$LINK/MAP/CROSS_REFERENCES/EXECUTABLE=DBGWEATH/DEBUG-_/WEATHER,MA
THLIB/LIBRARY
 
$RUN DBGWEATH
%DEBUG-I-INITIAL, language is FORTRAN, module set to 'WEATHER" 
DBG>				(You are now in the debugger)
 
Linker links the object module WEATHER.OBJ with the debugger.  If 
any unresolved references are encountered, the link searches the 
library MATHLIB.OLB before searching the system library.  The 
CROSS_REFERENCES qualifier requests a cross reference listing in 
the map file; WEATHER.MAP.  The /EXECUTABLE requests the output 
file name DBGWEATH.EXE.  Now it is ready to accept debug 
commands.


MAIL
 
$MAIL/SUBJECT="New Project" PROJECT.DOC JONES,SMITH,ADAMS
 
File name PROJECT.DOC is to be sent to users Jones, Smith, and 
Adams, with a subject description of New Project in the heading.
 
MERGE
 
Combines two through ten similarly sorted input files and creates 
a single output file.  The input files to be merged must be in 
sorted order.
 
$MERGE/KEY=(POSITION:1,SIZE:80)/CHECK 
SEQUENCE[CUST.WORK]CUST01.-_DAT,[CUST.WORK]CUST02.DAT, 
CUSTMERGE.DAT
 
Two identically sorted disk files CUST01.DAT and CUST02.DAT in 
one directory are merged into another file CUSTMERGE.DAT in the 
current default directory.  The /CHECK_SEQUENCE input file 
qualifier is used to ensure that the files are sorted in the 
correct order.
 
Note that the input files are not in the current default 
directory, and therefore have the directory included as part of 
their file specifications.
 
MONITOR
 
$MONITOR PROCESSES/TPCPU
 
This command displays a bar graph showing the eight processes 
that were the top consumers of CPU.
 
MOUNTING DEVICES
 
To obtain exclusive use of a device:
 
$SHOW DEVICES MT:	(Will display what magtape drives are 
				 available)
$ALLOCATE MTB1:	(Allocate device MTB1 to my job)
 
Mounting Volumes on Devices:
$ALLOCATE DMA2:	(RK07)
$MOUNT DMA2:TEST_FILES INFILE
 
TEST_FILES is the volume label; INFILE is the lobical name 
(optional).
 
For operator interaction:
 
$ALLOCATE DMA1:
$MOUNT DMA1:TEST_FILES/COMMENT="Pack is in the tape library slot 
 6B"

	
The operator will see the following message:
 
%OPCOM, 17-Jan-83 15:47:50.26, Request 5, from user FRITZ
Please mount volume TEST_FILES in defice  _ DMA1:
Pack is in the tape library slot 6B
 
When the operator locates the physical volume and mounts it in 
the requested device you then receive the following messages:
 
%MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, TEST_FILES Mounted in _ DMA1:
%MOUNT-I-OPRQSTCAN, operator request cancelled you can begin 
  using volume.
 
When you are done with the pack:
 
$DISMOUNT DMA1:
$DEALLOCATE DMA1:
 
PHONE
 
You can talk to other users on your system or any other VAX/VMS 
system connected to your system by DECnet-VAX.
 
$PHONE DIRECTORY ROCK
 
This command establishes a DECnet link to ROCK and scans the 
system for users and lists the user's name and if their PHONE 
"status" is available or not available.  If available you can 
then DIAL the user and wait for them to ANSWER your call or 
REJECT the call.
 
$DIAL ROCK::DORENKAMP
 
This command means you've found that DORENKAMP is located on ROCK 
and her PHONE status is available.  After issuing the DIAL 
command PHONE broadcasts a message on DORENKAMP'S terminal that 
indicates you are calling.  This message will flash every ten 
seconds until DORENKAMP either ANSWERS the phone or REJECTS the 
call.
 
PROTECTION
 
R=READ; W=WRITE, E=EXECUTE; D=DELETE
 
SYSTEM:	Users with system privilege, generally System managers.
 
OWNER:	Users with the same UIC (User Identification Code)
	Example: UIC = [group number, member number]
 
GROUP:	All users, including the owner, who have the same group 
number in their UICs as the owner of the file.
 
WORLD:	All users including those in the first three categories.


$COPY DB1A:[PAYDATA]PAYROLL.DAT PAYSORT.DAT-
$_/PROTECTION=(SYSTEM:RW,OWNER:RWED,GROUP:RW,WORLD)
 
Users with system UICs can read and write to the file 
PAYSORT.DAT; you, the owner, have all types of access to 
PAYSORT.DAT.
 
Other users in your group may read and write to the file and all 
other users in the world have no access.
 
To change a protection:
$SET PROTECTION=(SYSTEM:RWE,OWNER:RWED,GROUP:RE,WORLD)
PAYSORT.EXE
 
To see what your default protection is:
$SHOW PROTECTION
 
To look at a specific file protection:
$DIRECTORY/PROTECTION PERSONNEL.REC

This utility deletes all but the highest-numbered version or 
versions of a specified file or files.
 
$PURGE AVERAGE.FOR/KEEP=2
 
The PURGE command deletes all but the two highest-numbered 
versions of the file AVERAGE.FOR.
 
REPLY
 
$REPLY/ALL "message text"
$REPLY/TERMINAL=(terminal-name[,...]) "messages text"
$REPLY/USER "message text"
 
/ALL sends a message to all terminals that are online and 
connected to the VAX/VMS system.
 
/TERMINAL sends a message to one or more specific terminals on 
the system.
 
/USER sends a message to all terminals at which system users are 
logged in.
 
Note: you need OPER privileges to use REPLY commands.
 
$REPLY/ABORT=identification-number "messsage-text"
$REPLY/PENDING=identification-number "message-text"
$REPLY/TO=identification-number "message-text"


/ABORT indicates that the user's request has been cancelled.
/PENDING sends a message to the user and keeps the user's process 
in a wait state until the request can be fulfilled or aborted.
 
/TO indicates that the user's request has been fulfilled.
 
$REPLY/ALL/BELL "SYSTEM GOING DOWN FOR EXEC PM. PLEASE LOG OFF"
 
This command broadcasts a message to all terminals on the system.

%OPCOM-S-OPRNOTIF, Operator notified, waiting....10:42:16.10
%OPCOM-S-OPRREPLY, No it will have to wait until 11:00
 
REQUEST sends a message to the operator, the operator REPLY's 
with an answer.
 
$REQUEST/REPLY "Are there any operators on duty to service 
my-_mount?"
 
This means you have a question and want a reply.
 
RUNOFF
 
$RUNOFF CHAPT1
 
RUNOFF takes input file CHAPT1.RNO and writes formatted output to 
the file CHAPT1.MEM.  This is the same as .R RUNOFF on the TEN.
 
SEARCH
 
Allows you to search through for specific character strings, 
returning a list of all lines containing occurrences of the 
string.
 
$SEARCH CABLE.MEM LAYER.MEM "manual title"
 
This will search both files for the character string manual 
title.


SET
 
There are many commands associated with SET.
Type HELP SET for all the various qualifiers.
 
Example:
 
$SET CONTROL=T
This command will enable control T to work.
 
SHOW
 
There are many commands associated with SHOW.  On the VAX type 
HELP SHOW for all the various qualifiers.
 
$SHOW USERS (Similar to SYSTAT on the TEN)
 
SORT
 
$SORT/KEY=(POSITION:1,SIZE:80) BOATS.LST BOATS.TMP
 
Sorts the records in the file BOATS.LST and creates an output 
file name BOATS.TMP.  All the records in the input file are 
sorted in alphanumberic order based on the first 80 characters in 
each record.
 
START
 
$START/QUEUE/BATCH SYS$BATCH. /BATCH indicates that this is a 
batch queue.
 
SUBMIT
 
$SUBMIT AVERAGE
 Job 112 entered on queue SYS$BATCH	(system response)
 
Enters procedure AVERAGE.COM in the batch job queue.  When the 
batch job completes the log file AVERAGE.LOG is queued for 
printing.  the filetype COM is the default extension as CTL is 
the default on the TEN.
 
TAPE USAGE
 
Magtapes are sequential access.
$ALLOCATE MT:
Request a tape drive whose name begins with MT.
_MTA2: ALLOCATED 	(system response)
 
Unit 2 on controller A was available. now allocated to you.


$INITIALIZE MTA2:GMB001/PROTECTION=(GROUP:R,WORLD)
 
Volume label GMB001 (6 character maximum): the protection code 
restricts group access to read and allows no access to the world.
 
$MOUNT MTA2:GMB001
$COPY *.* MTA2:/LOG (/LOG if you want to see what files are 
  copied)
 
The COPY command copies the highest versions of all files in your 
default directory onto the tape.
 
$DIRECTORY MTA2:
$DISMOUNT MTA2:
 
If you do not dismount your tape the system will do it for you 
when you log out.
 
$DEALLOCATE MTA2:
 
DEALLOCATE frees the devices for other users to use.  If you do 
not DEALLOCATE the device, other users cannot have access to it 
until you log out.
 
TYPE
 
$TYPE COMMON.DAT
 
The command requests that the file COMMON.DAT be displayed at the 
terminal.
 
$TYPE *.DAT
 .
 .
 .
Control O
 .
 .
 .
Control Y
$STOP
 
The TYPE command contains a wild character in place of the file 
name.  files with file types of DAT displayed; when CTRL/O is 
pressed, output of the current file stops and the TYPE command 
begins displaying the next DAT file.  CTRL/Y interrupts the 
command, the STOP command terminates the TYPE command.
