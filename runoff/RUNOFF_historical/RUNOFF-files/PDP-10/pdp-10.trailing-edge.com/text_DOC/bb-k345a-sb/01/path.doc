PATH.DOC -- Monitor level SETSRC commands and enhancements, V1(11)
June 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

PATH is a program that incorporates all of the functionality of SETSRC
while  adding  other  features to support the new functionality of the
7.01 monitor.  In particular, PATH offers added functionality  in  the
area of defining, manipulating and deleting logical path names.

PATH has been tested on KI, ks,  and  KL  processors  under  the  7.01
version  of  the  monitor.  It will run under earlier versions but all
logical path name commands will fail.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See PATH.CTL, and PATH.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

1      The sequence .PATH<CR> .CONTINUE<CR> caused I/O  to  unassigned
       channel.  Make CONTINUE act the same as REENTER.

2      Change the logical name code to know about the new  format  for
       the logical name block.

3      If PATH gets an error return trying to do a  /CLEAR,  it  loops
       forever  retrying the UUO.  Give up with an appropriate message
       if the /CLEAR fails

4      If /PHYSICAL is applied to any  component  in  a  logical  name
       definition,  PATH  will  ignore  any  existing  logical name in
       performing the substitution for the component.

5      In search list switches where  the  user  types  a  *  with  no
PATH.DOC                                                        Page 3


       modifiers (e.g., NOCREATE), keep the existing modifier bits for
       each structure represented by the *.

6      APLSTK was AOBJNing on the wrong AC sometimes causing  a  loop.
       Correct the AC.

7      "pa/mod:dskb:write" (note  the  lower  case)  would  result  in
       "?PTHUSM   Unknown  structure  modifier  7RITE".   Call  .SIXSW
       instead of .SIXSC.

10     Change the job search list before changing the default path  so
       the  user  can  do  both in the same command if the SFDs in the
       path only exist on the structure being added.

11     Change the processing of /SEARCH and /LIB to  reflect  the  new
       monitor algorithm.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
