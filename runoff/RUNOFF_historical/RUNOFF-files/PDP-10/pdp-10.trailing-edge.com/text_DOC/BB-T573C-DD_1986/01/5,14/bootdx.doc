BOOTDX.DOC -- Changes from V3(21) to V3A(24)
September 1984



1.0  SUMMARY

BOOTDX is a bootstrap program which is used for loading  the  DX10  or
DX20  micro-code  from  the  DSK:.   BOOTDX  runs in user-mode under a
DECsystem-10 timesharing system.  It requires 8P of memory but expands
for I/O buffers.  BOOTDX does I/O instructions directly to the DX10 or
DX20 hardware.  For this to work, the BOOTDX job must have  privileges
for the TRPSET function of the timesharing system.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS

Put BOOTDX on SYS:, if you  have  a  DX20,  put  DXMCA.ADX  (the  DX20
microcode) on SYS:.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

A check was put in for non-existent DX10'S.

Code was added so BOOTDX would not distrub the KLIPA or KLINI.
