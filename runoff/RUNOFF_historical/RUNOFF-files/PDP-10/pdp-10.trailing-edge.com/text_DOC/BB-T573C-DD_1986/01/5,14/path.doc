1.0  SUMMARY

This version of PATH adds several enhancements to the manipulation  of
default paths.  It has also been updated to use the new SCAN interface
(SWIL), allowing greater flexibility in file specifications.

PATH has been tested on KS and KL processors under the 7.03  and  7.02
versions of the monitor and supersedes all previous versions.  It will
run under earlier versions but certain types of logical name  commands
will fail.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

New switches (/UP and /DOWN), and some  enancements  to  default  path
changes.  See PATH.HLP for more details.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

See PATH.CTL.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

          The internal changes are documented in the revision  history
          in the source file PATH.MAC.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
