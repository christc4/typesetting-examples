F11 is a tool for manipulating the RSX-20F front-end  file  system  from
the  "-10" side of the disk.  The "HELP" command to F11 lists the syntax
of available commands.  In brief, F11 provides commands to copy files to
and  from  the  front-end  file system, delete files, obtain a directory
listing, create directories in the front-end file system, and initialize
a  front-end  file  system  (combining the functions of the "-10" FEFILE
program and the "-20F" INI task).
