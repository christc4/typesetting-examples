monitor   data   structures.   MAKSYM  is  especially  useful  for  auto
configuring monitors, as it removes the need to follow controller chains
to find the particular data structure you are interested in examining.

MAKSYM reads either a monitor crash dump file or the running monitor and
extracts   the  information  needed  to  define  symbolic  names.   This
information is written into a DDT command file called DSK:MAKSYM.DDT[-].
By using the $Y command in FILDDT you can read this command file and use
the defined names.

MAKSYM's naming convention for  data  structures  is  as  follows:   For
Kontroller  Data  Blocks, the name is of the form konKDB, where "kon" is
the controller name (for example, RPA, RNE, MTA, MTF, etc.).   For  disk
Unit  Data  Blocks,  the  name is of the form konmmm, where "kon" is the
controller name as described above, and "mmm" is the unit  number.   For
magtape  Unit  Data Blocks, the name is of the form konm, where "kon" is
the controller name as described above, and "m" is the unit number.  For
magtape Device Data Blocks, the name is of the form MDkm, where "k" is a
letter from the controller name as described above, and "m" is the  unit
number.

Examples

Suppose we have a monitor crash dump in  the  file  DSK:SER872.EXE.   We
want to look at parts of the disk data base to check the types of errors
which  were  encountered  while  the  monitor  was  running.    We   are
particularly  interested  in looking at unit RPA1's UDB.  We would first
run MAKSYM, and specify SER872 as the input file (defaults for the input
file  are  DSK:.EXE[-]).   When  MAKSYM  exits,  we  would  then run the
monitor-specific FILDDT and set up to examine SER872.  Next, type the $Y
command to FILDDT, and specify MAKSYM.DDT as the input file.  Now we can
say, for example, RPA1+UNIDES to look at the UNIDES word.

If we want to look at the same information in the  running  monitor,  we
simply  specify  /MONITOR  as  the  input file to MAKSYM, and proceed as
above.
