          SOS.DOC - changes from SOS V23(220) to SOS V23E(77)





This is an attempt to describe and compare the two existing versions  of
SOS.   However,  this is not a complete document describing both editors
in detail;  its  goal  is  to  explain  the  important  differences  and
enhancements of the new SOS.












                               CHAPTER 1

                   INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH THE OLD SOS



1.1  ASSUMED DOT ON FIND AND SUBSTITUTE COMMANDS

Before, a null range specifier (just a CR after the ESC), on the F and S
commands  would  start with the current line, and continue to the end of
file to the first occurrence of the string.  (e.g.,  start  with  .:EF).
The  new  SOS starts with the following line (e.g., .+1:EF).  So, if you
have printed line 100 and you give the command SA$B$ under the  new  SOS
it will not make the change starting with line 100.  In order to specify
that you want the current line you must specify "." at the end of your F
and S commands.



1.2  INSERT N LINES SYNTAX

The syntax for inserting n lines starting at line  m  has  changed  from
Im;!n to Im!n (the semicolon is now illegal).



1.3  IMPLIED DOT AS A PAGE SPECIFIER

The implied dot as a page specifier  has  been  removed.   However,  the
implied  dot  as  a line specifier still exists.  Thus P/ is illegal and
P/.  must be used instead.



1.4  ESCAPE AS A COMMAND

In display mode <ESC> no longer jumps up a line to save space on display
terminals.   This  was  thought  to be confusing, as what appeared to be
contiguous lines would be in reverse order.
INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH THE OLD SOS                              Page 1-2


1.5  DISPLAY MODE

The new SOS tries to do fancy things with display terminals.   In  order
to  take  advantage  of  this  feature,  your  terminal type must be set
correctly, or the display will not correctly reflect the  state  of  the
line.   Your terminal type can be set by the command ".TERMINAL xxx", or
by putting LOGIN/TERMINAL:TYPE:xxx in SWITCH.INI or by putting  TYPE:xxx
in  SYS:TTY.INI.   XXX  is  the  terminal type (VT05, VT52, VT100, LA36,
LA120, etc.).  To read the terminal type, type ".INITIA  TTY"  and  read
the  output  under  TYPE:.   In  addition,  all  terminal  name specific
switches such as /VT52 /VT05 etc have been removed.  SOS now reads  your
terminal  type as set by the monitor, and does the display processing as
best it can for the terminal type it thinks you are on.



1.6  SWITCH.INI

A great many extensions  have  been  added  to  SWITCH.INI.   Note  now,
SWITCH.INI  is  looked  for  under  your logged in PPN, even if you have
pivoted into another area or changed your  default  path  into  an  SFD.
Also, the /CORE:N switch has been removed, /WINDOW:N is nearly the same.



1.7  SPECIAL MATCH CHARACTERS

The special match characters available with the FIND and SEARCH commands
have  been  expanded.   A  complete list of the special match characters
appear below.  Note that  the  C128  representation  of  some  of  these
special  match  characters has been removed.  It is hoped that these are
more consistent and easily  remembered.   They  are  all  entered  as  a
control-E followed by a character, as described below:

^E equiv        meaning

     char

^EC     match any character
^EA     match any alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
^EL     match any letter (A-Z, a-z)
^EVU    match any upper case letter (A-Z)
^EVL    match any lower case letter (a-z)
^ED     match any digit (0-9)
^ES     match a separator
^E<space>  match a space or tab
^EZ     match end of line
^EB     match beginning of line

^EN     not the following character
^E*     zero or more of the following character
^E+     one or more of the following character
^EQ     quote the next character literally

and on s output strings:
INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH THE OLD SOS                              Page 1-3


^EX     next match string from input side
^EnM    n-th match string from input side
^EnVU   Upper case equivalent n-th match string from input side
^EnVL   Lower case equivalent n-th match string from input side



1.8  CONTROL-C DIALOG

The options in the  ^C  dialog  message  now  require  that  the  action
character  be  typed,  and  followed  with  a carriage return.  To allow
automatic exit without the dialog mode, use the  switch  /CCEXIT,  which
will allow you to ^C.



1.9  EXIT AND DELETE

The ED exit option is now illegal, unless the file you are editing is in
readonly  mode.   A  confirmation  to  delete the file will be required,
unless /DELETE is set.



1.10  EXACT CASE ON ALTER COMMANDS

The alter commands to search for a character  or  string  require  exact
case  match by default.  This may be overridden by the switch /NOAEXACT.
Note that Find and Substitute strings still do not  require  exact  case
match.



1.11  R SOS- CONSTRUCTION

Before, given the construction ".R SOS-" SOS would prompt for a new file
name, and "R SOS" would use the name of the previous file, if any.  Now,
either mode will use the  name  of  the  previous  file.   However,  the
construction  ".R SOS-file" will still edit "file", and is equivalent to
the prefered syntax of simply ".SOS file".












                               CHAPTER 2

                          NEW FEATURES OF SOS



2.1  FANCY ALTER MODE

On display terminals (ADDS, INFOTON, REGENT 100, VT52 and VT05, VT100) a
fancy alter mode is available.  This mode updates the line being altered
continuously as characters are added, deleted or  searched  for.   Also,
many  new  character,  word, and line altering commands have been added.
For more information on these, refer to the SOS manual.



2.2  PARAMETERS AND SWITCH.INI

A  large  number  of  parameters  controlling  the  edit  can   be   set
interactively,  or  in SWITCH.INI under SOS.  Again, please refer to the
SOS manual for more information.



2.3  DISPLAY TERMINALS

SOS handles rubouts, ^H, ^U, ^R correctly on all  display  terminals  by
overprinting  or deleting characters to produce an error free line.  The
following is a list of SOS supported terminals:  ADDS,  INFOTON,  REGENT
100,  VT52,  and  VT05.  To set SOS to work with one of these terminals,
use the set parameter command (i.e., _DISPLAY)  or  include  the  switch
/DISPLAY  in  the  SOS line in SWITCH.INI.  (note that this parameter is
set by default)



2.4  IMPROVED SPEED

SOS is considerably faster than the older SOS in file I/O.  This makes a
significant  difference  when  working with larger files or when exiting
the editor.  Some of the parameters  that  can  control  SOS  speed  are
/WINDOW/BUFFER/WRATIO/WMAXIMUM/WMINIMUM.
NEW FEATURES OF SOS                                             Page 2-2


2.5  HELP COMMAND

The help  command  has  an  important  extension.   H,C  will  type  out
information  about  the  C  command,  H/S  will  type out information on
switch/parameter S.



2.6  BUG FIXES

SOS fixes a lot of bugs with the current SOS.



2.7  P COMMAND

The P command (print PLINE lines) now does not cross page boundaries.



2.8  CO-EDIT CAPABILITY

SOS has the capability to edit two files simultaneously.  The  user  can
switch  between  files  with the CX command, copy lines from one file to
the other with the CC command, or transfer lines from one  file  to  the
other with the CT command.



2.9  FILE NAMES AND EXITING

Upon leaving the editor (with E or G commands) the user has  the  option
of  changing  the filename.  By appending the string ":file" to the exit
command, the updated file is written to <file> instead of  the  original
file name at the start of the edit.

In addition, appending a "R:file" to the exit command, will cause SOS to
exit  the first file, and begin editing the second file.  This is useful
as all of the parameters of  the  first  edit  (search  strings,  switch
settings, etc.) are retained.

A new command O:file,range will write out <range> to a new  file  called
<file> with the option of superseding or appending to the output file.



2.9.1  Expanded Find And Substitute Options

Options (including the repeat count) may now be specified in any  order,
separated by commas, following the FIND or SUBSTITUTE command.

The following FIND options are available:

A         ALTER the found lines
D         DELETE the found lines
NEW FEATURES OF SOS                                             Page 2-3


N         ONLY print out line numbers of specified lines
-         find lines not containing specified find strings
*         INFINITE repeat (like ,10000)

The following SUBSTITUTE options are available:

D         enter DECIDE mode on substitute confirm
S         SILENCE, do not print out specified lines at all

The following options are available to  both  the  FIND  and  SUBSTITUTE
commands:

E         require EXACT case match of strings
T         give a TOTAL lines summary at the end
U         print specified lines UNSEQUENCED



2.9.2  Indirect Command File Repeat

Previously, the only way to repeat a sequence of commands in  a  command
was  to  repeat the commands N times in the command file, or to nest the
command file to call itself.  The first method was  impractical  in  the
general  case, and the second incurs a lot of monitor and disk overhead,
reading the command file for each time it is repeated.  To  avoid  these
problems,  a  comma  followed by a number may be specified at the end of
the indirect command file specification which is the number of times  to
repeat the command file.  Or, optionally the number can be "*" to repeat
the command file indefinitely (until some  command  in  it  fails).   It
should  be  noted  that  under  this  command  file  repeat  there  is a
restriction that the command file fit in 1 disk block (128 words or  640
characters).












                               CHAPTER 3

                    COMPATIBILITY MODE (/OLDCOMMAND)



3.1  SETTING AND CLEARING 

By default, SOS is in compatibility (/OLDCOMMAND)  mode.   This  may  be
overridden  by  the  /NEWCOMMAND  switch  placed  in  SWITCH.INI or as a
switch/settable parameter in SOS command mode.  /OLDCOMMAND  mode  makes
SOS work like the old SOS as much as possible.



3.2  DESCRIPTION

The following is a list of changes that are enabled  when  compatibility
mode (/OLDCOMMAND) is set:

     1.  /QZBAK is the default.  This writes *.Q??   and  *.Z??   backup
         files.

     2.  /EXPERT defaults /NOINFORM, /NOVICE defaults /INFORM.

     3.  Exit options S and B mean unsequence and nobackup respectively.

     4.  N is treated like NF (renumber file) instead of renumbering the
         current page only.

     5.  The default STEP and START are 100, and not 10.

     6.  In alter mode V means invert case of word, # means invert  case
         to  end  of  line,  and  X  means replace current word, T means
         extend the line.













                               CHAPTER 4

                 BUILDING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



4.1  BUILDING FROM SOURCES

SOS.CTL will rebuild the entire  product  from  sources,  including  the
production  of  .LST files.  It also uses RUNOFF to create various .DOC,
.MAN, and .HLP files.  Note that ENDECR.MAC is not provided with  SOS  -
it is part of BACKUP too, and it may be necessary to copy this file from
the BACKUP sources in order to rebuild.

In addition, we have provided SOSGLB.MIC which can  be  used  to  create
both .MAP and .GLB files.  This is not normally called from SOS.CTL, but
by changing the !.DO SOSGLB to .DO SOSGLB (remove the "!"  in  SOS.CTL),
one  can get these produced as a part of the full rebuild process.  Note
that both of these control files use SOSLOD.CCL.



4.2  INSTALLATION

There are five files which should be installed.  SOS.EXE belongs on SYS:
(or  NEW:), SOS.HLP belongs on HLP:, and there are three files (SOS.DOC,
SOS.MAN, and SOS23.MAN) which belong on DOC:.  Also, you may wish to put
SOSREF.MEM  (a  brief reference manual) and SOSMCR.DOC (a guide to using
the new SOS MACRO facility) on DOC:.
