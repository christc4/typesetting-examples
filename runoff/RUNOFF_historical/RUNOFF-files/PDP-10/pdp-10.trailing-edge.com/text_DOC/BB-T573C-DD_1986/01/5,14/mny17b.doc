1.0  SUMMARY

This release of MONEY adds support for FACT entries written by  UMOUNT
and  OMOUNT,  Version 26, (code 271).  No other changes have been made
and no restrictions or bugs attended to.   It  has  been  tested  with
5.07/5.07A/6.01A.   It  has  not been tested in house on 5.06 monitors
but is meant to work on them.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The MOUNT entries are very much like the SPOOL entry  except  for  the
following words:

        0 code = 271

Job number is UMOUNTer's job number unless that job logged off;  else,
and for of entries, it is OMOUNT's job number.

        1 user's PPN
        3 QUE = 1st letter of program (O or U) concatenated  with  1st
        letter of command (M or D or F).  'UF' is not used.
        10 The device mounted, dismounted or used in a FILE command
        11 0
        12 F,,TIME
        F = 0 if request failed
        F = 1 if successful
        TIME = time in seconds OMOUNT dedicated to this request

MONEY processes code 271 entries like SPOOL  entries  except  for  the
processing of the units word, which for MOUNT entries is 'flags,,clock
time'.  MONEY produces two fields for this word in  approximately  the
same columns as used for SPOOL units.
