DTELDR.DOC -- Changes from V4(35) to V5(50)
June 1983



1.0  SUMMARY

This release updates DTELDR to run under TOPS10 Version 7.02.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

DTELDR is now a two segmented program.   During  booting  and  dumping
operations,  it  only  locks  it's  low  segment,  which  makes  for a
substantial savings of EVM.  The size of the low segment is  7  pages.
This version of DTELDR is also compatible with pre-7.02 monitors.

There are also three new switches:


2.1  /PROTOCOL:prottype

This switch takes an argument of ANF10, DECNET, or IBM.  The  argument
indicates  which  protocol is to be run over the DTE for the front end
that is being initialized.  In reality there are  only  two  protocols
that  run over the DTE.  The first is Queued Protocol Version 1, which
is used by ANF10, IBM, and RSX20F.   The  second  is  Queued  Protocol
Version  2  which  is  used by DECnet.  If the /PROTOCOL switch is not
specified then the default protocol type is ANF10.   The  default  (of
ANF10)  will be used each time a new command line is specified, unless
the /PROTOCOL switch is seen.

This switch can also be used with /INITIALIZE if you want to  start  a
front end with a particular protocol.

Note that DTELDR cannot load DECnet front ends, but now it can be used
to start them.


2.2  /APROTOCOL:XY:prottype

This switch is the automatic mode counterpart of /PROTOCOL.  The first
argument  is  the  standard  DTELDR  CPU/DTE  descriptor.   The second
argument is as described above for /PROTOCOL.  This switch sets  up  a
default  protocol  for  a specific CPU/DTE.  This default is used when
when in automatic mode, and when the /PROTOCOL switch is not specified
in  a  command  line.   The default protocol type for an automatically
reloaded front end is ANF10.  Note that /PROTOCOL will  supercede  any
previous /APROTOCOL settings for the duration of the command line.


2.3  /DETACH

This switch will cause DTELDR to detach  itself  when  the  /AUTOMATIC
DTE5.DOC                                                        Page 3


switch goes into effect.  All output will be redirected to OPR via the
QUEUE.  UUO.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

A sample segment of OPR.ATO and SYSJOB.INI are presented here.

Detaching from OPSER:

        :SLOG
        :DEF DTE=
        DTE-R DTELDR
        DTE-/IGNORE:01:03:12:13
        DTE-/APROTOCOL:02:ANF10:11:IBM/DETACH
        DTE-/AUTO

Detaching from the Force Line:

        LOG
        DTELDR
        /IGNORE:01:03:12:13
        /APROTOCOL:02:ANF10:11:IBM/DETACH
        /AUTO



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

DTELDR now does a .DTESU DTE.  function in order to set  the  protocol
type.  If this function fails under a pre-7.02 monitor, then the error
is just ignored.  DTELDR is  now  TWOSEGged,  and  must  be  shareably
saved.   This  is so that only the low segment needs to lock.  All TTY
I/O is now redirectible, so that DTELDR can now do various things with
it's output.

DTELDR.DOC -- Changes from V2(26) to V4(35)
March 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

DTELDR is a program to dump and bootstrap front ends connected to  the
KL10  (1080  to 1099 systems) via DTE20s.  This release of DTELDR will
support DN20s on  1091  systems.   The  console  line  of  a  DN20  is
connected  to  a line on the master front end instead of a terminal as
on a DN87S.  A pending ECO will do the same to DN87Ss sometime in  the
future  and  will be installed at field service's discretion.  The new
DTELDR features will not affect DN87Ss until TOPS-10 7.00.

DTELDR will run on all TOPS-10 KL based systems under 6.03  and  later
monitors.   There  is  no  point  in  running DTELDR on KA or KI based
systems.

System notebook documents that reference DTELDR include  the  Networks
Software Installation Guide and the DECsystem-10 Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

DTELDR now logs all loads and dumps of front ends in ERROR.SYS.

DTELDR running in /AUTO mode will not reload any front ends if  ST%NDL
is  set in the system states word (GETTAB = %CNSTS).  this is the same
bit that is used to control down-line loads by NETLDR.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Refer to DTE2.DOC.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

DTELDR now performs a DAEMON UUO to log all reloads in ERROR.SYS.

System notebook documents that reference DTELDR include  the  Networks
Software   Installation   Guide  (AA-5156A-TB)  and  the  DECsystem-10
Operator's Guide (AA-51504A-TB).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The major change in this release is to attempt to log CHK11 and  other
output  from  DN20s  on  the  terminal  controlling  DTELDR.   This is
possible by the hardware configuration of DN20s and eventually DN87Ss.
These  communication  front  ends  (FEs)  have their console DL11 line
connected to another DL11 in the master  front  end  (RSX-20F).   Thus
output  to  a  comm. FE CTY shows up as input to the DEC-10 and DEC-10
output shows up as input to from the FE's CTY.

If DTELDR is used as version 1 was, all comm. FE output (e. g.  CHK11)
will  be  intercepted  by  the  DTELDR  running  in automatic mode and
printed on its terminal.  Two new switches modify this operation.


2.1  /IGNORE:XY:XY:...:XY

This switch takes a list of FEs and will ignore anything that  happens
to them and will not access their CTYS.  This command is useful mainly
to  system  programmers  who  don't  want  a  FE  they  are  debugging
automatically reloaded.


2.2  /NOLISTEN:XY:XY:...:XY

This switch also takes a list of FEs and tells DTELDR  not  to  access
the  FE's  CTY  line except when reloading the FE.  This is useful for
systems programmers who want FEs automatically reloaded but also  want
total access to a FE for their own needs.
DTE2.DOC                                                        Page 6


Both these  swtiches  leave  the  CTY  lines  of  all  FEs  referenced
available  to  any  job and should not be used except by sites without
problems from malicious users.  Once used, the only way  to  undo  the
effect of these switches is to CTRL/C DTELDR and restart it.


2.3  /TALK:XY

This switch may be used either alone or with the /AUTOMATIC or /RELOAD
switches.   When  used  alone, it takes a single FE as an argument and
will "crosspatch" the controlling terminal to  that  FE's  CTY.   This
allows  users  to  talk to diagnostics and debuggers.  The only way to
break the crosspatch is to CTRL/C DTELDR and then restart or reenter.

When used to modify  /AUTO  or  /RELOAD,  /TALK  does  not  accept  an
argument.  These commands will enter talk mode when new code is loaded
(the initializing message) and leave when the code requests  to  start
primary  protocol  (the  "started"  message).   If  used with /RELOAD,
analogous operation will occur except that no timeout will occur while
waiting  for primary protocol to start since the user is in control of
the situation.


2.4  Minor changes

All messages of the form "PDP-11 loading", "PDP-11 started", etc.  are
now of the form "front end XY loading".  This will make automatic mode
more informative.

DTELDR will no longer send the "front end XY has just  been  reloaded"
message to OPR since DTELDR messages normally print on OPR anyway.

DTELDR will now load FEs on any CPU (this depends on release  7.00  of
TOPS-10).



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Unchanged since release 1 (see section 4.0 in DTE1.DOC).
DTE2.DOC                                                        Page 7


5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The major change to implement communication with the FE CTY lines  was
to  build  a  data  structure for each FE that can possibly exist in a
system.  For each FE (including RSX-20F FEs) there is  a  DTE  control
block (DTB).  Information in each DTB includes flags, ASCII and binary
representations of the FE, the UDX of the FE's CTY line (if any),  and
a line assembly buffer for data from the FE.

Since DTELDR has to maintain open IO channels across commands,  (i. e.
a  MPX  channel used to listen to FE CTYs), the restart logic has been
cleaned up so that it no longer has to use  a  RESET  UUO  after  each
command.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

The major suggestion is to log CHK11 output in ERROR.SYS.

DTELDR.DOC -- V1(21)
December 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

DTELDR is a program to dump and bootstrap front ends connected to  the
KL10  (1080  or 1090 systems) via the DTE20.  Presently, this includes
the KL Front End (RSX20F) and the DN87S in TOPS-10 6.03.

DTELDR will run only on 6.03 and is required to run  on  all  1080  or
1090 systems.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

As DTELDR is an entirely new program, the HELP file is reproduced here
in its entirity.

DTELDR is a program to dump and bootstrap front ends connected to  the
KL10 via a DTE20.  Command format is:

*DEV:FILE.EXT[P,PN,SFD,SFD,.  .]/SWITCH/SWITCH

     or

*/SWITCH/SWITCH

DEV:FILE.EXT[P,PN,SFD,SFD, .  .] is the  file  specification  for  the
file  to  load into the -11.  Default is DSK:DTEL<X><Y>.BIN, where <X>
is the CPU number (only 0 allowed in current implementation)  and  <Y>
is the DTE number (0,1,2 or 3).  This specification is only meaningful
if the -11 is loaded over the DTE20.  (See /SWITCH)

Dumps are written out to DSK:DTED<X><Y>.BIN, .B00, .B01,  etc.   Using
path of job that runs DTELDR.

Action switches:  (<FE#> indicates front end number, <CPU#><DTE#  from
0-3>

/AUTOMATIC - automatically reload front ends that crash
/HELP - type this text
/TERMINATE:<FE#> - shut down specified front end
/RELOAD:<FE#> - reload specified front end and start primary protocol
/INITIALIZE:<FE#> - start primary protocol on specified front end

Modification Switches:

/IMAGE - .BIN file is in image format
/NODUMP - do not do dump of -11 core
/SELECT:<10,11> - select place to reload -11 from
/SWITCH:<VALUE> - use octal <VALUE> instead of old -11 switch value
/NOLOG - suppress error logging
DTE1.DOC                                                        Page 9


A DUMP file specification may be given for /AUTOMATIC.   The  switches
/NOLOG, /NODUMP, and /SWITCH may also be specified with /AUTOMATIC.

/SELECT:10 reloads the front end over the DTE20 from the  reload  file
specification.   /SELECT:11  reloads the front end from the -11 device
specified in /SWITCH, or from the original -11 load device if  /SWITCH
is not specified.

If /SELECT is not given, default is "11" if the  -11  is  the  master,
"10" otherwise.

/TERMINATE and /INITIALIZE must not appear with any other switches.

/SWITCH is used when the reload source is the  -10  to  tell  the  ROM
which  -11 device to obtain the reload file from.  RSX20 also uses the
switch setting to determine whether to enter KLINIT or not.

Masks for Values:

     3400 - unit number field
      200 - If one, use RP04.  Otherwise, use Floppy or DECtape,
            in that order (with BM873-YH ROM)
        7 - KLINIT Field
           0 - Ignore Switches
           1 - Enter KLINIT, give default answers to questions
           3 - Do not enter KLINIT
           5 - Same as 3
           7 - Enter KLINIT dialog



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs or deficiencies in this version.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The DTELDR package contains the following files:

     DTE1.RND
     DTELDR.HLP
     DTELDR.MAC
     DTELDR.CTL
     DTELDR.EXE

Since DTELDR only works on a 1080 or 1090 system there is no  need  to
install  it  on other systems.  For systems that need DTELDR, its .EXE
file should be put on SYS:  and the .HLP on hlp:.  Systems that do not
have  a  DN87S  should add the following to OPR.ATO to provide for the
automatic reloading of the console front end processor.
DTE1.DOC                                                       Page 10


     :SLOG
     :DEF DTE=
     DTE-R DTELDR
     DTE-/AUTO

Systems with DN87S's must also add INITIALIZE switches for  the  DTE's
they are connected to.  For example, a site with 2 DN87S's, one on DTE
#1 and the other on DTE #2 should have in their OPR.ATO :

     :SLOG
     :DEF DTE=
     DTE-R DTELDR
     DTE-/INIT:1
     DTE-/INIT:2
     DTE-/AUTO



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

As DTELDR is newly released, this section is not applicable.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
