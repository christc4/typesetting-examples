SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

SYSDPY  is  a  program  designed  to   dynamically   display   various
parameters,  statistics,  etc.,  for  both  selected  jobs  and/or the
time-sharing system as a whole.  Basically, SYSDPY is a  SYSTAT  which
runs  on  selected  video terminals in an update-mode wherein only the
information which changes actually gets re-typed.

SYSDPY V703(634) has several new  displays  reflecting  new  operating
system   features  available  with  the  V7.03  TOPS-10  monitor.   In
addition,  several  new  fields  are  displayed  in  currently  extant
displays, and several new commands have been added.

SYSDPY V703(634) departs from previous versions of SYSDPY in  that  it
runs ONLY under TOPS-10 V7.03, it does NOT run under previous versions
of the monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

SYSDPY V703(634) has several visible-to-the-user changes,  both  small
and large, and several new commands.

For a detailed guide to the care and feeding of SYSDPY  V703(634)  the
user is refered to the user's guide file SYSDPY.MAN.



2.1  "E" Command -- NI Network Display

The "E" command now generates an NI ("Ethernet") network display.  See
the SYSDPY.MAN user's guide for details.



2.2  "K" Command -- CI Network Display

The  "K"  command  now  generates  a  CI  network  display.   See  the
SYSDPY.MAN user's guide for details.



2.3  "Z" Command -- LAT Display

The "Z" command now generates  a  LAT  statistics  display.   See  the
SYSDPY.MAN user's guide for details.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.4  "n!" Command -- Non-idle Jobs In "N" Display

The "^N" command in SYSDPY V435 (edit 600) has been changed to the "!"
command  in SYSDPY V703.  Additionally, a numeric argument may precede
the command to set the idle time threshold.



2.5  "F" Command File System Display

The File System Display no longer shows  "Seeks"  for  disk  units  in
order  to  expand  the other more-meaningful reads and writes columns.
Two new columns have been added to the swapping  display  -  "PR"  and
"PW" to indicate "Paging Reads" and "Paging Writes" respectively.



2.6  "N" Command Normal System Display

The Normal Display of system statistics has a new line  labeled  "ETH"
to  show  Ethernet  traffic.  Also a new event wait code "EE" has been
added for "Event wait Ethernet".



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

When running under a KS/DECnet  monitor,  the  "DCN"  status  line  is
suppressed.  This is due to the nature of the KS/DECnet monitor.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The build procedure for SYSDPY is documented in the CUSP control file,
and is unchanged from the previous release.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The internal SYSDPY changes for V703(634) are documented in  the  edit
history in the begining of the file SYSDPY.MAC.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

     1.  Consolidate all the different flavours  of  SYSDPY  into  one
         single display package.
