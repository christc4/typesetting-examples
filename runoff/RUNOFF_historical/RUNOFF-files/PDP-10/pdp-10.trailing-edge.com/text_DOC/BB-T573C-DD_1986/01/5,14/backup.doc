BACKUP.DOC -- Changes from V4(440) TO V5(613)
April 1985



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a combined development and maintenance release  of  BACKUP,  a
program for transferring files between disk and magnetic tape.

Version 5 of BACKUP must  be  loaded  with  field  image  versions  of
HELPER,  WILD,  and  SCAN.   ENDECR and USGSUB are modules specific to
BACKUP;  the ones to be used for loading  BACKUP  are  distributed  on
this tape.

BACKUP version 5 is supported by Digital  Equipment  Corporation,  and
runs  on all supported monitors as released.  Version 5 supersedes all
previous versions.

Documentation  for  using  BACKUP  is  contained  in  the  help   file
BACKUP.HLP,  the  TOPS10  Operating  System  Commands  Manual, and the
TOPS10 Operator's Guide of the TOPS10 software notebooks.   A  program
logic  manual  for BACKUP and the worker module BACKRS can be produced
by submitting the source files (BACKUP.MAC and BACKRS.MAC)  to  RUNOFF
Version 10.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  Version numbers of files stored on the tape are now  included
         in the listing file.

     2.  There is a new status-setting verb, /ERRMAX:n,  which  allows
         the  user  to  set  the  maximum number to tape errors before
         giving the fatal error message ?BKPRTE.  The default  is  100
         decimal.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following deficiencies are known to exist in Version 5:

     1.  Full  .SCWLD  style  of  pattern  replacements  is  not   yet
         implemented.

     2.  "'NOT'",  etc.,  in  full  .LKWLD   implementation   is   not
         operational.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Files involved:

BACKUP.MAC, BACKRS.MAC, ENDECR.MAC, USGSUB.MAC -- source  files  which
make up this product.

BACKUP.EXE -- the executable file.

BACKUP.HLP -- the help file.

BACKUP.DOC -- the documentation file.

To install BACKUP on your system, copy the file BACKUP.EXE to SYS:.

The distributed version of BUILD.CTL was used to  first  build  BACKUP
using  field  image  software.   Customers  who wish to rebuild BACKUP
after installing any changes can use  BUILD.CTL  as  a  guide  to  the
building  process.  In that case, however, it is unlikely that the CTL
file can be executed without modification on most  user  systems.   In
particular,  attention  should  be  given to ersatz devices, structure
names, PPNs and other such system parameters.

The following TOPS-10 commands provide a quick way of creating  a  new
version of BACKUP.EXE.  To build the program you must use MACRO V.53B:

     .LOAD BACKUP.MAC, BACKRS.MAC
     .SSAVE BACKUP

This assumes MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV and SCNMAC.UNV are on device  UNV:
and that SCAN.REL, WILD.REL, HELPER.REL, ENDECR.REL and USGSUB.REL are
on REL:.

6.0  NEW ERROR MESSAGES

None.
