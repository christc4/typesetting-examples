SETSRC.DOC -- Changes from V12A(46) to V12B(47)
June 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 12B(47) of SETSRC is now compatible with  MACRO  50.   Version
12A(46) of SETSRC would not compile correctly with MACRO 50 because it
used a reserved MACRO 50 keyword as a label.

SETSRC 12B(47) runs on all supported monitors and fully supersedes all
previous versions.

SETSRC is documented  in  the  following  documents  in  the  Software
Notebooks:   TOPS-10 OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS and SETSRC, program for
printing and changing jobs search list.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Copy SETSRC.EXE to SYS:.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit 47   A macro was changed to force address  calculation  to  avoid
          conflict with the reserved keyword 'JSYS".

SETSRC.DOC -- Changes from V12 to V12A(46)
June 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

SETSRC V12A differs from V12 in that V12A has been updated to the  new
JOBDAT.   SETSRC  V12  has  one bug fixed which occurs when V11 is run
under a 5.04 or 5.03 monitor.  This bug  caused  the  warning  message
'%/LIB/SYS/NEW  NOT SUPPORTED IN THIS MONITOR' to be erroneously typed
to some commands (even though /LIB /SYS or /NEW  were  not  specified)
under  5.04.  Since V12 follows V11 by only one month the remainder of
this .DOC file gives the changes from V10 to V11.

SETSRC V11 has  been  extensively  modified  to  enhance  its  current
functions as well as support new features of 5.05 (/NEW /SYS /LIB).

A help file (SETSRC.HLP) has been written for  use  with  the  monitor
help command.

SETSRC is documented  in  the  following  documents  in  the  software
notebooks:   TOPS-10 OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS and SETSRC, program for
printing and changing jobs search list.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

New commands:

     A         ADD F.S.'S
     R         REMOVE F.S.'S
     M         MODIFY F.S. STATUS
     AS RS MS  SIMILAR FUNTCTIONS FOR SYS. SRC. LST.

New switches:

     /SYS      ADD SYS: SEARCHING TO DSK:
     /NEW      ADD [1,5] SEARCHING TO SYS:
     /LIB      ADD LIBRARY SEARCHING TO DSK:
     '*' IN F.S. LISTS IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN 'CURRENT SRC.LST'.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

/LIB /SYS & /NEW are only supported in 5.05 or later.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

SETSRC has been extensively recoded and must be assembled  with  C.MAC
(E.G.  compile C+SETSRC)
