ACCT.DOC -- The Accounting System Components
December 1985



1.0 Summary

This file now describes ACTDAE, REACT and NEWACT.

ACTDAE V2

     This is a development release of  ACTDAE.   It  has  been  tested
under  7.02,  702A,  and 7.03 and fully supersedes ACTDAE V1.  Most of
the  changes  made  are  in  support  of  the  accounting  project  in
conjunction  with  the  7.03 monitor release.  ACTDAE V2 must run with
GALAXY V5.1 components.


REACT V33

     This is a development release of REACT.  It has been tested under
7.02,  702A,  and  7.03 and fully supersedes V32.  This new release of
REACT is part of the accounting project in conjunction with  the  7.03
monitor release.  The REACT program has been completely rewritten.  It
now uses the GLXLIB run-time system and uses the COMND JSYS  simulator
of  GLXLIB  to  handle command parsing.  Further documentation for the
new REACT program can be found in the  TOPS-10  Software  Installation
Guide.


NEWACT V1

     The NEWACT program is a tool supplied to convert existing version
4  ACCT.SYS  files to the new format of the version 6 ACTDAE.SYS file.
NEWACT uses information from ACCT.SYS, AUXACC.TXT,  and  USERS.TXT  to
build  a  ACTDAE.SYS  file.  If no USERS.TXT file is present, the user
names from ACCT.SYS will be used.  NEWACT is intended to be  run  once
to build a ACTDAE.SYS file.



2.0 External Changes

ACTDAE

     With TOPS-10 Version 7.03, ACTDAE also manages the  user  account
file,  SYS:ACTDAE.SYS.   LOGIN, SPRINT, FAL, and the new REACT program
now validate and  update  user  profiles  (user  account  entries)  by
communicating  with  ACTDAE  via the QUEUE.  UUO.  ACTDAE also keeps a
"failure" log file open,  ACT:FAILUR.LOG.   The  types  of  "failures"
logged are:  

1) Password validation failures from LOGIN, SPRINT, FAL
2) Account string validation failures
3) Attempts by unprivileged jobs to perform accounting functions
ACCT.DOC                                                        Page 3


The format of the FAILUR.LOG file is similar to the  usage  accounting
file  -  all  readable  ASCII.   For  more information see the TOPS-10
Software Installation Guide.


REACT

     ACCT.SYS, AUXACC.SYS, STRLST.SYS, and  QUOTA.SYS  are  no  longer
maintained   by  REACT.   ACCT.SYS  and  AUXACC.SYS  are  replaced  by
SYS:ACTDAE.SYS.  STRLST.SYS is maintained by the  CATALOG  application
under  OPR, and QUOTA.SYS is maintained by the QUOTA application under
OPR.  REACT now only uses QUEUE.  UUOs to communicate with ACTDAE when
inserting/changing/deleting user profiles.  New functionality has been
added to REACT.  There is now a means of maintaining a  "master"  user
account  file.   The  user  account  file  can now be "locked" against
updates.  See the TOPS-10 Installation Guide.


NEWACT

     NEWACT is a tool  that  creates  a  ACTDAE.SYS  file  (version  6
accounting  format)  from  existing  (version  4)  user account files.
NEWACT extracts information  from  DSK:ACCT.SYS,  DSK:AUXACC.SYS,  and
(optionally) DSK:USERS.TXT.  The new ACTDAE.SYS file is created in the
current path and should be copied to SYS:  before ACTDAE V2 is run.  



3.0 Known Bugs and Deficiencies

None.



4.0 Installation Instructions

The following universal files  are  required  by  ACTDAE,  REACT,  and
NEWACT:   ACTSYM,  ACTPRM, QSRMAC, GLXMAC, ORNMAC, UUOSYM, and RMSINT.
ACTPRM is created when compiling ACTLIB.  The following libraries  are
expected  to reside on SYS:  RMS.REL and B361LB.REL.  Note:  RMS-10 is
bundled with the TOPS-10 monitor.  It is distributed with the  monitor
on the cusp tape.

The files ACTLIB.MAC and ACTCUS.MAC are common files.  ACTLIB contains
the  routines  that  interface  ACTDAE  with  the RMS-10 routines that
ACTDAE requires at link time.  The new accounting file, ACTDAE.SYS  is
a  RMS  indexed  file.   ACTCUS.MAC  contains some password encryption
algorithms (supplied  as  examples  only,  no  warranty  expressed  or
implied),  and  the  hooks  for  customer modifications to REACT.  The
location CURALG in ACTCUS contains the  current  encryption  algorithm
index.

Compile ACTLIB.MAC and ACTCUS.MAC.
ACCT.DOC                                                        Page 4


ACTDAE

Compile ACTRCD.MAC, ACTDAE.MAC.

Load ACTDAE.REL with ACTLIB and ACTCUS, searching the  latter  two  as
libraries.

Save the loaded core image on SYS:.

Verify that ersatz device ACT:  (PPN [1,7]) exists on  all  structures
in  the  system  search  list, if account validation is required, SYS:
contains PROJCT.SYS.  This is a change -  PROJCT.SYS  must  reside  on
SYS:.   (See  sections  3.2.4.1,  3.2.4.2,  and  3.2.4.3 in USGFUN.MEM
concerning account validation).

Verify that your  user  account  file,  ACTDAE.SYS  is  on  SYS:.   If
converting  from  version  4  to version 6 user accounting, the NEWACT
program will create a ACTDAE.SYS file that can be copied to SYS:   For
new installations, copy the ACTDAE.SYS supplied on the CUSP tape.


REACT

There are 3 assembly parameters that can be set by the customer:

DEFPSZ determines the size of the  random  passwords  that  REACT  can
generate.  REACT is shipped with DEFPSZ=^D6.

Compile REACT.MAC.  Load module ACTPRM from ACTLIB.REL, REACT.REL, and
then load ACTLIB and ACTCUS in library search mode.

Place REACT.EXE on SYS:.


NEWACT

For sites with local changes in the  user  account  files,  NEWACT.MAC
will  have  to  be  modified  before running.  See the instructions in
NEWACT.MAC.

Compile NEWACT.MAC and LOAD NEWACT.REL, searching ACTLIB and ACTCUS in
library search mode.

Place NEWACT.EXE anywhere it is convenient.  

When run, NEWACT must be able to access DSK:ACCT.SYS,  DSK:AUXACC.SYS,
and  (optionally) DSK:USERS.TXT.  The ACTDAE.SYS file built is created
in the current path.



5.0 Internal Changes

ACTDAE
ACCT.DOC                                                        Page 5


     ACTDAE.MAC has had code added to support the requirements for the
new  accounting  project.   Changes were also made in support of USAGE
billing and file closure EVENTs.  ACTLIB.MAC  is  completely  new  and
contains  the  routines that ACTDAE needs to maintain the user account
file in conjunction with the RMS routines.  ACTCUS.MAC  is  completely
new and it contains the password encryption routines that are availble
for use.  

REACT has been completely rewritten for V33.

NEWACT was written to be a  tool  in  converting  from  version  4  to
version 6 user accounting.



6.0 Suggestions

None.
