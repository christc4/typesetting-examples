MAKVFU.DOC -- Changes from version 1(17) to version 2(33)
October, 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

This version of  MAKVFU  adds  several  new  commands,  adds  explicit
support for the LP05 and LP14 printers, and fixes a number of bugs.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Three new commands have been added to MAKVFU.  The TYPE  command  sets
defaults  for  a  specific  line printer type.  The CLEAR command will
clear all settings for a specific VFU channel.  The NEW  command  will
clear the entire VFU.  ALL three commands are explicitly documented in
the MAKVFU.HLP file.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit

[18] - lp100 h.w. change - maximum external line no. (mxlinx) =143.
     not 144. therefore, max. internal line no. (maxlin) =142.
     
[19] - lp100 h.w. change - line 1 of channel 1 must be set. changed
     .lines and .botom code  
[20] - fixed p 144 bug.  
[21] - fixed c 1 l 143 bug.   -- also added lp05 info.
[22] - lp100 h.w. change - channel 12 bottom must be defined for 
     lp05. therefore, maxchl increased to 12. also, .init code
     changed to define channel 12 bottom. also, messages m11,12
     added to .info.  
[23] - inserted warning message in .lpi to warn against
     attempting programmable changes to lpi for an lp05.  
[24] - fixed getsix to allow 0's in filename
[25] - fixed getdec bug -- 8 will be error for getoct, net terminator
char.
[26] - corrected error msgs to correspond to manual

[27] - fixed info to always output lp05, lp07 message
[30] - add zero command to clear a channel
     and new to clear entire vfu
     these are to facilitate non-standard vfu's
[31] - suppress lp05 warning in lpi 6 9 mar 1977
[32] - add type command
      lp05 lpi illegal, set channel 12 bot

VFU1.DOC -- V1(23)
January 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

MAKVFU provides support for the programmable  Direct  Access  Vertical
Format  Unit (DAVFU) feature on the LP100/LP07 Line Printer subsystem.
This feature relieves the computer operator from  the  time  consuming
manual  installation  of the proper vertical format using a paper tape
reader.  It also reduces the risk of running  a  print  job  with  the
incorrect vertical format.

The MAKVFU program produces a binary VFU file.   This  file  describes
the   vertical   formats   for  8  separate  channels.   Each  channel
corresponds to a  particular  non-printable  ASCII  character.   These
characters are called vertical control codes, and are related to the 8
channels as follows:

     Channel        Character           ASCII Value(octal)

     1              Form Feed           14
     2              Device Control 0    20
     3              Device Control 1    21
     4              Device Control 2    22
     5              Device Control 3    23
     6              Device Control 4    24
     7              Vertical Tab        13
     8              Line Feed           12


The MAKVFU commands permit the user to define  special  print  formats
for  each  of  the  8  channel/character  pairs.  These characters are
imbedded into text files sent  to  the  line  printer  to  format  the
printer output.

LPTSPL V102 (in GALAXY release 2)  will  automatically  load  a  DAVFU
based  on  a switch in the LPFORM.INI file.  The procedure for setting
this up will be documented in the  GALAXY  operator's  manual.   Until
this  software  ia  available,  the  DAVFU  can  be loaded with PIP by
typing:

     .R PIP
     *LPTn:=vfufile/I

In order for this to work however, the following patch must be applied
to the 6.03 lineprinter service routine (LPTSER):

     change:

     LPTREL:  MOVEI U,551000

     to:

     LPTREL:  MOVEI U,541000

     (i.e.  $Q-10000)

This is the first  release  of  MAKVFU.   This  release  has  no  know
deficiencies.   It  was developed under 6.03 and tested under 6.01 (as
of 7/9/76).

MAKVFU is documented in the following publications:
