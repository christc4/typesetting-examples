1.0  SUMMARY

RMS-20 V2 is a file- and  record-handling  subsystem  of  the  TOPS-20
Operating  System.   Program  interfaces are provided for using RMS-20
from MACRO and BLISS-36;  RMS may also be used from COBOL,  PASCAL-20,
and  BASIC+2.   Detailed  information  on RMS and use of RMS is in the
TOPS-20 RMS User's Guide.



1.1  Monitors

RMS-20 V2 requires TOPS-20 Release  5.1  or  later  and  KL  microcode
version 326 or later.



1.2  Required System Software

None.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


     1.  In addition to ASCII, SIXBIT, and EBCDIC  keys,  RMS  indexed
         files    may    now   have   integer,   floating-point,   and
         packed-decimal keys.  See the User's Guide for details.

     2.  RMS-20 V2 may be called into a nonzero section.  If the $INIT
         macro  is  executed from a nonzero section, SYS:XRMS.EXE will
         be loaded into the first  available  nonzero  section.   This
         requires the user program to be loaded with SYS:RMSINI.REL.

     3.  RMS-20 V2 supports RFA access to stream and LSA files.

     4.  RMS-20 V2 includes documentation  on  use  of  RMS  and  user
         interfaces to RMS for MACRO and BLISS programs.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
