SAMPLE MAIN PROGRAM FOR POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION - POLRG

PURPOSE
   (1) READ THE PROBLEM PARAMETER CARD FOR A POLYNOMIAL REGRES-
   SION, (2) CALL SUBROUTINES TO PERFORM THE ANALYSIS, (3)
   PRINT THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE
   TABLE FOR POLYNOMIALS OF SUCCESSIVELY INCREASING DEGREES,
   AND (4) OPTIONALLY PRINT THE TABLE OF RESIDUALS AND A PLOT
   OF Y VALUES AND Y ESTIMATES.

REMARKS
   THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS, N, MUST BE GREATER THAN M+1,
   WHERE M IS THE HIGHEST DEGREE POLYNOMIAL SPECIFIED.
   IF THERE IS NO REDUCTION IN THE RESIDUAL SUM OF SQUARES
   BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE DEGREES OF THE POLYNOMIALS, THE
   PROGRAM TERMINATES THE PROBLEM BEFORE COMPLETING THE ANALY-
   SIS FOR THE HIGHEST DEGREE POLYNOMIAL SPECIFIED.
