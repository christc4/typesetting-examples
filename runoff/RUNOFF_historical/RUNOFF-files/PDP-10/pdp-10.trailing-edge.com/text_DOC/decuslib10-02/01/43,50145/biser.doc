SUBROUTINE BISER

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE THE BISERIAL CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN TWO
   CONTINUOUS VARIABLES WHEN ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN ARTIFICIALLY
   DICHOTOMIZED.

USAGE
   CALL BISER (N,A,B,HI,ANS,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   N   - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
   A   - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE CONTINUOUS
	 VARIABLE
   B   - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE DICHOTOMIZED
	 VARIABLE
   HI  - INPUT - NUMERICAL CODE TO INDICATE THE HIGHER CATEGORY
	 OF THE DICHOTOMIZED VARIABLE.	ANY VALUE IN VECTOR B
	 EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN HI WILL BE CLASSIFIED INTO
	 THE HIGHER CATEGORY.
   ANS - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH 8 CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING
	 ANS(1) - MEAN OF VARIABLE A
	 ANS(2) - STANDARD DEVIATION OF VARIABLE A
	 ANS(3) - PROPORTION OF THE CASES IN THE HIGHER
		  CATEGORY OF VARIABLE B
	 ANS(4) - PROPORTION OF THE CASES IN THE LOWER
		  CATEGORY OF VARIABLE B
	 ANS(5) - MEAN OF VARIABLE A FOR THOSE CASES FALLING
		  INTO THE HIGHER CATEGORY OF VARIABLE B
	 ANS(6) - MEAN OF VARIABLE A FOR THOSE CASES FALLING
		  INTO THE LOWER CATEGORY OF VARIABLE B
	 ANS(7) - BISERIAL CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
	 ANS(8) - STANDARD ERROR OF BISERIAL CORRELATION
		  COEFFICIENT
   IER -  1, IF NO CASES ARE IN THE LOWER CATEGORY OF VARIABLE
	 B.
	 -1, IF ALL CASES ARE IN THE LOWER CATEGORY OF
	 VARIABLE B.
	 0, OTHERWISE.
	 IF IER IS NON-ZERO, ANS(I)=10**75,I=5,...,8.

REMARKS
   THE VALUES OF THE DICHOTOMIZED VARIABLE, B, MUST BE IN
   NUMERIC FORM.  THEY CANNOR BE SPECIFIED BY MEANS OF
   ALPHABETIC OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS.
