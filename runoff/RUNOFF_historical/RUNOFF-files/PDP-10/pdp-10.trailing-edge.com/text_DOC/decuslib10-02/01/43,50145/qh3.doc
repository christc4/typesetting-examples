SUBROUTINE QH3

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE INTEGRAL(EXP(-X*X)*FCT(X), SUMMED OVER X FROM
		       -INFINITY TO +INFINITY).

USAGE
   CALL QH3 (FCT,Y)
   PARAMETER FCT REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   FCT	  - THE NAME OF AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM USED.
   Y	  - THE RESULTING INTEGRAL VALUE.

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM FCT(X) MUST BE FURNISHED
   BY THE USER.

METHOD
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF 3-POINT GAUSSIAN-HERMITE
   QUADRATURE FORMULA, WHICH INTEGRATES EXACTLY WHENEVER
   FCT(X) IS A POLYNOMIAL UP TO DEGREE 5.
