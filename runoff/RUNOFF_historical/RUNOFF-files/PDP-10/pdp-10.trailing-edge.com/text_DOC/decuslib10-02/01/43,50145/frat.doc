SUBROUTINE FRAT

PURPOSE
   FRAT IS USED FOR HANDLING OF DATA AND FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTIONS
   WITH RATIONAL APPROXIMATION. IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF
   RATIONAL APPROXIMATION AND HAS NO MEANING INDEPENDENTLY

USAGE
   CALL FRAT(I,N,M,P,DATI,WGT,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   I	 - SUBSCRIPT OF CURRENT DATA POINT
   N	 - NUMBER OF ALL DATA POINTS
   M	 - NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTIONS USED
   P	 - ARRAY OF DIMENSION M+1 AT LEAST, WHICH CONTAINS
	   ON RETURN THE VALUES OF THE M FUNDAMENTAL
	   FUNCTIONS, FOLLOWED BY CURRENT FUNCTION VALUE
   DATI  - ARRAY CONTAINING GIVEN N ARGUMENTS, FOLLOWED
	   BY N FUNCTION VALUES AND FINALLY BY 1 RESPECTIVELY
	   N WEIGHT VALUES
   WGT	 - RESULTANT WEIGHT FACTOR USED FOR I-TH TERM
   IER	 - RESULTANT ERROR PARAMETER, COMBINED WITH INPUT
	   VALUES FOR CONTROL
	   IER(2) MEANS DIMENSION OF NUMERATOR
	   IER(3) MEANS DIMENSION OF DENOMINATOR
	   IER(1) IS USED AS RESULTANT ERROR PARAMETER,
	   IER(1) = 0 IN CASE OF NO ERRORS
	   IER(1) = 1 OTHERWISE (ZERO DENOMINATOR)

REMARKS
   VECTOR IER IS USED FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ARAT AND FRAT
