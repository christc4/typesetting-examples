		       TO INFINITY).

USAGE
   CALL QL6 (FCT,Y)
   PARAMETER FCT REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   FCT	  - THE NAME OF AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM USED.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM FCT(X) MUST BE FURNISHED
   BY THE USER.

METHOD
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF 6-POINT GAUSSIAN-LAGUERRE
   QUADRATURE FORMULA, WHICH INTEGRATES EXACTLY WHENEVER
   FCT(X) IS A POLYNOMIAL UP TO DEGREE 11.
