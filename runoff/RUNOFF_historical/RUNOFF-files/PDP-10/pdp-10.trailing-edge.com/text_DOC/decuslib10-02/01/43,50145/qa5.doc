PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE INTEGRAL(EXP(-X)*FCT(X)/SQRT(X), SUMMED OVER X
		       FROM 0 TO INFINITY).

USAGE
   CALL QA5 (FCT,Y)
   PARAMETER FCT REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   FCT	  - THE NAME OF AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM USED.
   Y	  - THE RESULTING INTEGRAL VALUE.

REMARKS

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM FCT(X) MUST BE FURNISHED
   BY THE USER.

METHOD
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF 5-POINT GENERALIZED GAUSSIAN-
   LAGUERRE QUADRATURE FORMULA, WHICH INTEGRATES EXACTLY,
   WHENEVER FCT(X) IS A POLYNOMIAL UP TO DEGREE 9.
   FOR REFERENCE, SEE
