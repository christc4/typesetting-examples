SUBROUTINE RCUT

PURPOSE
   PARTITION A MATRIX BETWEEN SPECIFIED ROWS TO FORM TWO
   RESULTANT MATRICES

USAGE
   CALL RCUT (A,L,R,S,N,M,MS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF INPUT MATRIX
   L - ROW OF A ABOVE WHICH PARTITIONING TAKES PLACE
   R - NAME OF MATRIX TO BE FORMED FROM UPPER PORTION OF A
   S - NAME OF MATRIX TO BE FORMED FROM LOWER PORTION OF A
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A
   MS  - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX S CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX S
   MATRIX R AND MATRIX S ARE ALWAYS GENERAL MATRICES

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   ELEMENTS OF MATRIX A ABOVE ROW L ARE MOVED TO FORM MATRIX R
   OF L-1 ROWS AND M COLUMNS. ELEMENTS OF MATRIX A IN ROW L
   AND BELOW ARE MOVED TO FORM MATRIX S OF N-L+1 ROWS AND M
   COLUMNS
