SUBROUTINE EXSMO

PURPOSE
   TO FIND THE TRIPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHED SERIES S OF THE
   GIVEN SERIES X.

USAGE
   CALL EXSMO (X,NX,AL,A,B,C,S)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   X	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH NX CONTAINING TIME SERIES
	   DATA WHICH IS TO BE EXPONENTIALLY SMOOTHED.
   NX	 - THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN X.
   AL	 - SMOOTHING CONSTANT, ALPHA.  AL MUST BE GREATER THAN
	   ZERO AND LESS THAN ONE.
   A,B,C - COEFFICIENTS OF THE PREDICTION EQUATION WHERE S IS
	   PREDICTED T PERIODS HENCE BY
			 A + B*T + C*T*T/2.
	   AS INPUT-- IF A=B=C=0, PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE INITIAL
	   VALUES.  IF AT LEAST ONE OF A,B,C IS NOT ZERO,
	   PROGRAM WILL TAKE GIVEN VALUES AS INITIAL VALUES.
	   AS OUTPUT-- A,B,C CONTAIN LATEST, UPDATED COEFFI-
	   CIENTS OF PREDICTION.
   S	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH NX CONTAINING TRIPLE
	   EXPONENTIALLY SMOOTHED TIME SERIES.
