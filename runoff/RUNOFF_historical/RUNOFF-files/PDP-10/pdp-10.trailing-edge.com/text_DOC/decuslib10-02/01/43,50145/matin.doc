METHOD
   SUBROUTINE ASSUMES THAT INPUT MATRIX CONSISTS OF PARAMETER
   CARD FOLLOWED BY DATA CARDS
   PARAMETER CARD HAS THE FOLLOWING FORMAT
     COL. 1- 2 BLANK
     COL. 3- 6 UP TO FOUR DIGIT IDENTIFICATION CODE
     COL. 7-10 NUMBER OF ROWS IN MATRIX
     COL.11-14 NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN MATRIX
     COL.15-16 STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX WHERE
	 0 - GENERAL MATRIX
	 1 - SYMMETRIC MATRIX
	 2 - DIAGONAL MATRIX
   DATA CARDS ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE SEVEN FIELDS OF TEN COLUMNS
   EACH.  DECIMAL POINT MAY APPEAR ANYWHERE IN A FIELD.  IF NO
   DECIMAL POINT IS INCLUDED, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DECIMAL
   POINT IS AT THE END OF THE 10 COLUMN FIELD. NUMBER IN EACH
   FIELD MAY BE PRECEDED BY BLANKS.  DATA ELEMENTS MUST BE
   PUNCHED BY ROW.  A ROW MAY CONTINUE FROM CARD TO CARD.
   HOWEVER EACH NEW ROW MUST START IN THE FIRST FIELD OF THE
   NEXT CARD.  ONLY THE UPPER TRIANGULAR PORTION OF A SYMMETRIC
   OR THE DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF A DIAGONAL MATRIX ARE CONTAINED
   ON DATA CARDS.  THE FIRST ELEMENT OF EACH NEW ROW WILL BE
   THE DIAGONAL ELEMENT FOR A MATRIX WITH  SYMMETRIC OR
   DIAGONAL STORAGE MODE. COLUMNS 71-80 OF DATA CARDS MAY BE
   USED FOR IDENTIFICATION, SEQUENCE NUMBERING, ETC..
   THE LAST DATA CARD FOR ANY MATRIX MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A CARD
   WITH A 9 PUNCH IN COLUMN 1.
