SUBROUTINE QL4

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE INTEGRAL(EXP(-X)*FCT(X), SUMMED OVER X FROM 0
		       TO INFINITY).

USAGE
   CALL QL4 (FCT,Y)
   PARAMETER FCT REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   FCT	  - THE NAME OF AN EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM USED.
   Y	  - THE RESULTING INTEGRAL VALUE.

REMARKS

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM FCT(X) MUST BE FURNISHED
   BY THE USER.

METHOD
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF 4-POINT GAUSSIAN-LAGUERRE
   QUADRATURE FORMULA, WHICH INTEGRATES EXACTLY WHENEVER
   FCT(X) IS A POLYNOMIAL UP TO DEGREE 7.
