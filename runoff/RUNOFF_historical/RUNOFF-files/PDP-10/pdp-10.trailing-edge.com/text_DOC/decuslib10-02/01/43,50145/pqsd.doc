PURPOSE
   PERFORM QUADRATIC SYNTHETIC DIVISION

USAGE
   CALL PQSD(A,B,P,Q,X,IDIMX)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A	 - COEFFICIENT OF Z IN REMAINDER (CALCULATED)
   B	 - CONSTANT TERM IN REMAINDER (CALCULATED)
   P	 - COEFFICIENT OF Z IN QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL
   Q	 - CONSTANT TERM IN QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL
   X	 - COEFFICIENT VECTOR FOR GIVEN POLYNOMIAL, ORDERED
	   FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   POLYNOMIAL IS DIVIDED BY THE QUADRATIC Z**2-P*Z-Q GIVING
