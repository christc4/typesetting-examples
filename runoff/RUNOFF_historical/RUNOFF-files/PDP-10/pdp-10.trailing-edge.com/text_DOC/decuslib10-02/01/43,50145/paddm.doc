SUBROUTINE PADDM

PURPOSE
   ADD COEFFICIENTS OF ONE POLYNOMIAL TO THE PRODUCT OF A
   FACTOR BY COEFFICIENTS OF ANOTHER POLYNOMIAL

USAGE
   CALL PADDM(Z,IDIMZ,X,IDIMX,FACT,Y,IDIMY)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Z	 - VECTOR OF RESULTANT COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM
	   SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMZ - DIMENSION OF Z (CALCULATED)
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR FIRST POLYNOMIAL, ORDERED
	   FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X (DEGREE IS IDIMX-1)
   FACT  - FACTOR TO BE MULTIPLIED BY VECTOR Y
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR SECOND POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y (DEGREE IS IDIMY-1)

REMARKS
   VECTOR Z MAY BE IN SAME LOCATION AS EITHER VECTOR X OR
   VECTOR Y ONLY IF THE DIMENSION OF THAT VECTOR IS NOT LESS
   THAN THE OTHER INPUT VECTOR
   THE RESULTANT POLYNOMIAL MAY HAVE TRAILING ZERO COEFFICIENTS

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF RESULTANT VECTOR IDIMZ IS CALCULATED AS THE
   LARGER OF THE TWO INPUT VECTOR DIMENSIONS. COEFFICIENT IN
   VECTOR X IS THEN ADDED TO COEFFICIENT IN VECTOR Y MULTIPLIED
   BY FACTOR TO FORM Z.
