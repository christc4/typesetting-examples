SUBROUTINE PMPY

PURPOSE
   MULTIPLY TWO POLYNOMIALS

USAGE
   CALL PMPY(Z,IDIMZ,X,IDIMX,Y,IDIMY)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Z	 - VECTOR OF RESULTANT COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM
	   SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMZ - DIMENSION OF Z (CALCULATED)
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR FIRST POLYNOMIAL, ORDERED
	   FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X (DEGREE IS IDIMX-1)
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR SECOND POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y (DEGREE IS IDIMY-1)

REMARKS
   Z CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS X
   Z CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS Y

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF Z IS CALCULATED AS IDIMX+IDIMY-1
   THE COEFFICIENTS OF Z ARE CALCULATED AS SUM OF PRODUCTS
   OF COEFFICIENTS OF X AND Y , WHOSE EXPONENTS ADD UP TO THE
   CORRESPONDING EXPONENT OF Z.
