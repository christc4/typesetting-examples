SUBROUTINE CTAB

PURPOSE
   TABULATE COLUMNS OF A MATRIX TO FORM A SUMMARY MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL CTAB(A,B,R,S,N,M,MS,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH M CONTAINING KEY
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX CONTAINING SUMMARY OF COLUMN DATA.
       IT IS INITIALLY SET TO ZERO BY THIS SUBROUTINE.
   S - NAME OF OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH L+1 CONTAINING COUNTS
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A AND R
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A
   L - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN R
   MS  - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL

REMARKS
   MATRIX R IS ALWAYS A GENERAL MATRIX

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC
   CADD

METHOD
   COLUMNS OF DATA IN MATRIX A ARE TABULATED BASED ON THE KEY
   CONTAINED IN VECTOR B. THE FLOATING POINT NUMBER IN B(I) IS
   TRUNCATED TO FORM J. THE ITH COLUMN OF A IS ADDED TO THE JTH
   COLUMN OF MATRIX R AND ONE IS ADDED TO S(J). IF THE VALUE OF
   J IS NOT BETWEEN 1 AND L, ONE IS ADDED TO S(L+1)
   UPON COMPLETION, THE OUTPUT MATRIX R CONTAINS A SUMMARY OF
   COLUMN DATA AS SPECIFIED BY VECTOR B. EACH ELEMENT IN VECTOR
   S CONTAINS A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF A USED TO
   FORM R. ELEMENT S(L+1) CONTAINS THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF A
   NOT INCLUDED IN R AS A RESULT OF J BEING LESS THAN ONE OR
   GREATER THAN L.
