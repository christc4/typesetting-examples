SUBROUTINE SRATE

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS SURVIVING, THE
   SURVIVAL RATES AND THE STANDARD ERRORS FOR SUCCESSIVELY
   REDUCED TIME PERIODS.  THE SURVIVAL RATE IS COMPUTED FOR
   EACH OF K PERIODS, WHERE K IS A CONSTANT TO BE SPECIFIED AND
   IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO N (WHERE N = TOTAL NUMBER OF
   PERIODS).

USAGE
   CALL SRATE (N,K,X,IE)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   N - THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERIODS AFTER TREATMENT OR DIAGNOSIS
   K - THE SPECIFIED PERIOD UP TO WHICH SURVIVAL RATES ARE TO
       BE CALCULATED
   X - AN INPUT AND OUTPUT MATRIX (N X 9) CONTAINING THE
       FOLLOWING INFORMATION
       FOR INPUT--STORED IN THE N ROWS OF EACH COLUMN
	  COL 1 - NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ALIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF
		  PERIOD
	  COL 2 - NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WHICH DIED DURING THE
		  PERIOD
	  COL 3 - NUMBER OF SUBJECTS LOST TO FOLLOW-UP DURING
		  THE PERIOD
	  COL 4 - NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WITHDRAWN ALIVE DURING THE
		  PERIOD
	    FOR OUTPUT--STORED IN THE FIRST K ROWS OF EACH
	    COLUMN
	  COL 5 - EFFECTIVE NUMBER EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DYING
	  COL 6 - PROPORTION WHO DIED DURING THE PERIOD
	  COL 7 - PROPORTION WHO SURVIVED DURING THE PERIOD
	  COL 8 - SURVIAL RATE
	  COL 9 - STANDARD ERROR OF THE SURVIVAL RATE
   IE- 1, IF K IS NOT IN THE CLOSED INTERVAL (0,N).
       2, IF THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ALIVE AT THE BEGINNING
       OF PERIOD I IS LESS THAN THE SUM OF THOSE WHICH DIED,
       WERE LOST, OR WERE WITHDRAWN DURING PERIOD I (I=1,...N)
       3, IF THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WHICH DIED, WERE LOST, OR
       WERE WITHDRAWN IN PERIOD I IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER
       ALIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF PERIOD I LESS THE NUMBER
       ALIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF PERIOD I + 1 (I=1,...N-1)

REMARKS
   IF THE SUBJECTS IN A GIVEN GROUP ARE ALL DIAGNOSED OR
   TREATED AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONSTANT K MAY BE SET EQUAL TO
   N .	IF THE SUBJECTS IN A GIVEN GOUP ENTER THE STUDY AT
   VARYING TIMES, K CAN BE NO GREATER THAN N-1.
