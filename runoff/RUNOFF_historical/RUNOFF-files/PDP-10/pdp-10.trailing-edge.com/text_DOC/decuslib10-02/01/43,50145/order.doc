SUBROUTINE ORDER

PURPOSE
   CONSTRUCT FROM A LARGER MATRIX OF CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS
   A SUBSET MATRIX OF INTERCORRELATIONS AMONG INDEPENDENT
   VARIABLES AND A VECTOR OF INTERCORRELATIONS OF INDEPENDENT
   VARIABLES WITH DEPENDENT VARIABLE.  THIS SUBROUTINE IS
   NORMALLY USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE AND POLYNOMIAL
   REGRESSION ANALYSES.

USAGE
   CALL ORDER (M,R,NDEP,K,ISAVE,RX,RY)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   M	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES AND ORDER OF MATRIX R.
   R	 - INPUT MATRIX CONTAINING CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS.
	   THIS SUBROUTINE EXPECTS ONLY UPPER TRIANGULAR
	   PORTION OF THE SYMMETRIC MATRIX TO BE STORED (BY
	   COLUMN) IN R.  (STORAGE MODE OF 1)
   NDEP  - THE SUBSCRIPT NUMBER OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE.
   K	 - NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES TO BE INCLUDED
	   IN THE FORTHCOMING REGRESSION. K MUST BE GREATER
	   THAN OR EQUAL TO 1.
   ISAVE - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K+1 CONTAINING, IN ASCENDING
	   ORDER, THE SUBSCRIPT NUMBERS OF K INDEPENDENT
	   VARIABLES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE FORTHCOMING REGRES-
	   SION.
	   UPON RETURNING TO THE CALLING ROUTINE, THIS VECTOR
	   CONTAINS, IN ADDITION, THE SUBSCRIPT NUMBER OF
	   THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN K+1 POSITION.
   RX	 - OUTPUT MATRIX (K X K) CONTAINING INTERCORRELATIONS
	   AMONG INDEPENDENT VARIABLES TO BE USED IN FORTH-
	   COMING REGRESSION.
   RY	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING INTERCORRELA-
	   TIONS OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH DEPENDENT
	   VARIABLES.

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   FROM THE SUBSCRIPT NUMBERS OF THE VARIABLES TO BE INCLUDED
   IN THE FORTHCOMING REGRESSION, THE SUBROUTINE CONSTRUCTS THE
   MATRIX RX AND THE VECTOR RY.
