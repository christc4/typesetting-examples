SUBROUTINE MPRD

PURPOSE
   MULTIPLY TWO MATRICES TO FORM A RESULTANT MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL MPRD(A,B,R,N,M,MSA,MSB,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF FIRST INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF SECOND INPUT MATRIX
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A AND R
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A AND ROWS IN B
   MSA - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL
   MSB - SAME AS MSA EXCEPT FOR MATRIX B
   L - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN B AND R

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRICES A OR B
   NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF MATRIX A MUST BE EQUAL TO NUMBER OF ROW
   OF MATRIX B

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   THE M BY L MATRIX B IS PREMULTIPLIED BY THE N BY M MATRIX A
   AND THE RESULT IS STORED IN THE N BY L MATRIX R. THIS IS A
   ROW INTO COLUMN PRODUCT.
   THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE STORAGE MODE OF THE OUTPUT
   MATRIX FOR ALL COMBINATIONS OF INPUT MATRICES
		 A		  B		   R
