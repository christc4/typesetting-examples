SUBROUTINE TPRD

PURPOSE
   TRANSPOSE A MATRIX AND POSTMULTIPLY BY ANOTHER TO FORM
   A RESULTANT MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL TPRD(A,B,R,N,M,MSA,MSB,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF FIRST INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF SECOND INPUT MATRIX
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A AND B
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A AND ROWS IN R
   MSA - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL
   MSB - SAME AS MSA EXCEPT FOR MATRIX B
   L - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN B AND R

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRICES A OR B

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   MATRIX TRANSPOSE OF A IS NOT ACTUALLY CALCULATED. INSTEAD,
   ELEMENTS IN MATRIX A ARE TAKEN COLUMNWISE RATHER THAN
   ROWWISE FOR MULTIPLICATION BY MATRIX B.
   THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE STORAGE MODE OF THE OUTPUT
   MATRIX FOR ALL COMBINATIONS OF INPUT MATRICES
		 A		  B		   R
