SUBROUTINE TETRA

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE A TETRACHORIC CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN TWO
   VARIABLES WHERE DATA IN BOTH VARIABLES HAVE BEEN REDUCED
   ARTIFICIALLY TO TWO CATEGORIES.

USAGE
   CALL TETRA (N,U,V,HU,HV,R,RS,IE)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   N  - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
   U  - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE FIRST VARIABLE
	REDUCED TO TWO CATEGORIES
   V  - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE SECOND VARIABLE
	REDUCED TO TWO CATEGORIES
   HU - INPUT NUMERICAL CODE INDICATING THE HIGHER CATEGORY OF
	THE FIRST VARIABLE.  IF ANY VALUE OF VARIABLE U IS
	EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN HU, IT WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS
	THE HIGHER CATEGORY, OTHERWISE AS THE LOWER CATEGORY.
   HV - SAME AS HU EXCEPT THAT HV IS FOR THE SECOND VARIABLE.
   R  - TETRACHORIC CORRELATION COMPUTED
   RS - STANDARD ERROR OF TETRACHORIC CORRELATION COMPUTED
   IE - ERROR CODE
	0 - NO ERROR
	1 - UNABLE TO COMPUTE A TETRACHORIC CORRELATION DUE TO
	    THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE CELL SHOWS ZERO FRE-
	    QUENCY IN THE 2X2 CONTINGENCY TABLE CONSTRUCTED
	    FROM INPUT DATA.  IN THIS CASE, R AND RS ARE SET
	    TO 10**75.	(SEE GUILFORD, 1956)
	2 - THE ROOT SOLVER GIVES MULTIPLE ROOTS, OR NO ROOTS,
	    R, IN THE INTERVAL (-1,1) INCLUSIVE. R AND RS ARE
	    SET TO 10**75.
	3 - UNABLE TO COMPUTE A SATISFACTORY VALUE OF TETRA-
	    CHORIC CORRELATION USING NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD OF
	    APPROXIMATION TO THE ROOT OF THE EQUATION.	R AND
	    RS ARE SET TO 10**75.  SEE SUBROUTINE POLRT ERROR
	    INDICATORS.
	4 - HIGH ORDER COEFFICIENT OF THE POLYNOMIAL IS ZERO.
	    SEE SUBROUTINE POLRT ERROR INDICATORS.

REMARKS
   VALUES OF VARIABLES U AND V MUST BE NUMERICAL, AND
   ALPHABETIC AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS MUST NOT BE USED.
   FOR A DEPENDABLE RESULT FOR TETRACHORIC CORRELATION,
   IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT N BE AT LEAST 200 OR GREATER.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NDTRI
   POLRT--THIS POLYNOMIAL ROOT ROUTINE WAS SELECTED BECAUSE OF
	  ITS SMALL STORAGE REQUIREMENT.  OTHER SSP ROUTINES
	  WHICH COULD REPLACE POLRT ARE PRQD AND PRBM.	THEIR
	  USE WOULD REQUIRE MODIFICATION OF TETRA.
