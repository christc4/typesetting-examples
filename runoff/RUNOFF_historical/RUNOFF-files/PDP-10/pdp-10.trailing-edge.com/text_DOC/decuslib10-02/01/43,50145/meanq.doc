SUBROUTINE MEANQ

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE SUM OF SQUARES, DEGREES OF FREEDOM, AND MEAN SQUARE
   USING THE MEAN SQUARE OPERATOR.  THIS SUBROUTINE NORMALLY
   FOLLOWS CALLS TO AVDAT AND AVCAL SUBROUTINES IN THE PER-
   FORMANCE OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR A COMPLETE FACTORIAL
   DESIGN.

USAGE
   CALL MEANQ (K,LEVEL,X,GMEAN,SUMSQ,NDF,SMEAN,MSTEP,KOUNT,
		LASTS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   K	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES (FACTORS). K MUST BE .GT. ONE.
   LEVEL - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING LEVELS (CATE-
	   GORIES) WITHIN EACH VARIABLE.
   X	 - INPUT VECTOR CONTAINING THE RESULT OF THE SIGMA AND
	   DELTA OPERATORS. THE LENGTH OF X IS
	   (LEVEL(1)+1)*(LEVEL(2)+1)*...*(LEVEL(K)+1).
   GMEAN - OUTPUT VARIABLE CONTAINING GRAND MEAN.
   SUMSQ - OUTPUT VECTOR CONTAINING SUMS OF SQUARES.  THE
	   LENGTH OF SUMSQ IS 2 TO THE K-TH POWER MINUS ONE,
	   (2**K)-1.
   NDF	 - OUTPUT VECTOR CONTAINING DEGREES OF FREEDOM.  THE
	   LENGTH OF NDF IS 2 TO THE K-TH POWER MINUS ONE,
	   (2**K)-1.
   SMEAN - OUTPUT VECTOR CONTAINING MEAN SQUARES.  THE
	   LENGTH OF SMEAN IS 2 TO THE K-TH POWER MINUS ONE,
	   (2**K)-1.
   MSTEP - WORKING VECTOR OF LENGTH K.
   KOUNT - WORKING VECTOR OF LENGTH K.
   LASTS - WORKING VECTOR OF LENGTH K.

REMARKS
   THIS SUBROUTINE MUST FOLLOW SUBROUTINE AVCAL

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE TECHNIQUE DISCUSSED BY H. O.
   HARTLEY IN 'MATHEMATICAL METHODS FOR DIGITAL COMPUTERS',
   EDITED BY A. RALSTON AND H. WILF, JOHN WILEY AND SONS,
   1962, CHAPTER 20.
