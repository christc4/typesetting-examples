SUBROUTINE SRANK

PURPOSE
   TEST CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES BY MEANS OF SPEARMAN
   RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT

USAGE
   CALL SRANK(A,B,R,N,RS,T,NDF,NR)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A   - INPUT VECTOR OF N OBSERVATIONS FOR FIRST VARIABLE
   B   - INPUT VECTOR OF N OBSERVATIONS FOR SECOND VARIABLE
   R   - OUTPUT VECTOR FOR RANKED DATA, LENGTH IS 2*N. SMALLEST
	 OBSERVATION IS RANKED 1, LARGEST IS RANKED N. TIES
	 ARE ASSIGNED AVERAGE OF TIED RANKS.
   N   - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
   RS  - SPEARMAN RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (OUTPUT)
   T   - TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE OF RS (OUTPUT)
   NDF - NUMBER OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM (OUTPUT)
   NR  - CODE, 0 FOR UNRANKED DATA IN A AND B, 1 FOR RANKED
	 DATA IN A AND B (INPUT)

REMARKS
   T IS SET TO ZERO IF N IS LESS THAN TEN
