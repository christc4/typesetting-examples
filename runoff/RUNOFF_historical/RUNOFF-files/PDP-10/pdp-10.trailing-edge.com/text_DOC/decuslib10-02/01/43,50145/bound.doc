SUBROUTINE BOUND

PURPOSE
   SELECT FROM A SET (OR A SUBSET) OF OBSERVATIONS THE NUMBER
   OF OBSERVATIONS UNDER, BETWEEN AND OVER TWO GIVEN BOUNDS
   FOR EACH VARIABLE

USAGE
   CALL BOUND (A,S,BLO,BHI,UNDER,BETW,OVER,NO,NV,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A	 - OBSERVATION MATRIX, NO BY NV
   S	 - VECTOR INDICATING SUBSET OF A. ONLY THOSE
	   OBSERVATIONS WITH A NON-ZERO S(J) ARE CONSIDERED.
	   VECTOR LENGTH IS NO.
   BLO	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LOWER BOUNDS ON ALL VARIABLES.
	   VECTOR LENGTH IS NV.
   BHI	 - INPUT VECTOR OF UPPER BOUNDS ON ALL VARIABLES.
	   VECTOR LENGTH IS NV.
   UNDER - OUTPUT VECTOR INDICATING, FOR EACH VARIABLE, NUMBER
	   OF OBSERVATIONS UNDER LOWER BOUNDS. VECTOR LENGTH
	   IS NV.
   BETW  - OUTPUT VECTOR INDICATING, FOR EACH VARIABLE, NUMBER
	   OF OBSERVATIONS EQUAL TO OR BETWEEN LOWER AND UPPER
	   BOUNDS. VECTOR LENGTH IS NV.
   OVER  - OUTPUT VECTOR INDICATING, FOR EACH VARIABLE, NUMBER
	   OF OBSERVATIONS OVER UPPER BOUNDS. VECTOR LENGTH
	   IS NV.
   NO	 - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
   NV	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES FOR EACH OBSERVATION
   IER	 - ZERO, IF NO ERROR.
	 - 1, IF LOWER BOUND IS GREATER THAN THE UPPER BOUND
	   FOR SOME VARIABLE

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   EACH ROW (OBSERVATION) OF MATRIX A WITH CORRESPONDING
   NON-ZERO ELEMENT IN S VECTOR IS TESTED. OBSERVATIONS ARE
   COMPARED WITH SPECIFIED LOWER AND UPPER VARIABLE BOUNDS AND
   A COUNT IS KEPT IN VECTORS UNDER, BETWEEN, AND OVER.
