SUBROUTINE SUBMX

PURPOSE
   BASED ON VECTOR S DERIVED FROM SUBROUTINE SUBST OR ABSNT,
   THIS SUBROUTINE COPIES FROM A LARGER MATRIX OF OBSERVATION
   DATA A SUBSET MATRIX OF THOSE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE
   SATISFIED CERTAIN CONDITION.  THIS SUBROUTINE IS NORMALLY
   USED PRIOR TO STATISTICAL ANALYSES (E.G., MULTIPLE REGRES-
   SION, FACTOR ANALYSIS).

USAGE
   CALL SUBMX (A,D,S,NO,NV,N)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A  - INPUT MATRIX OF OBSERVATIONS, NO BY NV.
   D  - OUTPUT MATRIX OF OBSERVATIONS, N BY NV.
   S -	INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH NO CONTAINING THE CODES DERIVED
	FROM SUBROUTINE SUBST OR ABSNT.
   NO - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS. NO MUST BE > OR = TO 1.
   NV - NUMBER OF VARIABLES. NV MUST BE > OR = TO 1.
   N  - OUTPUT VARIABLE CONTAINING THE NUMBER OF NON-ZERO CODES
	IN VECTOR S.

REMARKS
   MATRIX D CAN BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   IF S(I) CONTAINS A NON-ZERO CODE, I-TH OBSERVATION IS
   COPIED FROM THE INPUT MATRIX TO THE OUTPUT MATRIX.
