SUBROUTINE PCLD

PURPOSE
   SHIFT OF ORIGIN (COMPLETE LINEAR SYNTHETIC DIVISION)

USAGE
   CALL PCLD(X,IDIMX,U)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO
	   LARGEST POWER. IT IS REPLACED BY VECTOR OF
	   TRANSFORMED COEFFICIENTS.
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X
   U	 - SHIFT PARAMETER

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   COEFFICIENT VECTOR X(I) OF POLYNOMIAL P(Z) IS TRANSFORMED
   SUCH THAT Q(Z)=P(Z-U) WHERE Q(Z) DENOTES THE POLYNOMIAL
   WITH TRANSFORMED COEFFICIENT VECTOR.
