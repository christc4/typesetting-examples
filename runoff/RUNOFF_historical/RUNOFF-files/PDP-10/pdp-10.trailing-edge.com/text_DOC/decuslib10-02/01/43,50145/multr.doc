SUBROUTINE MULTR

PURPOSE
   PERFORM A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR A
   DEPENDENT VARIABLE AND A SET OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES.  THIS
   SUBROUTINE IS NORMALLY USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE
   AND POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION ANALYSES.

USAGE
   CALL MULTR (N,K,XBAR,STD,D,RX,RY,ISAVE,B,SB,T,ANS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   N	 - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS.
   K	 - NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN THIS REGRESSION.
   XBAR  - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH M CONTAINING MEANS OF ALL
	   VARIABLES. M IS NUMBER OF VARIABLES IN OBSERVATIONS.
   STD	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH M CONTAINING STANDARD DEVI-
	   ATIONS OF ALL VARIABLES.
   D	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH M CONTAINING THE DIAGONAL OF
	   THE MATRIX OF SUMS OF CROSS-PRODUCTS OF DEVIATIONS
	   FROM MEANS FOR ALL VARIABLES.
   RX	 - INPUT MATRIX (K X K) CONTAINING THE INVERSE OF
	   INTERCORRELATIONS AMONG INDEPENDENT VARIABLES.
   RY	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING INTERCORRELA-
	   TIONS OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH DEPENDENT
	   VARIABLE.
   ISAVE - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K+1 CONTAINING SUBSCRIPTS OF
	   INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN ASCENDING ORDER.  THE
	   SUBSCRIPT OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS STORED IN
	   THE LAST, K+1, POSITION.
   B	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING REGRESSION
	   COEFFICIENTS.
   SB	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING STANDARD
	   DEVIATIONS OF REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS.
   T	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING T-VALUES.
   ANS	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH 10 CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING
	   INFORMATION..
	   ANS(1)  INTERCEPT
	   ANS(2)  MULTIPLE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT
	   ANS(3)  STANDARD ERROR OF ESTIMATE
	   ANS(4)  SUM OF SQUARES ATTRIBUTABLE TO REGRES-
		   SION (SSAR)
	   ANS(5)  DEGREES OF FREEDOM ASSOCIATED WITH SSAR
	   ANS(6)  MEAN SQUARE OF SSAR
	   ANS(7)  SUM OF SQUARES OF DEVIATIONS FROM REGRES-
		   SION (SSDR)
	   ANS(8)  DEGREES OF FREEDOM ASSOCIATED WITH SSDR
	   ANS(9)  MEAN SQUARE OF SSDR
	   ANS(10) F-VALUE

REMARKS
   N MUST BE GREATER THAN K+1.
