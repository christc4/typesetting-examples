SUBROUTINE TAB1

PURPOSE
   TABULATE FOR ONE VARIABLE IN AN OBSERVATION MATRIX (OR A
   MATRIX SUBSET), THE FREQUENCY AND PERCENT FREQUENCY OVER
   GIVEN CLASS INTERVALS. IN ADDITION, CALCULATE FOR THE SAME
   VARIABLE THE TOTAL, AVERAGE, STANDARD DEVIATION, MINIMUM,
   AND MAXIMUM.

USAGE
   CALL TAB1(A,S,NOVAR,UBO,FREQ,PCT,STATS,NO,NV)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A	 - OBSERVATION MATRIX, NO BY NV
   S	 - INPUT VECTOR GIVING SUBSET OF A. ONLY THOSE
	   OBSERVATIONS WITH A CORRESPONDING NON-ZERO S(J) ARE
	   CONSIDERED. VECTOR LENGTH IS NO.
   NOVAR - THE VARIABLE TO BE TABULATED. NOVAR MUST BE GREATER
	   THAN OR EQUAL TO 1 AND LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO NV.
	   AND UPPER LIMIT OF VARIABLE TO BE TABULATED
	   IN UBO(1), UBO(2) AND UBO(3) RESPECTIVELY. IF
	   LOWER LIMIT IS EQUAL TO UPPER LIMIT, THE PROGRAM
	   USES THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES OF THE VARIABLE.
	   NUMBER OF INTERVALS, UBO(2), MUST INCLUDE TWO CELLS
	   FOR VALUES UNDER AND ABOVE LIMITS. VECTOR LENGTH
	   IS 3.
   FREQ  - OUTPUT VECTOR OF FREQUENCIES. VECTOR LENGTH IS
	   UBO(2).
   PCT	 - OUTPUT VECTOR OF RELATIVE FREQUENCIES. VECTOR
	   LENGTH IS UBO(2).
   STATS - OUTPUT VECTOR OF SUMMARY STATISTICS, I.E., TOTAL,
	   AVERAGE, STANDARD DEVIATION, MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM.
	   VECTOR LENGTH IS 5. IF S IS NULL, THEN TOTAL,AVERAGE
	   AND STANDARD DEVIATION = 0, MIN=1.E75 AND MAX=-1.E75
   NO	 - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS. NO MUST BE > OR = TO 1
   NV	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES FOR EACH OBSERVATION. NV MUST
	   BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1.

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE INTERVAL SIZE IS CALCULATED FROM THE GIVEN INFORMATION
   OR OPTIONALLY FROM THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES FOR
   VARIABLE NOVAR. THE FREQUENCIES AND PERCENT FREQUENCIES ARE
   THEN CALCULATED ALONG WITH SUMMARY STATISTICS.
   THE DIVISOR FOR STANDARD DEVIATION IS ONE LESS THAN THE
   NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS USED.
