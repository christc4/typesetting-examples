SUBROUTINE MOMEN

PURPOSE
   TO FIND THE THE FIRST FOUR MOMENTS FOR GROUPED DATA ON
   EQUAL CLASS INTERVALS.

USAGE
   CALL MOMEN (F,UBO,NOP,ANS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   F   - GROUPED DATA (FREQUENCIES).  GIVEN AS A VECTOR OF
	 LENGTH (UBO(3)-UBO(1))/UBO(2)
   UBO - 3 CELL VECTOR, UBO(1) IS LOWER BOUND AND UBO(3) UPPER
	 BOUND ON DATA.  UBO(2) IS CLASS INTERVAL.  NOTE THAT
	 UBO(3) MUST BE GREATER THAN UBO(1).
   NOP - OPTION PARAMETER.  IF NOP = 1, ANS(1) = MEAN.	IF
	 NOP = 2, ANS(2) = SECOND MOMENT.  IF NOP = 3, ANS(3) =
	 THIRD MOMENT.	IF NOP = 4, ANS(4) = FOURTH MOMENT.
	 IF NOP = 5, ALL FOUR MOMENTS ARE FILLED IN.
   ANS - OUTPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH 4 INTO WHICH MOMENTS ARE PUT.

REMARKS
   NOTE THAT THE FIRST MOMENT IS NOT CENTRAL BUT THE VALUE OF
   THE MEAN ITSELF.  THE MEAN IS ALWAYS CALCULATED.  MOMENTS
   ARE BIASED AND NOT CORRECTED FOR GROUPING.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
