DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A  - NAME OF INPUT MATRIX
   R  - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   L  - ROW OF A WHERE FIRST ELEMENT OF R CAN BE FOUND
   K  - COLUMN OF A WHERE FIRST ELEMENT OF R CAN BE FOUND
   NR - NUMBER OF ROWS TO BE COPIED INTO R
   MR - NUMBER OF COLUMNS TO BE COPIED INTO R
   NA - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A
   MA - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A
   MS  - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX R IS ALWAYS A GENERAL MATRIX

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   MATRIX R IS FORMED BY COPYING A PORTION OF MATRIX A. THIS
   IS DONE BY EXTRACTING NR ROWS AND MR COLUMNS OF MATRIX A,
   STARTING WITH ELEMENT AT ROW L, COLUMN K
