SUBROUTINE MINV

PURPOSE
   INVERT A MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL MINV(A,N,D,L,M)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - INPUT MATRIX, DESTROYED IN COMPUTATION AND REPLACED BY
       RESULTANT INVERSE.
   N - ORDER OF MATRIX A
   D - RESULTANT DETERMINANT
   L - WORK VECTOR OF LENGTH N
   M - WORK VECTOR OF LENGTH N

REMARKS
   MATRIX A MUST BE A GENERAL MATRIX

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE STANDARD GAUSS-JORDAN METHOD IS USED. THE DETERMINANT
   IS ALSO CALCULATED. A DETERMINANT OF ZERO INDICATES THAT
   THE MATRIX IS SINGULAR.
