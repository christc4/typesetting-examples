SUBROUTINE LOC

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE A VECTOR SUBSCRIPT FOR AN ELEMENT IN A MATRIX OF
   SPECIFIED STORAGE MODE

USAGE
   CALL LOC (I,J,IR,N,M,MS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   I   - ROW NUMBER OF ELEMENT
   J   - COLUMN NUMBER	OF ELEMENT
   IR  - RESULTANT VECTOR SUBSCRIPT
   N   - NUMBER OF ROWS IN MATRIX
   M   - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN MATRIX
   MS  - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   MS=0   SUBSCRIPT IS COMPUTED FOR A MATRIX WITH N*M ELEMENTS
	  IN STORAGE (GENERAL MATRIX)
   MS=1   SUBSCRIPT IS COMPUTED FOR A MATRIX WITH N*(N+1)/2 IN
	  STORAGE (UPPER TRIANGLE OF SYMMETRIC MATRIX). IF
	  ELEMENT IS IN LOWER TRIANGULAR PORTION, SUBSCRIPT IS
	  CORRESPONDING ELEMENT IN UPPER TRIANGLE.
   MS=2   SUBSCRIPT IS COMPUTED FOR A MATRIX WITH N ELEMENTS
	  IN STORAGE (DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF DIAGONAL MATRIX).
	  IF ELEMENT IS NOT ON DIAGONAL (AND THEREFORE NOT IN
	  STORAGE), IR IS SET TO ZERO.
