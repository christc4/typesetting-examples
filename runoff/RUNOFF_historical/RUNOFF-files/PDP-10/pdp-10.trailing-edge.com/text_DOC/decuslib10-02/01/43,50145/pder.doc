SUBROUTINE PDER

PURPOSE
   FIND DERIVATIVE OF A POLYNOMIAL

USAGE
   CALL PDER(Y,IDIMY,X,IDIMX)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR DERIVATIVE, ORDERED FROM
	   SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y (EQUAL TO IDIMX-1)
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR ORIGINAL POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF Y IS SET AT DIMENSION OF X LESS ONE. DERIVATIVE
   IS THEN CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING COEFFICIENTS BY THEIR
   RESPECTIVE EXPONENTS.
