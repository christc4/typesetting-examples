SUBROUTINE DMATX

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE MEANS OF VARIABLES IN EACH GROUP AND A POOLED
   DISPERSION MATRIX FOR ALL THE GROUPS. NORMALLY THIS SUB-
   ROUTINE IS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS.

USAGE
   CALL DMATX (K,M,N,X,XBAR,D,CMEAN)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   K	 - NUMBER OF GROUPS
   M	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES (MUST BE THE SAME FOR ALL
	   GROUPS).
   N	 - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING SAMPLE SIZES OF
	   GROUPS.
   X	 - INPUT VECTOR CONTAINING DATA IN THE MANNER EQUIVA-
	   LENT TO A 3-DIMENSIONAL FORTRAN ARRAY, X(1,1,1),
	   X(2,1,1), X(3,1,1), ETC.  THE FIRST SUBSCRIPT IS
	   CASE NUMBER, THE SECOND SUBSCRIPT IS VARIABLE NUMBER
	   AND THE THIRD SUBSCRIPT IS GROUP NUMBER.  THE
	   LENGTH OF VECTOR X IS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
	   DATA POINTS, T*M, WHERE T = N(1)+N(2)+...+N(K).
   XBAR  - OUTPUT MATRIX (M X K) CONTAINING MEANS OF VARIABLES
	   IN K GROUPS.
   D	 - OUTPUT MATRIX (M X M) CONTAINING POOLED DISPERSION.
   CMEAN - WORKING VECTOR OF LENGTH M.

REMARKS
   THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
   THE NUMBER OF GROUPS.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
