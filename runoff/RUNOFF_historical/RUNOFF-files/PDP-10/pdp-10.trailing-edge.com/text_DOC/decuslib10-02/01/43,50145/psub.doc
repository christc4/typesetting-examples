SUBROUTINE PSUB

PURPOSE
   SUBTRACT ONE POLYNOMIAL FROM ANOTHER

USAGE
   CALL PSUB(Z,IDIMZ,X,IDIMX,Y,IDIMY)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Z	 - VECTOR OF RESULTANT COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM
	   SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMZ - DIMENSION OF Z (CALCULATED)
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR FIRST POLYNOMIAL, ORDERED
	   FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X (DEGREE IS IDIMX-1)
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR SECOND POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y (DEGREE IS IDIMY-1)

REMARKS
   VECTOR Z MAY BE IN SAME LOCATION AS EITHER VECTOR X OR
   VECTOR Y ONLY IF THE DIMENSION OF THAT VECTOR IS NOT LESS
   THAN THE OTHER INPUT VECTOR
   THE RESULTANT POLYNOMIAL MAY HAVE TRAILING ZERO COEFFICIENTS

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF RESULTANT VECTOR IDIMZ IS CALCULATED AS THE
   LARGER OF THE TWO INPUT VECTOR DIMENSIONS. COEFFICIENTS IN
   VECTOR Y ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM CORRESPONDING COEFFICIENTS
   IN VECTOR X.
