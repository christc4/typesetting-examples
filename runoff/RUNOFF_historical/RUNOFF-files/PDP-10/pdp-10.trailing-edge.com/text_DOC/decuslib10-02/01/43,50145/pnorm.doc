SUBROUTINE PNORM

PURPOSE
   NORMALIZE COEFFICIENT VECTOR OF A POLYNOMIAL

USAGE
   CALL PNORM(X,IDIMX,EPS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   X	  - VECTOR OF ORIGINAL COEFFICIENTS, ORDERED FROM
	    SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER. IT REMAINS UNCHANGED
   IDIMX  - DIMENSION OF X. IT IS REPLACED BY FINAL DIMENSION
   EPS	  - TOLERANCE BELOW WHICH COEFFICIENT IS ELIMINATED

REMARKS
   IF ALL COEFFICIENTS ARE LESS THAN EPS, RESULT IS A ZERO
   POLYNOMIAL WITH IDIMX=0 BUT VECTOR X REMAINS INTACT

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF VECTOR X IS REDUCED BY ONE FOR EACH TRAILING
   COEFFICIENT WITH AN ABSOLUTE VALUE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO EPS
