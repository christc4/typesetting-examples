SUBROUTINE GTPRD

PURPOSE
   PREMULTIPLY A GENERAL MATRIX BY THE TRANSPOSE OF ANOTHER
   GENERAL MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL GTPRD(A,B,R,N,M,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF FIRST INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF SECOND INPUT MATRIX
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A AND B
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A AND ROWS IN R
   L - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN B AND R

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX B
   ALL MATRICES MUST BE STORED AS GENERAL MATRICES

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   MATRIX TRANSPOSE OF A IS NOT ACTUALLY CALCULATED. INSTEAD,
   ELEMENTS OF MATRIX A ARE TAKEN COLUMNWISE RATHER THAN
   ROWWISE FOR POSTMULTIPLICATION BY MATRIX B.
