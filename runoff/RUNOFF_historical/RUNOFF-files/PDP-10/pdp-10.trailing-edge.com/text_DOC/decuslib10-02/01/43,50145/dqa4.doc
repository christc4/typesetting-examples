SUBROUTINE DQA4

PURPOSE
   TO COMPUTE INTEGRAL(EXP(-X)*FCT(X)/SQRT(X), SUMMED OVER X
		       FROM 0 TO INFINITY).

USAGE
   CALL DQA4 (FCT,Y)
   PARAMETER FCT REQUIRES AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   FCT	  - THE NAME OF AN EXTERNAL DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION
	    SUBPROGRAM USED.
   Y	  - THE RESULTING DOUBLE PRECISION INTEGRAL VALUE.

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   THE EXTERNAL DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM FCT(X)
   MUST BE FURNISHED BY THE USER.

METHOD
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF 4-POINT GENERALIZED GAUSS-
   LAGUERRE QUADRATURE FORMULA, WHICH INTEGRATES EXACTLY
   WHENEVER FCT(X) IS A POLYNOMIAL UP TO DEGREE 7.
