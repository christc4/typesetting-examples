USER-SUPPLIED SPECIAL SUBROUTINE - BOOL

THIS SPECIAL SUBROUTINE ILLUSTRATES AN EXTERNAL SUBROUTINE
CALLED BY SUBROUTINE SUBST.

IF DIFFERENT PROPOSITIONS ARE USED FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN
THE SAME RUN, DIFFERENT SUBROUTINES WITH APPROPRIATE PROPOSI-
TIONS MUST BE COMPILED UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES.  IF SO, THESE
SUBROUTINE NAMES MUST BE DEFINED BY AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT
APPEARING IN THE MAIN PROGRAM WHICH CALLS SUBST.  THEN, FOR
EACH PROBLEM, SUBST IS CALLED WITH A PROPER SUBROUTINE NAME
IN ITS ARGUMENT LIST.
