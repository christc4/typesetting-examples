SUBROUTINE HIST

PURPOSE
   PRINT A HISTOGRAM OF FREQUENCIES VERSUS INTERVALS

USAGE
   CALL HIST(NU,FREQ,IN)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   NU	- HISTOGRAM NUMBER (3 DIGITS MAXIMUM)
   FREQ - VECTOR OF FREQUENCIES
   IN	- NUMBER OF INTERVALS AND LENGTH OF FREQ (MAX IS 20)
	  NORMALLY, FREQ(1) CONTAINS THE FREQUENCY SMALLER THAN
	  THE LOWER BOUND AND FREQ(IN) CONTAINS THE FREQUENCY
	  LARGER THAN THE UPPER BOUND

REMARKS
   FREQUENCIES MUST BE POSITIVE NUMBERS

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE LARGEST FREQUENCY IS DETERMINED AND SCALING IS USED
   IF REQUIRED
