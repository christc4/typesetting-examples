SUBROUTINE AVCAL

PURPOSE
   PERFORM THE CALCULUS OF A FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT USING
   OPERATOR SIGMA AND OPERATOR DELTA.  THIS SUBROUTINE IS
   PRECEDED BY SUBROUTINE ADVAT AND FOLLOWED BY SUBROUTINE
   MEANQ IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR A
   COMPLETE FACTORIAL DESIGN.

USAGE
   CALL AVCAL (K,LEVEL,X,L,ISTEP,LASTS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   K	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES (FACTORS). K MUST BE .GT. ONE.
   LEVEL - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING LEVELS (CATE-
	   GORIES) WITHIN EACH VARIABLE.
   X	 - INPUT VECTOR CONTAINING DATA.  DATA HAVE BEEN PLACED
	   IN VECTOR X BY SUBROUTINE AVDAT.  THE LENGTH OF X
	   IS (LEVEL(1)+1)*(LEVEL(2)+1)*...*(LEVEL(K)+1).
   L	 - THE POSITION IN VECTOR X WHERE THE LAST INPUT DATA
	   IS LOCATED.	L HAS BEEN CALCULATED BY SUBROUTINE
	   AVDAT.
   ISTEP - INPUT VECTOR OF LENGTH K CONTAINING STORAGE CONTROL
	   STEPS WHICH HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY SUBROUTINE
	   AVDAT.
   LASTS - WORKING VECTOR OF LENGTH K.

REMARKS
   THIS SUBROUTINE MUST FOLLOW SUBROUTINE AVDAT.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE TECHNIQUE DISCUSSED BY H. O.
   HARTLEY IN 'MATHEMATICAL METHODS FOR DIGITAL COMPUTERS',
   EDITED BY A. RALSTON AND H. WILF, JOHN WILEY AND SONS,
   1962, CHAPTER 20.
