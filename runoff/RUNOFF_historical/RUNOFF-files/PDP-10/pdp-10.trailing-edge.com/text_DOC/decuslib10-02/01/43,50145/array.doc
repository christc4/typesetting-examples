SUBROUTINE ARRAY

PURPOSE
   CONVERT DATA ARRAY FROM SINGLE TO DOUBLE DIMENSION OR VICE
   VERSA.  THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED TO LINK THE USER PROGRAM
   WHICH HAS DOUBLE DIMENSION ARRAYS AND THE SSP SUBROUTINES
   WHICH OPERATE ON ARRAYS OF DATA IN A VECTOR FASHION.

USAGE
   CALL ARRAY (MODE,I,J,N,M,S,D)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   MODE - CODE INDICATING TYPE OF CONVERSION
	    1 - FROM SINGLE TO DOUBLE DIMENSION
	    2 - FROM DOUBLE TO SINGLE DIMENSION
   I	- NUMBER OF ROWS IN ACTUAL DATA MATRIX
   J	- NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN ACTUAL DATA MATRIX
   N	- NUMBER OF ROWS SPECIFIED FOR THE MATRIX D IN
	  DIMENSION STATEMENT
   M	- NUMBER OF COLUMNS SPECIFIED FOR THE MATRIX D IN
	  DIMENSION STATEMENT
   S	- IF MODE=1, THIS VECTOR IS INPUT WHICH CONTAINS THE
	  ELEMENTS OF A DATA MATRIX OF SIZE I BY J. COLUMN I+1
	  OF DATA MATRIX FOLLOWS COLUMN I, ETC. IF MODE=2,
	  THIS VECTOR IS OUTPUT REPRESENTING A DATA MATRIX OF
	  SIZE I BY J CONTAINING ITS COLUMNS CONSECUTIVELY.
	  THE LENGTH OF S IS IJ, WHERE IJ=I*J.
   D	- IF MODE=1, THIS MATRIX OF SIZE N BY M IS OUTPUT,
	  CONTAINING A DATA MATRIX OF SIZE I BY J IN THE FIRST
	  I ROWS AND J COLUMNS. IF MODE=2, THIS N BY M MATRIX
	  IS INPUT CONTAINING A DATA MATRIX OF SIZE I BY J IN
	  THE FIRST I ROWS AND J COLUMNS.

REMARKS
   VECTOR S CAN BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX D.  VECTOR S
   IS REFERRED AS A MATRIX IN OTHER SSP ROUTINES, SINCE IT
   CONTAINS A DATA MATRIX.
   THIS SUBROUTINE CONVERTS ONLY GENERAL DATA MATRICES (STORAGE
   MODE OF 0).

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBROUTINES REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   REFER TO THE DISCUSSION ON VARIABLE DATA SIZE IN THE SECTION
   DESCRIBING OVERALL RULES FOR USAGE IN THIS MANUAL.
