SUBROUTINE GMPRD

PURPOSE
   MULTIPLY TWO GENERAL MATRICES TO FORM A RESULTANT GENERAL
   MATRIX

USAGE
   CALL GMPRD(A,B,R,N,M,L)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF FIRST INPUT MATRIX
   B - NAME OF SECOND INPUT MATRIX
   R - NAME OF OUTPUT MATRIX
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A AND ROWS IN B
   L - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN B

REMARKS
   ALL MATRICES MUST BE STORED AS GENERAL MATRICES
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX B
   NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF MATRIX A MUST BE EQUAL TO NUMBER OF ROW
   OF MATRIX B

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   THE M BY L MATRIX B IS PREMULTIPLIED BY THE N BY M MATRIX A
   AND THE RESULT IS STORED IN THE N BY L MATRIX R.
