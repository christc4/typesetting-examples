SAMPLE MAIN PROGRAM FOR STEP-WISE MULTIPLE REGRESSION - STEPR

PURPOSE
   (1) READ THE PROBLEM PARAMETER CARD FOR A STEP-WISE MULTIPLE
   REGRESSION, (2) READ SUBSET SELECTION CARDS, (3) CALL THE
   SUBROUTINE TO CALCULATE MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, SIMPLE
   CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS, AND (4) CALL THE SUBROUTINE TO
   PERFORM EACH STEP OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS.

REMARKS
    THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS, N, MUST BE GREATER THAN M+2,
   WHERE M IS THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES.	IF SELECTION CARDS ARE
   NOT PRESENT, THIS PROGRAM CAN NOT PERFORM STEP-WISE MULTIPLE
   REGRESSION.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   CORRE (WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS THE SUBROUTINE DATA)
   MSTR  (WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS THE SUBROUTINE LOC)
   STPRG (WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS THE SUBROUTINE STOUT)

METHOD
   REFER TO C. A. BENNETT AND N. L. FRANKLIN, 'STATISTICAL
   ANALYSIS IN CHEMISTRY AND THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY', JOHN WILEY
