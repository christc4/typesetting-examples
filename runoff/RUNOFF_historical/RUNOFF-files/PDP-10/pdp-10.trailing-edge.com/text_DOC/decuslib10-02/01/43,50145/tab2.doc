SUBROUTINE TAB2

PURPOSE
   PERFORM A TWO-WAY CLASSIFICATION FOR TWO VARIABLES IN AN
   OBSERVATION MATRIX (OR A MATRIX SUBSET) OF THE FREQUENCY,
   PERCENT FREQUENCY, AND OTHER STATISTICS OVER GIVEN CLASS
   INTERVALS.

USAGE
   CALL TAB2(A,S,NOV,UBO,FREQ,PCT,STAT1,STAT2,NO,NV)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A	 - OBSERVATION MATRIX, NO BY NV
   S	 - INPUT VECTOR GIVING SUBSET OF A. ONLY THOSE
	   OBSERVATIONS WITH A CORRESPONDING NON-ZERO S(J) ARE
	   CONSIDERED. VECTOR LENGTH IS NO.
   NOV	 - VARIABLES TO BE CROSS-TABULATED. NOV(1) IS VARIABLE
	       1, NOV(2) IS VARIABLE 2. VECTOR LENGTH IS 2. NOV
	       MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1 AND LESS THAN
	       OR EQUAL TO NV.
   UBO	 - 3 BY 2 MATRIX GIVING LOWER LIMIT, NUMBER OF
	   INTERVALS, AND UPPER LIMIT OF BOTH VARIABLES TO BE
	   TABULATED (FIRST COLUMN FOR VARIABLE 1, SECOND
	   COLUMN FOR VARIABLE 2). IF LOWER LIMIT IS EQUAL TO
	   UPPER LIMIT FOR VARIABLE 1, THE PROGRAM USES THE
	   MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES ON EACH VARIABLE. NUMBER
	   OF INTERVALS MUST INCLUDE TWO CELLS FOR UNDER AND
	   ABOVE LIMITS.
   FREQ  - OUTPUT MATRIX OF FREQUENCIES IN THE TWO-WAY
	   CLASSIFICATION. ORDER OF MATRIX IS INT1 BY INT2,
	   WHERE INT1 IS THE NUMBER OF INTERVALS OF VARIABLE 1
	   AND INT2 IS THE NUMBER OF INTERVALS OF VARIABLE 2.
	   INT1 AND INT2 MUST BE SPECIFIED IN THE SECOND
	   POSITION OF RESPECTIVE COLUMN OF UBO MATRIX.
   PCT	 - OUTPUT MATRIX OF PERCENT FREQUENCIES, SAME ORDER
	   AS FREQ.
   STAT1 - OUTPUT MATRIX SUMMARIZING TOTALS, MEANS, AND
	   STANDARD DEVIATIONS FOR EACH CLASS INTERVAL OF
	   VARIABLE 1. ORDER OF MATRIX IS 3 BY INT1.
   STAT2 - SAME AS STAT1 BUT OVER VARIABLE 2. ORDER OF MATRIX
	   IS 3 BY INT2.
   NO	 - NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS. NO MUST BE GREATER THAN
	   OR EQUAL TO 1.
   NV	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES FOR EACH OBSERVATION. NV
	   MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1.

REMARKS
   IF S IS NULL, OUTPUT AREAS ARE SET TO ZERO

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   INTERVAL SIZES FOR BOTH VARIABLES ARE CALCULATED FROM THE
   GIVEN INFORMATION OR OPTIONALLY FROM THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
   VALUES. THE FREQUENCY AND PERCENT FREQUENCY MATRICES ARE
   DEVELOPED. MATRICES STAT1 AND STAT2 SUMMARIZING TOTALS,
   MEANS, AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS ARE THEN CALCULATED.
   THE DIVISOR FOR STANDARD DEVIATION IS ONE LESS THAN THE
   NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS USED IN EACH CLASS INTERVAL.
