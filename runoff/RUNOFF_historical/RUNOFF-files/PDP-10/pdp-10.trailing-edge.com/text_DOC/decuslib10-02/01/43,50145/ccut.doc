SUBROUTINE CCUT

PURPOSE
   PARTITION A MATRIX BETWEEN SPECIFIED COLUMNS TO FORM TWO
   RESULTANT MATRICES

USAGE
   CALL CCUT (A,L,R,S,N,M,MS)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A - NAME OF INPUT MATRIX
   L - COLUMN OF A TO THE LEFT OF WHICH PARTITIONING TAKES
       PLACE
   R - NAME OF MATRIX TO BE FORMED FROM LEFT PORTION OF A
   S - NAME OF MATRIX TO BE FORMED FROM RIGHT PORTION OF A
   N - NUMBER OF ROWS IN A
   M - NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN A
   MS  - ONE DIGIT NUMBER FOR STORAGE MODE OF MATRIX A
	  0 - GENERAL
	  1 - SYMMETRIC
	  2 - DIAGONAL

REMARKS
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX S CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX A
   MATRIX R CANNOT BE IN SAME LOCATION AS MATRIX S
   MATRIX R AND MATRIX S ARE ALWAYS GENERAL MATRICES

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   LOC

METHOD
   ELEMENTS OF MATRIX A TO THE LEFT OF COLUMN L ARE MOVED TO
   FORM MATRIX R OF N ROWS AND L-1 COLUMNS. ELEMENTS OF
   MATRIX A IN COLUMN L AND TO THE RIGHT OF L ARE MOVED TO FORM
   MATRIX S OF N ROWS AND M-L+1 COLUMNS.
