SUBROUTINE DCNPS

PURPOSE
   COMPUTES THE VALUE OF AN N-TERM EXPANSION IN CHEBYSHEV
   POLYNOMIALS WITH COEFFICIENT VECTOR C FOR ARGUMENT VALUE X.

USAGE
   CALL DCNPS(Y,X,C,N)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Y	 - RESULT VALUE
	   DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLE
   X	 - ARGUMENT VALUE
	   DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLE
   C	 - COEFFICIENT VECTOR OF GIVEN EXPANSION
	   COEFFICIENTS ARE ORDERED FROM LOW TO HIGH
	   DOUBLE PRECISION VECTOR
   N	 - DIMENSION OF COEFFICIENT VECTOR C

REMARKS
   OPERATION IS BYPASSED IN CASE N LESS THAN 1

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DEFINITION
   Y=SUM(C(I)*T(I-1,X), SUMMED OVER I FROM 1 TO N).
   EVALUATION IS DONE BY MEANS OF BACKWARD RECURSION
   USING THE RECURRENCE EQUATION FOR CHEBYSHEV POLYNOMIALS
   T(N+1,X)=2*X*T(N,X)-T(N-1,X).
