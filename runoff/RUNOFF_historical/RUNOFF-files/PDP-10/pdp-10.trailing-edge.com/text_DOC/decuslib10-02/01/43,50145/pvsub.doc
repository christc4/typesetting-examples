SUBROUTINE PVSUB

PURPOSE
   SUBSTITUTE VARIABLE OF A POLYNOMIAL BY ANOTHER POLYNOMIAL

USAGE
   CALL PVSUB(Z,IDIMZ,X,IDIMX,Y,IDIMY,WORK1,WORK2)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Z	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR RESULTANT POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMZ - DIMENSION OF Z
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR ORIGINAL POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR POLYNOMIAL WHICH IS
	   SUBSTITUTED FOR VARIABLE, ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO
	   LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y
   WORK1 - WORKING STORAGE ARRAY (SAME DIMENSION AS Z)

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   PMPY
   PADDM
   PCLA

METHOD
   VARIABLE OF POLYNOMIAL X IS SUBSTITUTED BY POLYNOMIAL Y
   TO FORM POLYNOMIAL Z. DIMENSION OF NEW POLYNOMIAL IS
   (IDIMX-1)*(IDIMY-1)+1. SUBROUTINE REQUIRES TWO WORK AREAS
