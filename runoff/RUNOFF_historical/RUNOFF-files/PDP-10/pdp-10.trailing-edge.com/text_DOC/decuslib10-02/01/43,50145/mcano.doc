SAMPLE MAIN PROGRAM FOR CANONICAL CORRELATION - MCANO

PURPOSE
   (1) READ THE PROBLEM PARAMETER CARD FOR A CANONICAL
   CORRELATION, (2) CALL TWO SUBROUTINES TO CALCULATE SIMPLE
   CORRELATIONS, CANONICAL CORRELATIONS, CHI-SQUARES, DEGREES
   OF FREEDOM FOR CHI-SQUARES, AND COEFFICIENTS FOR LEFT AND
   RIGHT HAND VARIABLES, NAMELY CANONICAL VARIATES, AND (3)
   PRINT THE RESULTS.

REMARKS
   THE NUMBER OF LEFT HAND VARIABLES MUST BE GREATER THAN
   OR EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF RIGHT HAND VARIABLES.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   CORRE  (WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS THE INPUT SUBROUTINE NAMED
	  DATA.)
   CANOR  (WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS THE SUBROUTINES MINV AND
	  NROOT.  NROOT, IN TURN, CALLS THE SUBROUTINE EIGEN.)

METHOD
   REFER TO W. W. COOLEY AND P. R. LOHNES, 'MULTIVARIATE PRO-
