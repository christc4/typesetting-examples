SUBROUTINE PINT

PURPOSE
   FIND INTEGRAL OF A POLYNOMIAL WITH CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION
   EQUAL TO ZERO

USAGE
   CALL PINT(Y,IDIMY,X,IDIMX)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR INTEGRAL, ORDERED FROM
	   SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y (EQUAL TO IDIMX+1)
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR ORIGINAL POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   DIMENSION OF Y IS SET AT DIMENSION OF X PLUS ONE, AND THE
   CONSTANT TERM IS SET TO ZERO. INTEGRAL IS THEN CALCULATED
   BY DIVIDING COEFFICIENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPONENTS.
