           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-20  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-20  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 1.2 of ALGOL-20

            Version 2 of APLSF-20

            Version 2.1 of BASIC-PLUS-2

            Version 12C of COBOL

            Version 6.1 of DBMS-20

            Version 11 of FORTRAN-20

            Version 1 of FTS-20

            Version 4.2 of GALAXY-20

            Version 1 of PASCAL-20

            Version 4D of SORT-20

            Version 4.1 of TOPS-20 and utilities

                                                                  Page 2


            Version 4 of TRAFFIC-20

     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.
                                                                  Page 3


     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     2.1  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION SAVE-SET

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  DUMPER  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in PS:<SUBSYS>  or  one  of
     the directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed in PS:<HELP> or one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following file should be installed in the  disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP201.PDF

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also  contains  batch  control  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These "Distribution DUMPER Control" files are intended to run under
     batch.   They  issue  a  MOUNT request for the product distribution
     tape and then run DUMPER to restore the required  files.   Some  of
     these  .DDC  files do MORE then just restore files.  They should be
     used instead of manually running DUMPER.  See the last section  for
     a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-20-V2  product  you
     would install

                APL2S2.CTL      for APLSF-20 rebuild
                APL2S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL2S2.DDC      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.
                                                                  Page 4


     2.2  PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PATCHING DIRECTORIES

     A new procedure has been implemented to permit additional  patching
     directories  to  be  specified on a product basis.  Because of disk
     directory limitations this procedure is MANDATORY.

     PEP has been modified to ask  for  a  definition  of  the  patching
     directory  (PAT:)  whenever  a  product  is  initially selected for
     Autopatching.   In  order  to  use  the  new  feature,  three   (3)
     directories  must  be specified.  The first directory named is used
     for temporary files and must be created before submitting the patch
     &  build  BATCH  control  file.   The second directory named is the
     location of  files  delivered  on  the  Autopatch  tape  which  are
     specific  to  a  product.   The third directory named is the common
     Autopatch patching directory.  The patch and  build  control  files
     delivered  with  Autopatch  will  then  use the first directory for
     temporary files.  EXAMPLE:

     What is the patching directory for COBOL-20-V12C?
     	AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBLWRK>,AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBLPAT>,AP20:<AUTOPATCH>

     All of the .Ann and .Pnn control files which restore items from the
     Autopatch  tape  use  this  multiple patching directory convention.
     Any attempt to load the entire patch tape into  a  common  patching
     directory  will  fail.   Two control files have been provided which
     will restore all products from the patch tape  -  ALL.Ann  for  the
     entire  tape  and ALL.Pnn for the current patch set.  These control
     files have the following directories specified:

     ALGOL-20-V1-2              AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGPAT>
     APLSF-20-V2                AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APLPAT>
     BASIC-2-20-V2A             AP20:<AUTOPATCH.B20PAT>
     COBOL-20-V12C              AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBLPAT>
     DBMS-20-V6-1               AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMPAT>
     FORTRAN-20-V11             AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>
     FTS-20-V1                  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTSPAT>
     GALAXY-20-V4-2             AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>
     PASCAL-20-V1               AP20:<AUTOPATCH.PASPAT>
     SORT-20-V4D                AP20:<AUTOPATCH.SRTPAT>
     TOPS-20-2020-V4-1          AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>
     TRAFFIC-20-V4              AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TFRPAT>
     UTILITIES-V4-1             AP20:<AUTOPATCH.UTLPAT>

     These directories must be created before using the control files on
     the    Autopatch    tape.    Users   who   have   already   created
     product-specific  patching  directories  as  directed  on  previous
     Autopatch tapes should edit these names to agree with what has been
     set  up  before  using  these  control  files.   If  you  are   not
     Autopatching a specific product do not create a patch directory for
     that product.  The ALL.Ann and ALL.Pnn control files  can  then  be
     used for Autopatch tape processing for all users.  The process will
     not load files for  which  directories  are  not  available.   Each
     control  file  BUILDs  a  temporary  directory  for loading.  To be
     successful, the process must be able to run  enabled  and  must  be
     submitted with at least a 30 minute time allowance.
                                                                  Page 5


     The limited directory trait also means that all  products  can  not
     have  BAK:   defined  as  a common directory.  It is suggested that
     each product have it's own BAK:  directory.
                                                                  Page 6


     2.3  SUGGESTED INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

     The suggested procedure for initial Autopatch installation is:

     1.  BUILD  the  common  patching   directory   <AUTOPATCH>.    This
         directory must have WHEEL privileges.

     2.  With DUMPER, RESTORE the README.* file and the ALL.A* file from
         the  first  save-set  and  the  INSTAL.DOC file from the second
         save-set.

     3.  Read  the  documentation  files  and  BUILD   the   appropriate
         distribution, backup, and patching directories.

     4.  SUBMIT the ALL.Ann file (nn is current Autopatch tape number).

     5.  SUBMIT the  appropriate  .DDC  files  to  process  distribution
         tapes.

     6.  With PEP, SELECT the appropriate products.

                                                                  Page 7


     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-20-V1-2  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the current save set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use on  of
     the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-20
     distribution  tape BB-5471C-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the ALGOL-20 distribution directory.
        
        From save set "SOURCE files for ALGOL"
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the ALGOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
                                                                  Page 8


     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.ALGOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.ALGPAT>ALGV12.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build process for ALGOL redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.
                                                                  Page 9


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Before preparing  this  product  for  autopatching,  it  should  be
     installed   on   your  system  as  described  in  the  installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tape.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  APLSF-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                APLSF.EXE
                GENSF.EXE
                APLTAP.EXE

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  APLSF-20
     distribution  tape BB-5137E-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the APLSF-20 distribution directory.
        
           From save set "REL LIBRARY FOR TOPS-20 APLSF VERSION 2"
        
                APLS22.REL
                APLG22.REL
                APLW22.REL
                APLS22.LNK
                APLG22.LNK
                APLW22.LNK

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the APLSF-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APL>.  If you wish  to
     use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in  the  BATCH.CMD
     file  on  the  PS:   structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control  file  if  you  choose  not  to  use <AUTOPATCH.APL> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.APLPAT>APL2S2.DDC


     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
                                                                 Page 10


     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 11


     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING BASIC-PLUS-2

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  BASIC-PLUS-2  is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                BASIC.EXE
                BASOTS.EXE

     You will need to copy the following  files  from  the  BASIC-PLUS-2
     distribution  tape BB-5543F-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the BASIC-PLUS-2 distribution directory.
        
        From save set "Autopatch files for BASIC PLUS 2 version 2.1(320)"
        
                B20CMA.LNK
                B20CMA.REL
                B20OTA.LNK
                B20OTA.REL

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the BASIC-PLUS-2  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.BASIC>.  If  you
     wish  to  use  this  control  file,  but  are  not  using  an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.BASIC>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.B20PAT>B20V2A.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 12


     3.4  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING COBOL-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  COBOL-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                C74O12.EXE
                C74LIB.REL
                CBL74.EXE
                COBDDT.REL
                CPYLIB.EXE
                ISAM.EXE
                LIBARY.EXE
                RERUN.EXE
                68274.EXE       for 68-to-74 translation tool

     The COBOL V12C product may be patched via source file updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files

     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  COBOL  product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in INS:.

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.  You will
     need to copy the following files  from  the  COBOL-20  distribution
     tape  BB-H506E-BM  into  the  disk directory you have set up as the
     COBOL-20 distribution directory.

        COBASM.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the COBOL-20 distribution tape and then restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.COBOL>.  If  you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this  control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.COBOL>
     as the distribution directory.  This control file also restores the
     files for Autopatching the SORT-20-V4D product.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBLPAT>CBL12C.DDC
                for source patching

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.CBLPAT>CBR12C.DDC
                for EXE/REL replacement patching

     If you will be source Autopatching the 68274 Translation Tool,  new
     files   are   required  in  the  patching  directory.   Obtain  the
     COBASM.MAC file and make a copy named C74ASM.MAC.   You  must  then
     create  a  copy  of the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set
     on, the ANS68 switch on, and the  ANS74  switch  off  and  call  it
     TRNASM.MAC.   For  more  information  refer  to  section 6.0 of the
     COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12C distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     If you do not have a DBMS distribution tape then the  DBMS  support
     files  for  the  COBOL  Compiler  are  obtained from the COBOL V12C
     distribution tape.

     If you have a DBMS distribution tape then the  DBMS  support  files
     for  the  COBOL  compiler  are  obtained from the DBMS distribution
     tape.  The use of the DB2V61-CBL.DDC file from the second save  set
     will restore the required files to the AP20:<AUTOPATCH.COBOL> area.

     First-time users of COBOL-V12C that do not have DBMS-V6.1 will  see
     checksum  warnings  at  SELECT  time and during the first Autopatch
     session.  These messages may be ignored.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for  more  information.   The  Autopatch  build  process  for COBOL

     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-20 V6.1

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-20  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                DBMS.REL
                SCHEMA.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                FORDML.EXE
                XDML.EXE



     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL        WILD.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  DBMS-20  V6.1
     distribution  tape BB-4148F-BM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the DBMS-20 distribution directory.

                FUNAD.FIX       XDBIND.FIX

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DBMS-20 V6.1  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.

     If you wish to use this control file, but are not  using  an  AP20:
     structure,  you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> as
     the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMPAT>DB2V61.DDC
        

     Revised copies of DBCS24.CMD, DBCS28.CMD  and  DBCS2F.CMD  for  the
     DBMS-V6  product  have  been delivered on previous Autopatch tapes.
     Be sure that these copies are NOT in the common patching  directory
     (PAT:).

     If you will be using DBMS-20 with COBOL-20 you will  need  to  copy
     the  following files from the DBMS-20 distribution tape BB-4148E-BM
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   COBOL-20
     distribution directory.

                COPYRT.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the DBMS-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMS>.   In  the  DDC
     file  which  also prepares the COBOL-20 directory CDIS:  is defined
     to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.COBOL>.  If you  wish  to  use  this  control
     file,  but  are  not  using  an  AP20:  structure, you will want to
     include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in the BATCH.CMD  file  on  the
     PS:   structure  for  the  LOGIN account from which you will SUBMIT
     this control file.  However, you will have  to  edit  this  control
                                                                 Page 18


     file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.DBMS> or <AUTOPATCH.COBOL>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.DBMPAT>DB2V61-CBL.DDC
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build  process for DBMS redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.

     Unlike the V6 product, the V6.1 Autopatch procedure  requires  that
     COBOL  and/or FORTRAN be built BEFORE the DBMS V6.1 Autopatch build
     is submitted.  The DBMS V6.1  Autopatch  procedure  will  implement
     DBMS within COBOL and FORTRAN.
                                                                 Page 19


     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-20   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                FORTRA.EXE
                FORO11.EXE
                FORLIB.REL
                FORDDT.REL


     The FORTRAN V11 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption the KEY files must be retrieved  from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-20 V11 distribution  tape  BB-4157I-SM  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-20 distribution
     directory.

        From the seventh save set

                FORTRA.KEY
                FORLIB.KEY
                FORO11.KEY
                FORDDT.KEY

     If you  are  also  using  DBMS  with  FORTRAN  you  will  need  the
     FORDBM.REL file from the first save set of the Autopatch tape.

     If  you  desire  to  Autopatch  FORTRAN  via  updated  sources  the
     following files are required.  They must be available either in the
     patching area (PAT:), the distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the first save set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV
        MONSYM.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  FORTRAN-20
     distribution  tape BB-4157I-SM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the FORTRAN-20 distribution directory.

        BLIS10.ERR      BLIS10.EXE      BLIS10.HLP

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for  the  FORTRAN-20  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to  be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>.   If
     you  wish  to  use  this  control  file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.FORTRAN>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>FTN211.DDC
                        for source file updating

           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTNPAT>FTN2X1.DDC
                        for EXE/REL replacement updating
        

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a DUMPER control  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for  more  information.   The  Autopatch  build process for FORTRAN
     redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY that a structure be specified when
     providing the directory specifications during the initial SELECTion
     process.
                                                                 Page 22


     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FTS-20

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  FTS-20  is  referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                FTS.EXE
                FTSLIB.REL

     You will need to copy the following files from the FTS distribution
     tape  BB-M251A-BM  into  the  disk directory you have set up as the
     FTS-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the second save set
        
                FTSLIB.REL

        From the third save set

                FTS20.REL

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the FTS-20 distribution tape and  then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTS>.  If you wish  to
     use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in  the  BATCH.CMD
     file  on  the  PS:   structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control  file  if  you  choose  not  to  use <AUTOPATCH.FTS> as the
     distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.FTSPAT>FTS201.DDC

     Since there is some file/module set-up processing and some  of  the
     files  must  be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file
     to set up the directory.

     The FTS product  build  also  requires  some  files  from  the  DIL
     distribution.   The  required  files have been put on the Autopatch
     tape.  The following files are restored to PAT:  and should be  put
     into the FTS distribution directory.
                B362LB.REL
                DAP2V1.REL
                XPN2V1.REL
                                                                 Page 23


                XPORT.REL

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 24


     3.8  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING GALAXY-20

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for GALAXY-20 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                BATCON.EXE      ORION.EXE
                CDRIVE.EXE      PLEASE.EXE
                GLXLIB.EXE      QMANGR.EXE
                GLXLIB.REL      QUASAR.EXE
                LPTSPL.EXE      SPRINT.EXE
                MOUNTR.EXE      SPROUT.EXE
                OPR.EXE

     The following files are required to build the GALAXY product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the current save set of the Autopatch tape

        ACTSYM.UNV      MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You  will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  a   TOPS-20
     distribution  set  into  the  disk directory you have set up as the
     GALAXY-20 distribution directory.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
                                                                 Page 25


     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the TOPS-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>.  If you  wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit  this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.GALAXY>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>GALV42.DDC
        

     If you use any of the TOPS-20 Monitor/EXEC DDC files, the  required
     files  for  this  product will be loaded into a common distribution
     directory which must be specified when selecting this  product  for
     autopatching.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in

     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.  The
     Autopatch  build  process for SORT redefines DSK:.  It is MANDATORY
     that  a  structure  be  specified  when  providing  the   directory
     specifications during the initial SELECTion process.

     3.11  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TOPS-20

     The monitor and EXEC for all supported hardware configurations  are
     autopatchable  with  Autopatch-10/20.  Before preparing TOPS-20 for
     autopatching, the monitor and EXEC  should  be  installed  on  your
     system  as described in the installation documentation for TOPS-20.
     The  directory  PS:<SYSTEM>  in  which  you  have   installed   the
     executable  files  for  the  monitor and EXEC is referred to as the
     installation directory.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                MONITR.EXE
                EXEC.EXE
                BUGSTRINGS.TXT

     The following files are required to build the TOPS20 product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the current save set of the Autopatch tape

        MACREL.REL      MACSYM.UNV      MONSYM.REL      MONSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  on
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the TOPS-20 product  distribution
     directory.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  TOPS-20  2020
     distribution  tape  BB-D868E-BM/BB-V895A-BM into the disk directory
     you have set up as the TOPS-20-2020-V4-1 distribution directory.
        
        From save set "Subsys files for TOPS-20 V4.1"   

        LDINIT.REL      PHYPAR.UNV      PROKS.UNV       PROLOG.UNV
        SERCOD.UNV

       From save set "Sources for TOPS-20 V4.1"

        EXECC0.REL      KSPRE.MAC       PARAMS.MAC      STG.MAC
        T2020.REL       T20EXA.REL      VERSIO.MAC


     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a  mount  request  for  the  TOPS-20  tape  and  then  restore  the
     appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this control file,
     DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If  you  wish  to
     use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure, you
     will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command in  the  BATCH.CMD
     file  on  the  PS:   structure for the LOGIN account from which you
     will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to edit this
     control  file  if  you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20> as the
                                                                 Page 31


     distribution directory.  After creating  the  product  distribution
     directory, submit the required control file as a batch job.
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>T22V41-SML.DDC for SMALL monitor
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>T22V41-MED.DDC for MEDIUM monitor

     Since there are a number of files involved and some  of  the  files
     must  be renamed, we recommend that you use the control file to set
     up the directory.  The difference between these files is that  each
     will  pick  up  the  correct configuration-specific parameter files
     from the distribution tape and rename them  to  be  NAMAM0.MAC  and
     PARAM0.MAC.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 32


     3.12  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING TRAFFIC-20-V4

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   TRAFFIC-20   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                TFR.EXE         TFRCAL.UNV
                TFRCOB.REL      TFRUNV.UNV
                IP20.REL        DUMVET.REL

     The following files are required to build the LINK  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

       From the current save set of the Autopatch tape

        MACSYM.UNV      MACTEN.UNV      MONSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the DUMPER control files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files from  the  TRAFFIC-20  V4
     distribution  tape BB-5372E-SM into the disk directory you have set
     up as the TRAFFIC-20 distribution directory.
        
        From the third save set
        
        CLEAR.MAC       TFRCAL.MAC
        DUMVET.MAC      TFRCOB.MAC
        IP20.MAC        TFRUNV.MAC
        TFR.MAC

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for  the  TRAFFIC-20  distribution  tape  and  then
     restore  the  appropriate  files to the logical name DIS:.  In this
     batch file, DIS:  is defined to  be  AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TRAFFIC>.   If
     you  wish  to  use  this  control  file, but are not using an AP20:
     structure, you will want to include a 'DEF AP20:  str:' command  in
     the BATCH.CMD file on the PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to
     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TRAFFIC>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TFRPAT>TFR2V4.DDC
                                                                 Page 33


        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.13  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING UTILITIES-20

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  UTILITIES-20  is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most cases this will be PS:<SUBSYS> or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:

        The files marked with (*) are maintained in INS: by Autopatch
        but must also reside in <SYSTEM> for proper system operation.

        DIL, DUMPER, EDT, LINK, MACRO, RMS and SPEAR were delivered on
        the TOPS-20 Update tape.


     The following files are required to build  the  UTILITIES  product.
     They  must  be  available  either  in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in INS:.

     A batch control file to perform this operation has been included in
     the installation save set on this patch tape.  This file will issue
     a mount request for the TOPS-20 distribution tape and then  restore
     the  appropriate  files  to  the  logical name DIS:.  In this batch
     file, DIS:  is defined to be AP20:<AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>.  If you wish
     to  use  this  control file, but are not using an AP20:  structure,
     you will want to  include  a  'DEF  AP20:   str:'  command  in  the
     BATCH.CMD  file  on  the  PS:  structure for the LOGIN account from
     which you will SUBMIT this control file.  However, you will have to

     edit this control file if you choose not to use <AUTOPATCH.TOPS-20>
     as the distribution directory.
        
        To execute this control file, issue the following command:
        
           @SUBMIT AP20:<AUTOPATCH.T20PAT>UTLV41.DDC
        

     If you use any of the TOPS-20 Monitor/EXEC DDC files, the  required
     files  for  this  product will be loaded into a common distribution
     directory which must be specified when selecting this  product  for
     autopatching.  You will still need to use the UPD5.DDC file to load
     files from the Update tape.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     DUMPER control file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
