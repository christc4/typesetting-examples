2.0                 EXTERNAL CHANGES AND OPTIONS


2.1                 DEVELOPMENT ENHANCEMENTS to COBOL


    2.1.1 FIPS Flagger

         FIPS PUB 21-1 states that the COBOL-74 compiler must  contain
         a  capability to flag all syntax above the level supported by
         the compiler.  The FCTC people interpret that to mean that  a
         high  level  compiler must be able to flag at any of the four
         levels.  Version 12B has extended that idea to flag a variety
         of different syntax sets.
         The level flags are:
         0 = no information
         1 = FIPS LOW level
         2 = FIPS LOW-INTERMEDIATE level
         3 = FIPS HIGH-INTERMEDIATE level
         4 = FIPS HIGH level
         R = Report Writer
         D = Data Base
         6 = COBOL-68 leftover
         I = IBM compatibility
         V = VAX COBOL-74 compatible
         8 = COBOL-8X (next standard) extension
         N = non-standard extension

         The flagger is implemented for COBOL-74  only.   It  modifies
         the  /Y  switch  to  take  a character string i.e.  /Y:abcde.
         Only one of the  set  1,  2,  3,  4  is  allowed,  all  other
         combinations  are  legal.   This  set  is  checked  and every
         syntactic and semantic construct which is outside  the  union
         of  this  set  is  flagged.   The  switch  /Y:-abcde  is also
         allowed.  This flags all syntax and semantics  which  are  in
         the union of the set.

         The warning message is of the form:
         <level> syntax exceeds requested compatibility level.
         Where <level> indicated the offending syntax's level

    2.1.2 DEBUG MODULE

         The features of the COBOL-74 language that support the  Debug
         module are:
         A compile time switch - WITH DEBUGGING MODE.
         An object time switch.
         A USE FOR DEBUGGING statement.
         A special register - DEBUG-ITEM.
         Debugging lines.

         The Debug module uses COBDDT  to  search  the  user's  symbol
         table and to load the DEBUG-ITEM.

EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


    2.1.3 COMPUTE STATEMENT

         Internal support for double precision floating point has been
         added  to both the compiler and OTS.  This new feature causes
         all  COMPUTE  statements  to  coerce  the  data  into  double
         precision  floating  point.  There are no plans to add double
         precision floating point as an external data type.

         The  temporary  feature  test  switch  BISCMP  introduced  in
         version  12A has been removed and the code that was under the
         ON condition has been left in.  In version  12A  this  switch
         was  OFF.   There  is no change in functionality, however the
         long standing COMPUTE problems will be fixed.   However  this
         does  introduce  another  problem  in  that  it is not always
         possible to represent a fraction exactly as a floating  point
         number.  This causes a problem when, for example, the correct
         result  is  123.4500  but   it   has   been   calculated   as
         123.449999999,  if  the  output  PICTURE is S9(3)v99 then the
         result will be 123.44 not 123.45.   If  the  result  has  the
         ROUNDED  option all will be well.  In the case of no rounding
         the compiler will add (or subtract) a correcting  term  which
         is  1/500  of  the  equivalent  rounding  term.  In the above
         example the number would be rounded by adding 0.005, then the
         non-rounding correction would be 0.00001.

    2.1.4 RERUN on ISAM files

         This change is really being done for the FCTC COBOL tests, it
         is  expected  no customer will actually use this feature.  In
         version 12B it will  now  be  possible  to  restart  a  COBOL
         program  at  a RERUN checkpoint with ISAM files open and have
         the right thing  happen.   Previously  this  was  disallowed.
         However  it  is  still not possible to use RERUN with SORT or
         Simultaneous Update files open.

    2.1.5 OPEN EXTEND

         This feature was not previously inplemented  on  TOPS-20  (it
         worked  on  TOPS-10  but  had  some  defficiencies).   PA1050
         version 4.1 has been modified to  suport  the  FILOP  APPEND.
         Note  this is a change to PA1050 as well as COBOL.  The minor
         TOPS-10 deficiencies has also been fixed.

    2.1.6 MULTI-KEY ISAM

         This is implemented on  TOPS-20  by  calling  RMS-20  and  on
         TOPS-10  by calling RMS-10.  The ORGANIZATION clause has been
         changed to include RMS as a reserved word,  as,  ORGANIZATION
         IS RMS INDEXED.  Also if the ALTERNATE KEY clause is seen the
         file will default to RMS.  A special  standalone  version  of
         RMS-20 called RMSCOB will be loaded by LIBOL if RMS files are
         required.  This version of RMS will be loaded  at  525000  in
         the user's address space.

EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


    2.1.7 STRING/UNSTRING

         The STRING/UNSTRING package has been  rewritten  for  version
         12B.   This  was  done  to implement variable-length strings,
         necessary to pass the FCTC COBOL tests for validation.   This
         change   makes  necessary  the  recompilation  of  all  COBOL
         programs that wish to use the new code, however the old  code
         is  also  available so as to be fully compatible with version
         12A.

    2.1.8 Transportable ASCII files

         This  is  reading  and  writing   ASCII   records   with   no
         carriage-return  line-feed.   This  is  done in the following
         ways:
         If the file has a RECORDING  MODE  IS  STANDARD-ASCII  clause
         then all data will be read and written with no <CR-LF>s.
         On TOPS-20 if the user has set the tape mode to  be  STANDARD
         ASCII  and  the tape has system labels and the recording mode
         is default SIXBIT, then the file will read and  written  with
         no <CR-LF>s (see COBOL Reference Manual mag-tape appendix).

    2.1.9 READ REVERSED

         This is only supported for magtapes who's controllers support
         this feature.
         This is NOT supported with System labels (either  TOPS-10  or
         TOPS-20).
         Tapes must be BLOCKED 1, unblocked tapes are NOT supported.
         On TOPS-20 READ REVERSED is not supported for ANSI-ASCII.

    2.1.10 COBDDT

         On TOPS-20 COBDDT has been modified to make it  native.   The
         command  syntax  is  compatible with COBDDT 12A.  However, if
         you wish to use  the  new  COBDDT  you  must  recompile  your
         programs with COBOL 12B.
         A "SHOW SYMBOLS" command has  been  implemented,  which  will
         print out all symbols that match an input mask.  The mask can
         contain the wildcard characters "*"  (matches  zero  or  more
         characters) and "%" (matches any one character).
         The DDT command will now try to read in DDT from  the  system
         if it is not already in core.
         Datanames that were defined in the FILE section  may  now  be
         qualified  by  the  filename.  This feature required compiler
         changes and therefore it  only  works  if  your  program  was
         compiled using COBOL 12B.

    2.1.11 ISAM Utility

         The ISAM utility contains the following improvements:
         A switch /R to RENAME an ISAM file, this will also change the
         name of the IDA file which is embedded in the IDX file.
         A switch /C which will check an ISAM  file  for  consistency.
COBOL-74 V12B Documentation                                     Page 7
EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


         It is similar to /P except no output file is written.
         A switch /S has been added to output  more  statistics  about
         the disk usage of an isam file.
         In addition to the /S switch, suggested blocking factors will
         be  presented  in  the  build/maintain  dialogue,  as well as
         statistics after building an ISAM file indicating the  effect
         of the blocking factors on the free space in the file.

    2.1.12 COBOL-68 syntax removed from COBOL-74

         The following obsolete COBOL-68 syntax has been removed  from
         COBOL-74:
         GOBACK.  EXIT PROGRAM is equivalent.

    2.1.13 CHECKPOINT OUTPUT

         The original version 12 syntax was:
         ACCESS MODE IS INDEXED CHECKPOINT OUTPUT
         The action is to do a CHECKPOINT FILOP after  every  physical
         output  which is equivalent to, but much faster than, a CLOSE
         followed by  an  OPEN.   This  should  greatly  increase  the
         reliability of ISAM files at the expense of performance.

         At user's requests the syntax was expanded in version 12A  to
         cover RANDOM and SEQUENTIAL also.

         In version 12B it has been further enhanced to be:
         CHECKPOINT OUTPUT EVERY integer RECORDS.
         where EVERY and RECORDS are optional and integer is a  number
         between 0 and 255.
         If EVERY integer RECORDS is not given  or  integer  is  zero,
         then   the   action  is  as  in  version  12A,  the  file  is
         checkpointed (via FILOP) after every physical output.
         If integer is non-zero then the file  is  checkpointed  after
         integer  WRITES  regardless  of how many physical writes have
         been done.

    2.1.14 Software Switches
         To pass the FCTC COBOL-74 tests software switches had  to  be
         implemented.   On  TOPS-20  this is done via the logical name
         SWITCHES.  This is similar to the way  the  debug  switch  is
         implemented.   The  contents  of the logical name is 12 ASCII
         characters representing the 36 bits in  octal.   For  example
         SWITCH (0) and SWITCH (34) being on would be 400000000002.

    2.1.15 DATE-COMPILED
         To pass the FCTC COBOL-74 tests the  DATE-COMPILED  paragraph
         has  been  changed  to conform to what the FCTC wanted.  This
         is, all lines in  the  DATE-COMPILED  paragraph  are  deleted
         except  for  comment  lines.  The current date is substituted
         for the first line.  This is different  from  COBOL-68  where
         only the first line is deleted.

    2.1.16 ASCII and EBCDIC Collating Sequence

EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


         All known bugs with COBOL-74  collating  sequence  code  have
         been fixed.

    2.1.17 REPORT WRITER

         The following COBOL-74 enhancements have been made:
         SOURCE IS data-item can now be subscripted.
         SUPPRESS verb is implemented.

    2.1.18 MAG-TAPE HANDLING and SYSTEM-LABELED TAPES

         The 12A release of COBOL supported system labeled tapes at  a
         basic  level.  12B will support these tapes at a much greater
         level of detail, so that specific types of compatible labeled
         tapes  may  now  be  created and read.  This is true for both
         TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.  See the new appendix  (appendix  F)  to
         the  COBOL manuals for a detailed discussion of COBOL and mag
         tapes.

3.0                 DEFICIENCIES


3.1                 Deficiencies from COBOL v12 and v12A


     COPY REPLACING has some problems in that it is  not  possible  to
     replace either part of PIC xyz without replacing the whole.
     i.e.  REPLACING ==PIC S9(10)==
     will work
     but
     REPLACING ==PIC== or REPLACING ==S9(10)== will not.

     Note, it was never  the  intent  (and  it  contravenes  the  ANSI
     standard) for COPY REPLACING to replace part of a data-item.
     REPLACING AA by BB should not turn AA-XYZ into BB-XYZ.

     There is currently an incompatibility between TOPS-10 and TOPS-20
     that  causes  a  problem  for  simultaneous update under TOPS-20.
     Under TOPS-10 it is possible to have one program open a file  for
     INPUT  (only)  without  simultaneous  update control while at the
     same time another program is running that opens the same file for
     simultaneous update.  Currently TOPS-20 does not support the open
     mode that allows this, so that the first program to open the file
     will  stop  the  other, with its different mode, from running (it
     will die with an open error).  This incompatibility will  not  be
     addressed by TOPS-20 until a future release.

     We do not recommend that this change  be  installed  unless  your
     installation  is  having  problems  transfering  data  TO  an IBM
     machine.

     The ASCII to EBCDIC translation table was changed in  version  12
     (as  the  result  of  several  SPRs)  so  that the translation of
     graphics was more correct.   However  it  is  still  not  correct
     according  to  IBM  documentation, we are currently investigating
     what VAX does to see if there can be a DEC to IBM standard we can
     live  with.   However it seems that we now in some cases generate
     incorrect EBCDIC characters for minus zero.  The interim solution
     for  those  who  see this problem is to put the translation table
     back the  way  it  was  in  version  11  knowing  then  that  the
     translation of some graphics will be wrong.

3.2                 Deficiencies from before COBOL v12


     Program ID same as filename, procedure name or data name  results
     in spurious error messages.

     If A=B and C=D or E for subscripted A and  C  gives  wrong  code,
     cause "SUBSCRIPT not POSITIVE" run time message if subscripts not
     COMP or INDEX.

     Error not detected.
     A RESET FINAL clause is legitimate only when FINAL is given as  a
     control.   Violation  of  this  rule  goes  undiagnosed.  A RESET
     clause  can  only  accompany  a  sum  clause.   A  RESET   clause
     accompanying a source clause receives no diagnostic.

     Incorrect error message.
     DATA-NAME RC which is defined on last line of the working-storage
     section is incorrectly diagnosed as undefined in the declaratives
     area of procedure division.  It is considered to be defined ok in
     the report section, however.

     Incorrect error message.
     COBOL rules make the presence of  a  data-name  optional  in  the
     control  footing  report description provided there is no need to
     reference the report group.  In the case where the  data-name  is
     present  the  program  compiles without error.  In the case where
     the data name is not present the compiler seems to be disallowing
     sections in the procedure division.

     DBMS error handling
     Errors which relate to the schema are not tabulated in the  error
     count, and they go only to the TTY.

     If "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON x" where x is  "INPUT",  "OUTPUT
     or  "I-O"  and  "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON file-name" are both
     specified, then file-name may not be OPENed for x.

     User error is not diagnosed:  When the value of an 88-level  item
     is  not the correct class, and the item is subordinate to a group
     item which has the clause "USAGE INDEX", the program will compile
     without an error diagnostic.

3.3                 SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE:


     Because of a problem in the TOPS-20 monitor, records updated in a
     file  via  SMU  mode  which  cause  the  length of the file to be
     extended by one program will not be found by  other  users  until
     both  programs  close  and  reopen  the  file.   To overcome this
     restriction for ISAM files, the ISAM utility sets the  file  size
     for  .IDX  and  .IDA  files  to  +infinity (2**35 -1) in the file
     descriptor block (FDB).  Please  note  that  the  files  physical
     length  is  the correct number of bytes written.  The file's size
     in pages is displayed correctly by VDIRECTORY.

     This fix allows simultaneous update users to process  ISAM  files
     correctly.   However  some  programs or TOPS-20 commands (such as
     FILCOM or QUEUE LPT:  = FILE/PRINT:OCTAL) which attempt to access
     the file sequentially will run improperly - they will run and run
     and run...

     A special purpose utility SETEOF.EXE is included  in  the  BINARY
     save  set.  SETEOF may be used to extend the file size in the FDB
     to a large, user specified size or  to  reduce  a  file  with  an
     extended file size to the actual file size (rounded upward to the
     next  page).   This  will  allow  users  of   random   files   in
     simultaneous   update   mode  to  extend  the  file  size  before
     processing.  Conversely, if a user wishes to sequentially process
     a  file  with  an extended file size, the user may use SETEOF and
     specify a file size of "0" to reduce the file to the actual  file
     size (rounded upward to the next page).
