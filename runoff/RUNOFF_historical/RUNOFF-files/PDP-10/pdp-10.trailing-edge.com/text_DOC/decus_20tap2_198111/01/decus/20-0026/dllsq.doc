SUBROUTINE DLLSQ

PURPOSE
   TO SOLVE LINEAR LEAST SQUARES PROBLEMS, I.E. TO MINIMIZE
   THE EUCLIDEAN NORM OF B-A*X, WHERE A IS A M BY N MATRIX
   WITH M NOT LESS THAN N. IN THE SPECIAL CASE M=N SYSTEMS OF
   LINEAR EQUATIONS MAY BE SOLVED.

USAGE
   CALL DLLSQ (A,B,M,N,L,X,IPIV,EPS,IER,AUX)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   A	  - DOUBLE PRECISION M BY N COEFFICIENT MATRIX
	    (DESTROYED).
   B	  - DOUBLE PRECISION M BY L RIGHT HAND SIDE MATRIX
	    (DESTROYED).
   M	  - ROW NUMBER OF MATRICES A AND B.
   N	  - COLUMN NUMBER OF MATRIX A, ROW NUMBER OF MATRIX X.
   L	  - COLUMN NUMBER OF MATRICES B AND X.
   X	  - DOUBLE PRECISION N BY L SOLUTION MATRIX.
   IPIV   - INTEGER OUTPUT VECTOR OF DIMENSION N WHICH
	    CONTAINS INFORMATIONS ON COLUMN INTERCHANGES
	    IN MATRIX A. (SEE REMARK NO.3).
   EPS	  - SINGLE PRECISION INPUT PARAMETER WHICH SPECIFIES
	    A RELATIVE TOLERANCE FOR DETERMINATION OF RANK OF
	    MATRIX A.
   IER	  - A RESULTING ERROR PARAMETER.
   AUX	  - A DOUBLE PRECISION AUXILIARY STORAGE ARRAY OF
	    DIMENSION MAX(2*N,L). ON RETURN FIRST L LOCATIONS
	    OF AUX CONTAIN THE RESULTING LEAST SQUARES.

REMARKS
   (1) NO ACTION BESIDES ERROR MESSAGE IER=-2 IN CASE
       M LESS THAN N.
   (2) NO ACTION BESIDES ERROR MESSAGE IER=-1 IN CASE
       OF A ZERO-MATRIX A.
   (3) IF RANK K OF MATRIX A IS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN N BUT
       GREATER THAN 0, THE PROCEDURE RETURNS WITH ERROR CODE
       IER=K INTO CALLING PROGRAM. THE LAST N-K ELEMENTS OF
       VECTOR IPIV DENOTE THE USELESS COLUMNS IN MATRIX A.
       THE REMAINING USEFUL COLUMNS FORM A BASE OF MATRIX A.
   (4) IF THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFUL, ERROR PARAMETER IER
       IS SET TO 0.

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   HOUSEHOLDER TRANSFORMATIONS ARE USED TO TRANSFORM MATRIX A
   TO UPPER TRIANGULAR FORM. AFTER HAVING APPLIED THE SAME
   TRANSFORMATION TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE MATRIX B, AN
   APPROXIMATE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IS COMPUTED BY
   BACK SUBSTITUTION. FOR REFERENCE, SEE

   SQUARES PROBLEMS, NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK, VOL.7,
