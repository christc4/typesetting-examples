SUBROUTINE LOAD

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE A FACTOR MATRIX (LOADING) FROM EIGENVALUES AND
   ASSOCIATED EIGENVECTORS.  THIS SUBROUTINE NORMALLY OCCURS
   IN A SEQUENCE OF CALLS TO SUBROUTINES CORRE, EIGEN, TRACE,
   LOAD, AND VARMX IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A FACTOR ANALYSIS.

USAGE
   CALL LOAD (M,K,R,V)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   M	 - NUMBER OF VARIABLES.
   K	 - NUMBER OF FACTORS. K MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL
	   TO 1 AND LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO M.
   R	 - A MATRIX (SYMMETRIC AND STORED IN COMPRESSED FORM
	   WITH ONLY UPPER TRIANGLE BY COLUMN IN CORE) CON-
	   TAINING EIGENVALUES IN DIAGONAL.  EIGENVALUES ARE
	   ARRANGED IN DESCENDING ORDER, AND FIRST K
	   EIGENVALUES ARE USED BY THIS SUBROUTINE.  THE ORDER
	   OF MATRIX R IS M BY M.  ONLY M*(M+1)/2 ELEMENTS ARE
	   IN STORAGE.	(STORAGE MODE OF 1)
   V	 - WHEN THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED, MATRIX V (M X M)
	   CONTAINS EIGENVECTORS COLUMNWISE.  UPON RETURNING TO
	   THE CALLING PROGRAM, MATRIX V CONTAINS A FACTOR
	   MATRIX (M X K).

REMARKS
   NONE

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   NORMALIZED EIGENVECTORS ARE CONVERTED TO THE FACTOR PATTERN
   BY MULTIPLYING THE ELEMENTS OF EACH VECTOR BY THE SQUARE
   ROOT OF THE CORRESPONDING EIGENVALUE.
