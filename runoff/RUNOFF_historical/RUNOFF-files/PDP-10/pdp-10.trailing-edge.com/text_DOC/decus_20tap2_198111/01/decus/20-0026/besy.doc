SUBROUTINE BESY

PURPOSE
   COMPUTE THE Y BESSEL FUNCTION FOR A GIVEN ARGUMENT AND ORDER

USAGE
   CALL BESY(X,N,BY,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   X  -THE ARGUMENT OF THE Y BESSEL FUNCTION DESIRED
   N  -THE ORDER OF THE Y BESSEL FUNCTION DESIRED
   BY -THE RESULTANT Y BESSEL FUNCTION
   IER-RESULTANT ERROR CODE WHERE
      IER=0  NO ERROR
      IER=1  N IS NEGATIVE
      IER=2  X IS NEGATIVE OR ZERO
      IER=3  BY HAS EXCEEDED MAGNITUDE OF 10**70

REMARKS
   VERY SMALL VALUES OF X MAY CAUSE THE RANGE OF THE LIBRARY
   FUNCTION ALOG TO BE EXCEEDED
   X MUST BE GREATER THAN ZERO
   N MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO ZERO

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   NONE

METHOD
   RECURRENCE RELATION AND POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUE
   AS DESCRIBED BY A.J.M.HITCHCOCK,'POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATIONS
