SUBROUTINE PDIV

PURPOSE
   DIVIDE ONE POLYNOMIAL BY ANOTHER

USAGE
   CALL PDIV(P,IDIMP,X,IDIMX,Y,IDIMY,TOL,IER)

DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS
   P	 - RESULTANT VECTOR OF INTEGRAL PART
   IDIMP - DIMENSION OF P
   X	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR DIVIDEND POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER. IT IS
	   REPLACED BY REMAINDER AFTER DIVISION.
   IDIMX - DIMENSION OF X
   Y	 - VECTOR OF COEFFICIENTS FOR DIVISOR POLYNOMIAL,
	   ORDERED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST POWER
   IDIMY - DIMENSION OF Y
   TOL	 - TOLERANCE VALUE BELOW WHICH COEFFICIENTS ARE
	   ELIMINATED DURING NORMALIZATION
   IER	 - ERROR CODE. 0 IS NORMAL, 1 IS FOR ZERO DIVISOR

REMARKS
   THE REMAINDER R REPLACES X.
   THE DIVISOR Y REMAINS UNCHANGED.
   IF DIMENSION OF Y EXCEEDS DIMENSION OF X, IDIMP IS SET TO
   ZERO AND CALCULATION IS BYPASSED

SUBROUTINES AND FUNCTION SUBPROGRAMS REQUIRED
   PNORM

METHOD
   POLYNOMIAL X IS DIVIDED BY POLYNOMIAL Y GIVING INTEGER PART
   P AND REMAINDER R SUCH THAT X = P*Y + R.
   DIVISOR Y AND REMAINDER  VECTOR GET NORMALIZED.
