1.0  SUMMARY

This is the the first maintenance release of COBOL-68 Version  12  and
COBOL-74  version  12.   It is the first release of common sources for
both compilers.

COBOL version 12A consists of:
        COBOL    version 12A(726)
        CBL74    version 12A(726)
        LIBOL    version 12A(604)

        LIBARY   version 12A(30)
        RERUN    version 12A(6)

The above software will run on all supported  monitors  and  has  been
tested under TOPS-10 6.03A and 7.00.

This release  contains  the  common  sources  for  both  COBOL-68  and
COBOL-74.

COBOL-74 version 12A conforms to the full ANSI  highest  level  except
for:

EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


2.9  SYNTACTIC and SEMANTIC CHANGES NOT YET DOCUMENTED

COMPUTE Statement

         Internal support for double precision floating point has been
         added  to  both the compiler and OTS.  There is a new feature
         test  switch  BISCMP  which,  if  on,  causes   all   COMPUTE
         statements  to coerce the data into double precision floating
         point.  In this version the feature test  is  OFF.   This  is
         because  the  code has not had sufficient testing, however if
         anyone turns it on and tries it out, we  will  fix  any  bugs
         found.   This  code  will only work on KL CPUs.  There are no
         plans to add double precision floating point as  an  external
         data type.

VARIABLE LENGTH SEQUENTIAL RECORDS

         Version  12A  correctly  reads  and  writes  variable  length
         sequential records.
         The simplest way to describe the record is as:
         01 record PIC X OCCURS n TIMES DEPENDING ON data-name-1.
         Where data-name-1 is not part of the record.
         On WRITE all that has to be done is to setup  data-name-1  to
         the  correct size and do the WRITE.  On READ data-name-1 will
         be setup correctly after the READ so that the user  can  tell
         how big the record was.

OPEN EXTEND

         This is the COBOL-74 OPEN EXTEND syntax.  It allows the  user
         to append to a sequential file to either DSK or MTA.

DISPLAY IS DISPLAY-6/7/9

         This clause has been added to the OBJECT  COMPUTER  paragraph
         to  allow  the  user  to set the default DISPLAY mode.  It is
         similar to /X but also allows DISPLAY-7.

WRITE record FROM SPACES

         This is an extension of WRITE record FROM data-name.
         It is equivalent to
         MOVE SPACES TO record.
         WRITE record.

CHECKPOINT OUTPUT

         The original syntax was:
         ACCESS MODE IS INDEXED CHECKPOINT OUTPUT
         at user's requests the syntax was expanded  to  cover  RANDOM
         and SEQUENTIAL also.
         The action is to do a CHECKPOINT  FILOP  after  every  output
         which  is  equivalent  to,  but  much  faster  than,  a CLOSE
         followed by  an  OPEN.   This  should  greatly  increase  the
COBOL-68/COBOL-74 V12A Documentation                           Page 14
EXTERNAL CHANGES and OPTIONS


         reliability of ISAM files at the expense of performance.

BYTE MODE

         This was in version 12 but undocumented.  The syntax is
         RECORDING MODE IS BYTE MODE [ASCII, SIXBIT, ...]
         If BYTE MODE is used, the exact number of bytes is written on
         the  tape,  it  does  not  round up to the the word boundary.
         This is valid only on magnetic tape.

DENSITY IS 6250

         Allow the syntax for mag tape density of 6250 bpi.

SELECT file-name ASSIGN TO literal-1

         This is an extension of the SELECT statement to allow devices
         that  look  like  COBOL  reserved words to be used.  Note the
         literal must be a legal TOPS-10 style device name, no "-" for
         example.

DEFICIENCES


3.0  DEFICIENCIES


3.1  NEW Deficiencies from COBOL v12


     COPY REPLACING has some problems in that it is  not  possible  to
     replace either part of PIC xyz without replacing the whole.
     i.e.  REPLACING ==PIC S9(10)==
     will work
     but
     REPLACING ==PIC== or REPLACING ==S9(10)== will not.

     Note, it was never  the  intent  (and  it  contravenes  the  ANSI
     standard) for COPY REPLACING to replace part of a data-item.
     REPLACING AA by BB should not turn AA-XYZ into BB-XYZ.

     Programs  which  contain  nested   SEARCH   statements   generate
     instructions  which jump to themselves.  These instructions never
     get executed so the program works, however the optimizer does not
     know  how to handle them and goes into an infinite loop.  For now
     do not optimize programs which contain nested SEARCHes.

     The LINK supplied with 7.00 for loading the monitor will not load
     COBOL-74  subroutines,  COBOL-68 is OK.  Use field image LINK for
     this case.

     In COBOL-74 the statement
     PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE IS EBCDIC 
     is not supported even though the manual implies that it is.

     MULTIPLY A BY B GIVING C ON SIZE ERROR ...  *(1)
     where A, B and C are double precision (BIS only) has a problem in
     that  the  compiler  generates code which, because of the ON SIZE
     ERROR code, assumes that the conversion from 4-words to COMP  has
     already taken place so the wrong data is stored.  Correct code is
     generated if ON SIZE ERROR is not used or the  intermediate  temp
     is not bigger than 18 digits.

     DIVIDE A BY B GIVING C  *(1)
     where A, B and C are double precision COMP  and  have  sufficient
     decimal  places  so  that A must be adjusted to be bigger than 18
     digits so as not to lose precision (BIS only) then  the  compiler
     generates  wrong  code  for  the  divide  by  B.  Note, this only
     happens if B is COMP.

     MULTIPLY/DIVIDE A BY B GIVING C  *(1)
     where A, B and C are double precision and where the  intermediate
     temp  is  4-words  (BIS  only) and has more decimal places than C
     then wrong results are generated when A and B have opposite sign.

     CATASTROPHE IN PHASE C  *(1)
     If the FD has a RECORD CONTAINS clause but no  data  record  then
     the compiler will get a fatal error when it tries to diagnose the

*(1)   Untested patches  exist  for  these  problems.   They  will  be
published  after  version  12A  is  released  when  they have had more
testing.

     We do not reccomend that this change  be  installed  unless  your
     installation  is  having  problems  transfering  data  TO  an IBM
     machine.

     The ASCII to EBCDIC translation table was changed in  version  12
     (as  the  result  of  several  SPRs)  so  that the translation of
     graphics was more correct.   However  it  is  still  not  correct
     according  to  IBM  documentation, we are currently investigating
     what VAX does to see if there can be a DEC to IBM standard we can
     live  with.   However it seems that we now in some cases generate
     incorrect EBCDIC characters for minus zero.  The interim solution
     for  those  who  see this problem is to put the translation table
     back the  way  it  was  in  version  11  knowing  then  that  the
     translation of some graphics will be wrong.

3.2  OLD Deficiencies from before COBOL v12


     Program ID same as filename, procedure name or data name  results
     in spurious error messages.

     If A=B and C=D or E for subscripted A and  C  gives  wrong  code,
     cause "SUBSCRIPT not POSITIVE" run time message if subscripts not
     COMP or INDEX.

     Using argument  missing  in  call  statement  gives  wrong  error
     message.

     Misspelled column not handled properly in the report section.

     Error not detected.
     A RESET FINAL clause is legitimate only when FINAL is given as  a
     control.   Violation  of  this  rule  goes  undiagnosed.  A RESET
     clause  can  only  accompany  a  sum  clause.   A  RESET   clause
     accompanying a source clause receives no diagnostic.

     Incorrect error message.
     DATA-NAME RC which is defined on last line of the working-storage
     section is incorrectly diagnosed as undefined in the declaratives
     area of procedure division.  It is considered to be defined ok in
     the report section, however.

     Incorrect error message.
     COBOL rules make the presence of  a  data-name  optional  in  the
     control  footing  report description provided there is no need to
     reference the report group.  In the case where the  data-name  is
     present  the  program  compiles without error.  In the case where
     the data name is not present the compiler seems to be disallowing
     sections in the procedure division.

     DBMS error handling
     Errors which relate to the schema are not tabulated in the  error
     count, and they go only to the TTY.

     If "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON x" where x is  "INPUT",  "OUTPUT
     or  "I-O"  and  "USE AFTER ERROR PROCEDURE ON file-name" are both
     specified, then file-name may not be OPENed for x.

4.0  Installation Instructions


See  the  COBOL-68/74  Installation  Guide  (COBOL.INS)  for  complete
installation instructions.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES


5.1  I/O Performance Metering

A new feature test switch, LSTATS and two new modules, METUNV.MAC  and
METIO.MAC have been added to do OTS performance analysis.  The feature
test switch is OFF in  this  release,  however  the  save  set  LSTATS
contains  a KL-10 version of the OTS with this feature turned on.  See
IOPERF.MEM for details.


5.2  Misc.

1. The DATE and TIME routines have been moved from CBLIO.MAC to a  new
   routine TODAY.MAC.
2. The floating point conversion routines FLOT.1 and FLOT.2 have  been
   combined into one module FLOAT.
3. Most of the numeric constants in CBLIO.MAC have  been  replaced  by
   symbolic constants and the TX and MOVX macros have been used.
4. Wherever possible symbol definitions have been moved from CBLIO and
   other modules into the appropriate UNV file.
5. The module UUO.MAC is no longer required and has been deleted.
