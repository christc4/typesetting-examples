2.0 NEW FEATURES IN Version 5

Some specific new features in Version 5 are as follows:


2.1 Extended-addressing support

There  were  some  facilities  in  Version  4  that  allowed
programmers  to  make limited use of the hardware facilities
of extended addressing.  These software facilities were  not
formally  supported,  and  could only be enabled by patching
the distributed TOPS-20 monitor.

Version   5    contains    a    full    implementation    of
extended-addressing support.  These facilities are available
currently only to the  Macro  programmer.   Future  language
support  for  these  facilities  is planned.  The facilities
that were available in Version 4 have been expanded and  are
now  a  fully  supported  portion  of  the  monitor.   These
facilities  allow  programmers  to  create  and   manipulate
multi-section  address  spaces.   Please consult the TOPS-20
Monitor Calls Reference Manual, Monitor Calls User's  Guide,
and Processor Reference Manual for more information relating
to the monitor support for extended-addressing.

There have been some additional enhancements made in several
programs which give the user greater control over the use of
multi-section programs.  These features are contained in the
following products:

          a.  DDT

          A new switch has been added to  the  DDT  command.
          The syntax is:

             @DDT/USE-SECTION:n

          where "n" is the number of  the  extended  section
          that  DDT  is to be loaded into by the EXEC.  This
          feature allows easier debugging of programs  which
          are running in a non-zero section.

          b.  EXEC

          A new switch has also been added to  the  GET  and
          MERGE commands which is similar in function to the
          switch described above.  Its syntax is:

             @MERGE file.typ/USE-SECTION:n

             @GET file.typ/USE-SECTION:n

          In addition, the EXEC can now  save  multi-section
          programs   in   their  entirety,  or  any  portion
          thereof.
                                                      Page 5


          Refer to the  TOPS-20  Commands  Reference  Manual
          Update   for   information  on  the  /USE-SECTION:
          switch.

          c.  LINK

          The LINK program has also been enhanced so that it
          can   now  link  multi-section  programs.   Please
          consult the  LINK  Reference  Manual  for  further
          information.


2.2 Homogeneous Network Command Terminals for DECnet-20 V2.1

Version 5 includes support for homogeneous command terminals
through  the  use of a new SETHOST feature.  This feature is
implemented through the use  of  a  program  called  SETHOST
which  enables  a  timesharing  user  to establish a logical
DECnet link to another TOPS-20 system  which  is  physically
connected  to  the  user's  primary  system.   All  terminal
interactions which this user initiates will subsequently  be
processed  by  the  "linked-to"  system.  This allows a user
whose terminal is physically connected to one system  to  be
able to log in, issue commands, and run programs on a second
system exactly as if the terminal was  physically  connected
to  that  second system.  There is an escape character which
allows the connection to be broken and interaction with  the
primary system re-established.

Refer to the DECnet-20  Programmer's  Guide  and  Operations
Manual for documentation on the SETHOST program.


2.3 RP07 Disk Drive

The RP07 disk  drive  is  a  single  spindle,  705  megabyte
(unformatted),  fixed media, Winchester technolgy, disk with
Massbus interface.  It will now be fully supported  for  use
with TOPS-20 Version 5.  The primary features of this device
are:


     1.  Internal microdiagnostics

     2.  rotational position sensing

     3.  1.92MB/sec peak transfer rate

     4.  average seek time of 23 ms.

     5.  defect skipping

     6.  static dual-port capability

     7.  formatted capacity of 216376 pages (499 MByte)
                                                      Page 6


Unlike the RP20 disk, an RP07 can  be  used  as  the  public
structure  (PS:).   However, an RP06 drive is still required
in order to contain the front-end file system.

Refer to the TOPS-20 System Manager's Guide and the  TOPS-20
Operator's Guide for information on the RP07.

2.4 SPEAR support

SPEAR is an error reporting and analysis mechanism which  is
being released and supported with Version 5.  SPEAR replaces
the program SYSERR which was included with  TOPS-20  Version
4.   There have been many changes within TOPS-20 in order to
actually support the functionality of  SPEAR,  but  most  of
these  changes  are  transparent  to  the  user.   There is,
however, a change in the directory in  which  the  ERROR.SYS
file  resides.   It is now PS:<SYSTEM-ERROR>, system logical
name SERR:.

Refer to the SPEAR Manual for complete  information  on  the
use of this product.

2.5 Movement of disk packs

TOPS-20 will support the automatic recognition of disk  pack
movement  between  drives in Version 5.  This implies that a
disk pack which is mounted on  a  particular  drive  can  be
moved  to  another  drive  without  requiring the pack to be
formally DISMOUNTed and MOUNTed again on the  second  drive.
The  monitor will automatically recognize that the disk pack
has been moved, and will adjust its internal  data  base  so
that  all  access  to the pack will be redirected to the new
drive.

2.6 "Read unrestricted" file mode

A new file access mode has been implemented  in  Version  5.
This  mode  is  called  "read unrestricted" mode and implies
that the file can be opened regardless of its current access
by  other  users  of  the  file.   This mode is indicated by
setting the bit  OF%RDU  in  the  OPENF  operation.   Please
consult   the   Monitor  Calls  Reference  Manual  for  more
information.

2.7 Archiving enhancements

The  archiving  system  has  been   enhanced   through   the
implementation  of  a  number  of new commands and directory
functions.   These   changes   relate   primarily   to   the
introduction  of  an  expiration  date for each file, either
online or offline.  A general discussion of  file  archiving
and  migration  can  be  found in the System Manager's Guide
update.

The following  is  a  summary  list  of  the  new  archiving
                                                      Page 7


features:

     1.  BUILD  command  OFFLINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT   option
         ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES option

     2.  SET FILE EXPIRED

     3.  SET FILE ON(OFF)LINE-EXPIRATION-DATE

     4.  SET FILE RESIST

     5.  SET DIRECTORY ON(OFF)LINE-EXPIRATION-DEFAULT

Please consult the TOPS-20  Commands  Reference  update  for
details of the use of these commands.

2.8 Program data vector

Version 5 supports the creation and manipulation of "program
data  vectors".   These vectors contain information relating
to the characteristics of the program (for example, starting
and   continuation   address,   etc).    These  vectors  are
manipulated through the use of a  new  JSYS  called  PDVOP%.
Refer  to  the Monitor Calls Reference Manual for details of
this feature.

2.9 Miscellaneous EXEC enhancements

There are several  miscellaneous  commands  that  have  been
added to the EXEC in Version 5.  Please refer to the TOPS-20
Commands Reference Manual update for full details  of  these
new commands.

One new EXEC command that merits particular attention is

@TERMINAL PAUSE (ON) CHARACTER char (AND UNPAUSE ON) char

This command should be used by all TOPs-20 users,  typically
in   LOGIN.CMD   files,   to   define  their  desired  pause
characters.  Even if you want to continue using S and Q, you
should define them in this manner.  The command @INFORMATION
TERMINAL-MODE now displays these settings.

Also, a user logging into TOPS-20 over DECnet will have A as
the  default  PAUSE  and UNPAUSE character;  you may use the
@TERMINAL PAUSE CHARACTER command to change them just as you
can on a local terminal, but you may not select S and Q.

In general, users should get out of the habit of using S and
Q  because  some  terminals  now  and  many terminals in the
future will not send these characters.



2.10 System Message Levels
                                                      Page 8


There are various advisory messages sent by  the  system  to
all terminals.  These are divided into two categories:  less
important (level 0) and  more  important  (level  1).   With
TOPS-20, Version 5, the system administrator can control the
type of messages sent to all user terminals.

The following messages are level 0:

      o Swapping space low.

      o SPT space low.

      o PS:  space low.

The following messages are level 1:

      o Shutdown messages for a shutdown more than 5 minutes
      away.

      o PS:  automatic expunge.

The following messages are always sent:

      o  Initial shutdown  message  and  automatic  shutdown
         announcements for shutdown 5 minutes or less away.

The system administrator can decide to allow  only  level  0
messages,  only  level  1 messages, both level 0 and level 1
messages, or neither level 0 or level 1 messages to be  sent
to  all  user  terminals.  System messages of all levels are
always sent to the Operator's CTY.

Under TOPS-20, Version 5, message level control is available
only through the SMON% JSYS.



2.10.1 Why Suppress Any System Messages

System messages are a very important part of  the  monitor's
attempt to provide system status information to users and to
the operators.  However, system messages can be  distracting
and  annoying  for  users,  especially  when the user is not
directly affected.

Level  0  system  messages  do  not  usually   deliver   any
significant  information  to users.  A message that swapping
space is low may indicate to the proficient  user  a  reason
for  degraded  response  time,  but  may  only  confuse  and
intimidate the general user population.

Level 1 messages, on  the  other  hand,  provide  meaningful
information  for all users.  Knowing that system shutdown is
scheduled in two hours may allow  users  to  make  important
scheduling decisions, while warnings of automatic expunge on
                                                      Page 9


the public structure will allow users  to  quickly  undelete
important files.

With TOPS-20, Version 5, the system administrator can decide
whether  the  minor  annoyance  of  interruption  by  system
messages outweighs the importance of the message.


2.10.2 Controlling System Messages

Two new functions have been defined for the SMON% JSYS:

      o .SFMS0 (function code 24) for system message level 0

      o .SFMS1 (function code 25) for system  message  level
      1.

In addition, flags for these functions  have  been  defined.
Flag  SF%MS0  indicates message level 0 turned on;  that is,
user terminals will receive all  level  0  system  messages.
Flag  SF%MS1  indicates message level 1 turned on;  that is,
user terminals will receive all level 1 system messages.

To set or clear system message levels, use a short  MACRO-20
routine  or  DDT.   As  with other SMON% functions, WHEEL or
OPERATOR privileges must be enabled.

A separate SMON% call  must  be  issued  for  each  function
setting  desired.   To  use the SMON% JSYS, AC1 must contain
the desired function code, and  AC2  must  contain  the  new
value for the specified function.

Refer to the TOPS-20 Monitor Calls Reference Manual for more
information on using the SMON% JSYS.



2.10.3 Determining The Current Settings For  System  Message
Levels

The current settings for system message levels can be tested
with  the  TMON% JSYS.  The function codes are the same.  As
with SMON%, the TMON% JSYS requires a function code in  AC1.
The  current  value  of  the  function  specified  in AC1 is
returned in AC2.

Refer to the TOPS-20 Monitor Calls Reference Manual for more
information on using the TMON% JSYS.

3.0 PACKAGING FOR TOPS-20 VERSION 5

There are some minor differences in the packaging of Version
5   in   comparison   to   the   packaging   of  Version  4.
Specifically, the  following  packaging  changes  have  been
made:


     1.  The  Version  5  Installation  tape  contains   all
         supported  TOPS-20  monitors.  That is, there is no
         separate ARPA monitor tape as there was in  Version
         4.   DX20 and RP20 microcode have been shipped on a
         separate tape.

     2.  The <NEW-SYSTEM> and <NEW-SUBSYS> directories  have
         NOT  been  duplicated on the Version 5 Installation
         and  Distribution  tapes,  as  was  the  case  with
         Version  4.  These directories do NOT appear on the
         Version 5 Distribution tape;  they are only on  the
         Installation tape.

     3.  There  is  a  new  saveset   on   the   Version   5
         Installation  tape  called  <GALAXY-SUBSYS>.   This
         directory contains all the Galaxy components,  both
         in  UNV  and EXE format.  The Galaxy sources remain
         in a separate saveset  on  the  Distribution  tape.
         Note  that  the Galaxy included on this tape is the
         Version 4 Galaxy (i.e., field-image).
