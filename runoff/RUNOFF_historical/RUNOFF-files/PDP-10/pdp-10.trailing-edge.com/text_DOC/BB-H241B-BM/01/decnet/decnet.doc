DECNET.DOC -- Changes from DECnet-20 V1 to DECnet-20 V2
February 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

     DECnet-20 Version 2 is a  major  functional  release.   It
provides significant functional improvement to the DECsystem-20
implementation of the corporate  Digital  Network  Architecture
Phase  II  DECnet family.  DECnet-20 consists of three separate
products, shipped on three distribution tapes:   DECnet-20  V2,
DECnet-20  V2  for  2020,  and  RJE-20 V1.  This version of the
DECnet-20 product set provides the following new features:

      o  Support for up to 8  synchronous  lines  on  the  DN20
         front end.

      o  DECnet error logging for  various  line  and  hardware
         errors detected by the DN20 front end.

      o  A DECnet compatible Remote Job Entry station  for  use
         with DECsystem-20.

      o  Installation specific network configuration using  the
         tools provided with this release.

      o  A DECnet Network File Transfer capability.

      o  Additional  NCP  (Network  Control  Program)  commands
         implemented  as  part of the TOPS-20 standard operator
         command interface.

      o  Network  topology  information  available  through   a
         TOPS-20 EXEC command.

      o  Compatibility with DECnet Phase II and III.


     This version supersedes DECnet-20  Version  1.   Many  new
features of this release require a DN20 with 128K of MOS memory
and do not apply to the DECsystem-2020.  A  32K  DN20  will  be
supported  with only a single synchronous line, but most of the
new maintainability features will not be available.

     DECnet-20 Version 2 is documented  fully  in  the  TOPS-20
DECnet-20  Programmer's  Guide  and  Operations  Manual,  Order
Number AA-5091B-TM.  RJE-20 is documented in the TOPS-20  DN200
Remote  Station  Guide, Order Number AA-H786A-TM.  In addition,
the following manuals provide generic DECnet  information  that
may be useful:

      o  DIGITAL  NETWORK  ARCHITECTURE,  General  Description,
         Order Number AA-H202A-TK.  Provides a general overview
         of DNA.
DECNET.DOC -- DOC file for DECnet-20 V2                  Page 3


      o  DDCMP, Order Number AA-D599A-TC.  Provides a  complete
         specification  of the data link level protocol used in
         DNA.

      o  NSP, Order Number AA-D600A-TC.   Provides  a  complete
         specification of the Network Services Protocol.

      o  DAP, Order Number AA-D601B-TC.   Provides  a  complete
         specification  of  the  Data  Access  Protocol.   This
         revision of the specification is not available  as  of
         this writing.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Support for up to 8 Synchronous Lines

     DECnet-20 Version 2 supports up to 8 synchronous lines  on
a   DN20   front   end   attached  to  a  DECsystem-2040/50/60.
Communication devices supported  on  the  DN20  are  DMC11  and
KMC11/DUP11  (KDP).   Only a single DMC11 or DUP11 (not KDP) is
supported  on  a  32K  DN20.   The  DECsystem-2020  supports  2
synchronous  lines using KMC11/DUP11 devices.  Remote Job Entry
(DN200)  stations  are  configured  with  DMC11   communication
devices.



2.2  DECnet Error Logging

     This version logs network related line errors detected  by
the  DN20,  front  end reloads, and network topology changes in
ERROR.SYS, the TOPS-20 system error file.  Control  over  error
event  logging  functions is provided by a set of NCP commands.
SYSERR allows the network manager to  selectively  display  the
contents of the network error entries, in order to maintain his
network and track its behavior.



2.3  DN200 Remote Job Entry Station

     The DN200 Remote Job Entry Station  provides  remote  line
printer,  card reader, and operator command terminal capability
for the DECsystem-20.  TOPS-20 batch jobs prepared  on  punched
cards  can be submitted to a host TOPS-20 system for execution.
Spooled output from a host TOPS-20 system can be routed to  the
remote  line  printer for printing.  The operator at the remote
station has control over the remote devices.  Downline  loading
of  the  DN200  system  image is accomplished over the physical
communications line to the host.



2.4  Installation-Tailored DN20 Network Software Generation

     Building of the system image, which  is  loaded  into  the
DN20 front end, is performed onsite for Version 2.  Using tools
provided with this release, the  customer  or  Digital  support
personnel   can   describe  specific  parameters  and  hardware
configuration  using  a  network  system  generation   program,
NETGEN, which creates a tailored set of assembler source files.
These source files are then assembled, on the  TOPS-20  system,
using  the  assembler,  DNMAC, to produce installation specific
object files.  These object files and  the  distributed  object
files  are linked using a task builder, TKB20, to produce a set
of symbol files, map files, and task image files.  VNP20 merges
DECNET.DOC -- DOC file for DECnet-20 V2                  Page 5
February 1980


the  resultant task image files to produce a final system image
file to be loaded into the DN20.  Configurable items  that  can
be  specified  during  the  generation procedure includes:  the
line device types to be used, the node name, the maximum number
of logical links, maximum buffer quotas, etc.



2.5  DECnet File Transfer Utilities

     Two  programs,  NFT  and  FAL,  provide  the  DECnet  file
transfer  capability  for  DECsystem-20.   Access  to  files on
remote systems from the local TOPS-20 system is provided by NFT
(Network  File  Transfer).   Commands  provided  are  COPY, SET
DEFAULT, INFORMATION, SUBMIT, DIRECTORY, and DELETE.  FAL (File
Access  Listener)  acts  as  the  DECnet  server  process which
provides access to the local  hosts  TOPS-20  file  system  for
remote network nodes.



2.6  NCP Operator Commands

     Three commands have been added to the NCP command set  and
two  options  have  been added to the SHOW command.  The ENABLE
EVENT-LOGGING and  DISABLE  EVENT-LOGGING  commands  have  been
added   to   allow  control  of  the  logging  of  error  event
information on a device basis.  The SHOW STATUS  LOCAL  command
provides  parameter  information  pertaining  to  the node that
executes the command.  The SHOW  STATUS  LINE  or  SHOW  STATUS
KNOWN   LINES   command   provides  status  information  for  a
particular line or lines.



2.7  EXEC Command Support for DECnet Topology Information

     An INFORMATION (ABOUT) DECNET command has  been  added  to
the  TOPS-20  EXEC  to provide the DECnet user with the list of
nodes that are currently accessible to his TOPS-20 system.  The
information  for  this  command  is  maintained  by the TOPS-20
Monitor and updated by  NETCON,  the  program  that  implements
NCP/NCU  for  DECsystem-20.   A  task  that  runs  on  the DN20
provides the information to NETCON.



2.8  Compatibility with DECnet Phase III

     This version of DECnet-20 is compatible with DECnet  Phase
III.    Compatibility   with   DECnet-20  Version  1  has  been
maintained,  however,  the  internal  implementation  has  been
changed considerably.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     Major  problems  with  DECnet-20  Version  2,  that  might
prevent successful installation or operation, are documented in
the DECnet-20 Beware File.  This file, DECNET.BWR,  is  in  the
documentation  save  set  on the distribution tape.  The Beware
File is mandatory reading prior to installing this product.

     Minor problems with this version that should not interfere
with normal operation of this product are documented here.



3.1  DN20 Bugs and Deficiencies

3.1.1  DN20 Crashes on NSP Message with Null Node Name

     An NSP message received by the DN20 with a null node  name
causes  NSP  to  overwrite storage and the DN20 will ultimately
crash.  Under normal circumstances this situation is not likely
to occur and therefore should not present a problem.



3.1.2  No Link Abort when TOPS-20 Host Crashes

     No timeouts  are  done  for  transmits  across  the  DTE20
interface between the DN20 and the host TOPS-20 system.  If the
host TOPS-20 system crashes, any  existing  links  through  the
DN20  will  just  'hang' and never be aborted by the DN20.  Any
connections for the host TOPS-20 node will be  trapped  by  the
DN20  with  no  connect confirm returned.  The connections will
remain hung until the remote user aborts them  or  the  TOPS-20
host reloads the DN20.



3.2  NFT/FAL Bugs and Deficiencies

3.2.1  Truncation of Byte Count in DIRECTORY Output

     A DIRECTORY command truncates the byte count and byte size
field  to 10 characters.  Thus, if the byte count requires more
than 10 character positions, some digits may not be displayed.



3.2.2  No Facility to Expunge a Remote Directory

     The DELETE command does NOT do an expunge after  deletion.
If  you get an over quota type error from NFT when transferring
files to a remote node, you cannot get under quota by using NFT
to  delete  files  from the remote node, because the disk space
will still be in use.  To get around this problem, delete  some
DECNET.DOC -- DOC file for DECnet-20 V2                  Page 7
February 1980


files,  and  then submit a 'null' batch job on the remote node.
The files will be expunged when the batch job logs out.



3.2.3  No Facility to Set Default SUBMIT Switches

     The NFT SUBMIT command has no switches, and  there  is  no
way  to  override any default switches on the remote node.  The
standard defaults for  the  SUBMIT  command,  provided  by  the
remote system, will be obtained.



3.2.4  Incorrect Wildcard Handling in COPY Command

     Under certain conditions NFT copies to a  directory  other
than the one intended in the command.  The following conditions
cause the file to be copied to the connected directory, not the
directory specified in the command:

      o  The direction of the copy is from remote node to local
         node.

      o  The source file specification contains a wildcard.

      o  The  target   file   specification's   structure   and
         directory  are  different  from  the  user's connected
         directory.


     For user <MIERSWA>, connected  to  NET:<MIERSWA.MEM>,  the
following can happen:

NFT>COPY 4097::LOGIN.* PS:<OPERATOR>LOGIN.*.-1
4097::PS:<MIERSWA>LOGIN.CMD.1 => NET:<MIERSWA.MEM>LOGIN.CMD.1 [OK]




3.3  NCP/NCU (NETCON) Bugs and Deficiencies

3.3.1  Server Links Required by NETCON

     A minimum of five server logical  links  are  required  by
NETCON  to  function properly:  four NCU servers and one server
link for topology notification.  NETCON issues an error message
when it is unable to establish the topology server, however, no
error message is issued when it  fails  to  establish  the  NCU
server links.  NETCON may be unable to open enough servers as a
result of a shortage of system resources and may appear  to  be
operating  correctly  when in fact it is not.  A possible cause
for the depletion of the  system  resource  pool  may  be  that
establishment  of  the  maximum number of server links had been
DECNET.DOC -- DOC file for DECnet-20 V2                  Page 8
February 1980


reached.  The solution, in this case, is to close  some  server
links and restart NETCON.



3.3.2  CHK11 Entries Truncated in SYSERR File

     Some of the text output produced by  the  CHK11  bootstrap
program  during  load of the DN20 is truncated when written, by
NETCON, into the ERROR.SYS  file  on  the  TOPS-20  host.   The
amount lost is variable but is always truncated from the end of
the text.



3.3.3  Incorrect Line Counter Output

     The line counter display provided  by  NETCON  incorrectly
shows counter values over 127 as a number in the range 65000 to
65535.  To reduce the probability of this problem occuring  set
the  logging  interval  to  a  value  that will ensure the line
counters are read and zeroed before they reach 128.



3.3.4  Restriction of SHOW STATE LOCAL Command

     A SHOW STATE LOCAL command to a DN20 node always shows the
node  number  as zero even when the node number is generated as
nonzero.  If the DN20 configuration image was saved at the time
the DN20 was generated, then the node number may be obtained by
running NETGEN, using the RESTORE command to read in the  saved
configuration, and using the INFORMATION command to display the
node information.



3.4  TOPS-20 NSP Bugs and Deficiencies

3.4.1  MTOPR Disconnect Function always Aborts

     The MTOPR .MOCLZ function with a  zero  disconnect  reason
code  does  not  do  a  synchronous  disconnect when used after
sending data in stream mode.  Any data which has not  yet  been
transmitted  by  NSP  at  the  time the MTOPR is issued will be
lost.   The  CLOSF  JSYS  will  work   properly   under   these
circumstances.
DECNET.DOC -- DOC file for DECnet-20 V2                  Page 9
February 1980


3.5  RJE-20 Bugs and Deficiencies

3.5.1  Reversion of DN200 RJE Operator Service to Host

     If the operator services logical link from the host to the
DN200  RJE  station  is  aborted  for  any reason, all operator
service messages destined for the DN200  are  rerouted  to  the
host  TOPS-20  operator  service  program  OPR.   If  a message
requiring a response is rerouted to the host, then it  must  be
answered  by  the host system operator.  The DN200 RJE operator
will not be able to respond to it.

     In addition, the logical link for DN200 operator  services
may  not  be  automatically reestablished.  To restore operator
services at the DN200 RJE station the remote  station  operator
should  periodically  attempt to issue a command at the LA36 to
force the reconnection.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

5.1  Changes from DECnet-20 V1 to DECnet-20 V2

     Numerous internal changes and additions have been made for
DECnet-20  Version  2,  both  within  TOPS-20  and  in the DN20
software.  NSPSRV has been divided into three modules:  NSPPAR,
a  parameter  file;   FILNSP, the file system interface to NSP;
and NSPSRV the file containing the network specific portion  of
NSP  on  TOPS-20.  Some data base restructuring has occurred in
KDPSRV.  NETCON has been divided into three  modules:   NETPAR,
NCU, and NCP.  The NODE JSYS has been enhanced with several new
functions  to  provide  topology  support.   A  new  BOOT  JSYS
function was added.

     A topology reporting task, TOPOL, has been  added  to  the
DN20.   Device  drivers were added for the KMC/DUP combination.
Several  tools  and  procedures  were  added  to  support   the
configuration   of   the  DN20  software  in  the  field.   New
functionality was developed to support the DN200 RJE station.

     Many bugs and deficiencies present in Version 1 were fixed
during the development of Version 2.

February 1980


6.0  SUGGESTIONS

6.1  DECnet Phase III Node Name Compatibility

     In DECnet Phase III all node names must include  at  least
one alphabetic character to syntactically distinguish them from
node addresses.  The alphabetic character need not be the first
character, and remaining characters may be either alphabetic or
numeric.  Customers are urged to adhere to this convention when
naming Phase II nodes, thus providing upward compatibility with
DECnet Phase III.



6.2  Documentation Required on Submission of DECnet-20 SPR's

     When submitting documentation for SPR's on DN20  problems,
the  user  MUST  submit the entire contents of the directory in
which the DN20 system image was generated.  This should include
the  complete  set  of  MAC  files, MAP files, STB files, IMAGE
files, and the DMP file along with any other description of the
problem  and  supporting  documentation.   The  dump  cannot be
analyzed without the symbol files that were  created  when  the
system image was generated.



6.3  Proper Method to Perform Line Loopback

     Use the following sequence of operations to  perform  line
loopback:

     1.  Put the line in OFF state

     2.  Place the modem in loopback

     3.  Put the line in MAINTENANCE state

     4.  Perform the LOOP LINE command until done

     5.  Put the line in OFF state

     6.  Take the modem out of loopback

     7.  Set the line state to ON
