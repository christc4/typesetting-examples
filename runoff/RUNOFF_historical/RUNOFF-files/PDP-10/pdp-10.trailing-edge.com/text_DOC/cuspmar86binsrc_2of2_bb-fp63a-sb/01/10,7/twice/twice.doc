SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

TWICE is a program which runs under the TOPS-10 monitor and is used to
change  the  ONCE-only  disk  parameters under timesharing.  TWICE has
been tested on a KL10 and a KS10 running the 7.03 monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

If TWICE is reassembled, it must be built using a HDWCNF.MAC which has
been  generated  for  a  KL10  processor with FTAUTC=-1 (the default).
Unlike previous versions, it is self configuring.  That  is,  it  will
run  on  any  configuration  without  the  need  to  build a "maximum"
configuration disk data base.  The supplied  .EXE  file  will  run  on
either a KL10 or KS10 processor with no modifications.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


        .COMPILE TWICE.REL=HDWCNF.MAC+TWICE.MAC
        .COMPILE COMMOD.REL=HDWCNF.MAC+COMMOD.MAC
        .R LINK
        *TWICE/SAVE /NOINIT = /LOCALS /SYMSEG:LOW -
        *TWICE, COMMOD, TOPS10/SEARCH/INCLUDE:EDDT /GO



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

As a result of the KLIPA/CI disk work done to the monitor,  TWICE  was
made self configuring.

Eliminate all undefined globals for the 7.03 field test.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
