MACDLX.DOC -- Changes from V622(622) to V27A(667)
April 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 27A of MACDLX is a maintenance release that fixes  minor  bugs
and aggravations.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The major change that prompts this  release  is  the  removal  of  the
restriction  on  local  labels  (e. g.  30$) forcing them to be within
branch range of the last non-global symbol (e. g. MUMBLE:).   Previous
versions  will  generate "A" errors in this case but will go ahead and
generate correct code.

When assembling a program that consists of several  files,  the  title
line on the listing will have the page number within that file.

MACDLX will now support SWITCH.INI.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

MACDLX.EXE should be put on  SYS:.   No  other  support  programs  are
necessary.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None worth mentioning.



6.0  Suggestions

Include the name of the present source file  when  printing  the  page
number of an error.



7.0  Support

MACDLX is supported as far as assembling the ANF-10 software  and  the
IBM communications software (DN6X).

1.0  FUNCTION OF MACDLX

MACDLX is a powerful MACRO assembler which runs  on  DECsystem-10  and
generates  code  for  the  PDP-11.   MACDLX should be used to generate
binary files for the DC75 and DC44.  MACDLX is  a  subset  of  MACY11.
MACY11  is  a  software  product  of Digital Equipment Corp.  The only
features in MACY11 not found in  MACDLX  are  those  which  deal  with
relocatable code.


1.1  Operation

MACDLX is used with a command string of the form:

     *DC75.BIN,DC75.LST/CRF_DC75.P11


1.2  Distribution

MACDLX.SHR is the only file provided.  No sources will be distributed.


1.3  Documentation

The MACRO-11 Programmers Manual describes the MACRO-11 language.
