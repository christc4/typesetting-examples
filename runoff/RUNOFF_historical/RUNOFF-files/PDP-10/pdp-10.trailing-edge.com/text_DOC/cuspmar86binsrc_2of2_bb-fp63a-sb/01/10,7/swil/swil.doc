SUMMARY


1.0  SUMMARY

SWIL (SCAN-WILD-I/O-Library) is a program library  which  functionally
supersedes  the  traditional SCAN and WILD subroutines.  SWIL provides
not only command parsing (SCAN)  and  wildcarded  file  search  (WILD)
operations but also file manipulation and I/O functions as well.

SWIL version 13 runs under all supported TOPS10 monitors, and has been
tested  under  7.02  and  7.03.   SWIL version 13 fully supersedes all
previous versions.

SWIL version 13 contains necessary support code for the  FAL  program,
in  particular,  for  GALAXY  version 5 and related accounting system.
Additionally, version 13 contains assorted bug fixes.

There is no documentation for SWIL, it's all done by magic.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  SWIL Format Change

SWIL  version  13  incorporates  several  "minor   version"   changes.
Therefore, all programs which use SWIL must be recompiled with the new
SWIL.UNV before they can use the new SWIL.REL.



2.2  GALAXY Release 5, ACTDAE Version 2

SWIL version 13 implements the  ACTDAE  version  2  accounting  system
interface (QUEUE.  monitor call) as required by FAL version 2.



2.3  FAL Version 2

SWIL version 13 contains support code for FAL version 2 as  needed  to
provide  "multi-threaded"  network  file  access  capability, for both
ANF-10 and DECnet-10.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

SWIL version 12A is known not to work effectively with ULTRIX  systems
due to the ULTRIX file specifications.

SWIL version 12A has not been tested against  either  CP/M  or  MS-DOS
systems.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

4.1  SWIL Contents And Description

SWIL (SCAN-WILD-I/O-Library) consists of the following source files:

     1.  SWIL.MAC       Universal definitions for SWIL

     2.  SWIFIL.MAC     File access and manipulation routines

     3.  SWIWLD.MAC     Local-file-system   wildcard    file    access
         routines

     4.  SWILIO.MAC     General I/O subroutines

     5.  SWINET.MAC     Network  routines;   DAP  support;   ANF   and
         DECnet "drivers"

     6.  SWISCN.MAC     Command  parsing,  general   character   input
         routines

     7.  SWIHLP.MAC     HELP command/switch processor

     8.  SWIQUE.MAC     QUEUE.  UUO GALAXY interface routines

     9.  SWIERM.MAC     Error message printout routines

    10.  SWITOU.MAC     General-purpose typeout subroutines

    11.  SWIMEM.MAC     General-purpose memory-management routines

    12.  SWIMSC.MAC     Miscellaneous subroutines of general interest




4.2  SWIL Assembly

The SWIL components should be assembled in  the  order  listed  above.
The indirect command file SWIL.CMD may be used for this purpose.

After assembly, SWIL.UNV should be moved to  the  system  REL:   area.
The  various  SWI???.REL  files should be concatenated into the master
library file SWIL.REL, again  in  the  order  as  listed  above.   The
PIP-style  indirect  command  file  SWIL.CCL  may  be  used  for this.
SWIL.REL should then be moved to  the  system  REL:   area.   At  this
point, the SWIDEF.UNV and various SWI???.REL files may be discarded.

The SWIL.CTL batch  control  file  will  perform  the  above  assembly
operations, and will build the SWIL.REL library file.
