QUOLST.DOC -- Changes from V4(36) to V5(42)
June 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 5 represents a number of enhancements:

     1.  The passive search list has been added.
     2.  The "(SYS)" field is always printed.
     3.  Logical assignments are ignored.
     4.  The program has been made shareable.
     5.  Converted to UUOSYM symbols.

This version supersedes all previous versions and runs on all 6-series
monitors.

See also QUOLST.HLP.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  Previously, QUOLST only typed the active search  list.   This
         version  however,  will  print  both  the  active and passive
         search  lists.   The  two  lists  are  separated  by   typing
         "--FENCE--".
     2.  The number of blocks left on the structure is always printed,
         even  if  the  other  fields  are omitted.  E.G., if the user
         doesn't have a UFD on the structure,  QUOLST  will  skip  the
         typing  of  his  quota.  It will, however, type the number of
         free blocks left on the system.
     3.  Only physical structure names are used.  Logical  assignments
         are ignored.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

     1.  The program has been made shareable.
     2.  The source file has been converted to  UUOSYM  symbols.   The
         major symbols affected are EXL???AND .CH???  .

5.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install the distributed file QUOLST.EXE on SYS:.  This file  needs  no
changes to be useable on all systems.

QUOLST.DOC -- Changes from V3 to V4(36)
MARCH 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 4 represents a complete reformatting  of  the  QUOLST  output.
This  change  was made to speed up the typing and to eliminate several
items of confusion.  Although the result is quite terse,  it  is  much
more  understandable.   A help file is supplied which explains the use
of QUOLST.

This version supersedes all previous versions and runs on all 5-series
monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The output has been compacted with a single title line and the numbers
arranged  in  columns.   The  columns  are  right adjusted for ease of
reading.  The reserved quota is not listed since it is not implemented
in  te system.  New columns of used, free FCFS and free logged out are
given since the user usually wants to know how close to his  quota  he
is  rather than the quota itself.  When the quotas are infinite or the
monitor tables are guaranteed meaningless, (e.g., [1,2]),  the  output
is  blank  rather than huge numbers.  The system space is displayed on
the same line with the  user's  information.   The  system  space  for
structures  which  are  not in the user's list are omitted.  These are
available by running SYSTAT/F.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICENCIES

None.



4.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The only other internal change is that the gettab value of MFD PPN  is
used rather than [1,1].



5.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install the distributed file QUOLST.HLP on SYS:.  This file  needs  no
changes to be useable on all systems.
