1.0  SUMMARY

The NETWORK program lists the nodes in an ANF10 or DECnet network,  as
well  as  the  known  LAT servers on an ethernet.  The ANF10 nodes are
listed in a format similar to the TOPS-10 NODE command.  The nodes  in
a  DECnet  network  are  in a format similar to the TOPS-20 "I DECNET"
command.  In addition to this basic function the NETWORK program  also
allows  the  user  to  select  the  nodes  to  be  displayed by use of
wildcarded        node        names,         device         attributes
(TTY,LPT,CDR,RDA,CDP,PTP,MTA,PTR,MCR),  or the ability of a node to be
a host.  The NETWORK program can also list topology information,  link
costs,  and  delays.   The  output  can also be sorted by node name or
number.  The output of the program can be controlled  by  switches  to
produce  a  desired amount of verbosity.  Error messages are given for
specified nodes that  are  not  found  in  either  network.   Indirect
command file and SWITCH.ini support are included.

Version 3 of the NETWORK program supercedes version 2 of  the  NETWORK
program.

The NETWORK program  will  run  on  version  7.01  and  later  TOPS-10
monitors  (however  it should be noted that DECnet information is only
available on 7.02 and later monitors,  and  LAT  information  is  only
available on 7.03 and later monitors).



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

External changes fall into two categories:   functions  and  switches.
First the functional changes:

     1.  LAT terminal server information is available for typeout.

Next the new switches.

     1.  The /LAT switch has been added to control the listing of  LAT
         terminal  servers.   The  default  case  is  to  NOT list LAT
         information.  The LAT typeout is not sorted.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None at this time.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In addition to the file NETWORK.MAC the  files  SCAN.REL,  HELPER.REL,
SCNMAC.UNV,  MACTEN.UNV,  and  UUOSYM.MAC are needed.  NETWOR requires
SCNMAC version 7(106) (or later) which is included with this tape.  To
compile and load NETWORK type:

     LOAD REL:SCAN,REL:HELPER,DSK:NETWORK<carrage return>

Then type:

     SSAVE NETWORK<carrage return>

Doing this will give a sharable copy  of  NETWORK.EXE.   5.0  INTERNAL
