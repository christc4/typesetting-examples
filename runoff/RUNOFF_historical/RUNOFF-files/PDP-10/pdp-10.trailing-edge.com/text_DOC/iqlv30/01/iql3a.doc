1.0  SUMMARY

IQL is a joint product of Digital Equipment Corporation and AZREX, INC.


IQL Version 3A is a maintenance  release  of  IQL  Version  3.   Several
outstanding  bugs  are corrected in this release, and some new DBMS FIND
record selection expressions are supported.

IQL3A runs under release 3 and 3A of TOPS-20 and under release  6.03  or
later of TOPS-10.  It has been tested in-house under 3A and 7.01.

IQL3A has been compiled and tested with COBOL/LIBOL V12.  It  will  also
work  with V12A, but will have to be recompiled.  See IQL3A.BWR for more
details.  IQL3A also requires SORT V4 for TOPS-20 or SORT V3A or  4  for
TOPS-10.  It is loaded with LINK V3A or higher.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Functional Changes

     1.  IQSCH now works correctly.  The R  (Replace)  update  code  now
         works   correctly.    There   are   some   differences  in  the
         dictionaries generated by IQSCH V3 and V3A, which are described
         in detail in the .BWR file.

     2.  IQL3A will accept  lower-case  commands  and  convert  them  to
         upper-case.   There  are  some  other considerations concerning
         upper and lower case which are described in the .BWR file.

     3.  Most IQL modules are now loaded to use the  sharable  reentrant
         LIBOL  (LIBO12.EXE).   See  the .BWR file for details on how to
         build IQL completely using reentrant LIBOL.

     4.  FIND statements which result in  a  FIND  of  the  SYSTEM  DBMS
         record  now  work correctly.  It is no longer necessary to do a
         FIND rse 3 before doing a FIND rse 1 or FIND rse 5.

     5.  The extension of saved queried has been changed  from  .QRY  to
         .INQ   to   avoid   conflict  with  TOPS-20  EDIT  backup  file
         extensions.  It will be necessary  to  rename  *.QRY  to  *.INQ
         under both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

     6.  IQL3A uses a universal password to protect access to changes in
         any  dictionaries which include passwords ton data items.  This
         password will also allow access to any data item  protected  by
         any  password.   The  distributed  password  can  be changed by
         changing  the  value  of   the   working-storage   item   named
         UNIVERSAL-PASSWORD  in  COBOL  modules  IQA, IQD, IQL, and IQU.
         For convenience, it is positioned as the first data item in the
         WORKING-STORAGE SECTION of these programs.

2.2  Functional Additions

     1.  Most of the DBMS FIND  rse's  now  work.   See  .BWR  for  more
         details.

     2.  DBMS records may  now  have  any  SCHEMA-allowable  mixture  of
         COMPUTATIONAL,  DISPLAY-6, and DISPLAY-7 item types (mixing all
         three in the same record is not allowed in DBMS).

     3.  There are several new pre-defined item names pertaining to DBMS
         usage.  They are:

         1.  ERROR-COUNT -- a numeric item which is  set  to  0  if  the
             just-completed  DBMS FIND/GET was successful, and is set to
             non-0 if an error occurred.

         2.  ERROR-STATUS -- a numeric item which is set  to  the  error
             status  retuned  by DBMS in case of errors, and is set to 0
             if no error occurred.

         3.  RECORD-NAME -- an alpha item which returns the ASCII record
             name of the last record successfully found/gotten.

         4.  AREA-NAME -- an alpha item which  returns  the  ASCII  area
             name of the last record successfully found/gotten.

         5.  CURRENT-RECORD-KEY -- a  numeric  item  which  returns  the
             encoded  data  base  key  of  the  last record successfully
             found/gotten.

         6.  AREA-ID -- an alpha item which is set by the programmer  to
             to the ASCII area name of records which are to be found via
             rse 5.  This is the only instance where it should be used.


     4.  The REWRITE verb now works correctly when used in  a  query  to
         replace   an   existing  ISAM  record.   Caution,  however,  is
         recommended when using this verb that your data  files  are  in
         fact being correctly updated.

     5.  A panic interrupt feature is available to  TOPS-20  IQL  users.
         See file SETINT.MEM for more details.
