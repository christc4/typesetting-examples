JOB STEP AND FILE NAMING


                  JOB STEP AND FILE NAMING



DEC Data Center has used a deFacto standard in naming job steps  and
files  produced  by  those  steps.   A  slight  modification of that
standard will ease record keeping for the Production  Control  group
of DEC Data Center.



JOB STEP NAMING

All job steps in the initial implementation of a system will  be  in
increments  of  10.   For  example, a five-step Accounts Payable job
would be designated AP 1-10, AP 1-20,...AP 1-50.   The  maximum  job
step  number  is  999, or in the above example AP 1-999.  Subsequent
job step additions would then be inserted between.  For example,  AP
1-5, AP 1-7.



FILE NAMING

File names, except for table files, will reflect  the  System,  Job,
Step,  Sequence Number and Type of file.  A filename is comprised of
a six-character filename and a three-character extension; Using  the
general character positions

          123456.789

The following information should be embedded:

1-2  Two-character system name.

3-4  Two-digit job number, zero fill.

5-7  Three-digit step number, zero fill.

 8   Alphabetic sequence character to force  a  uniqueness  in  file
     names from same job step.

 9   Alphabetic character indicating type of file:

               C = Collection file
               E = Error file
               M = Master file
               P = Print file
               T = Transaction file

The Accounts Payable example above having job  step  AP  1-10  might
procude a print file with the name of AP0101.0AP.

blocks:

     INITIALIZE BLOCK

     Branch to this step.
     EYEBALL asterisk lines.
     SYSTEM/JOB/STEP/FUNCTION information.
     Step Label and Checkpointing the restart step.

MPB STEP OVERVIEW


     NORMAL STEP WRAP-UP BLOCK

     Delete all unnecessary files.
     Unload MTA's and dismount special structures.
     Deassign all structures.
     PLEASE message to operator if file was queued.
     Branch to step end label.



     ERROR-HANDLING BLOCK

     %ERR and %CERR labels branching to error label for that step.
     Delete all unnecessary files.
     Unload or Dismount MTA's and special structures.
     Deassign all other structures.
     PLEASE message to operator indicating error and branch point.
     Branch to "ENDBD" label, or next appropriete step label.

GENERAL MPB STANDARDS


                   GENERAL MPB STANDARDS

 1.  All job streams will have as the first two executable commands

               a.  the appropriate 'PLEASE' command
               b.  a GOTO command to the first step.

 2.  Every stream label will have up to five characters followed  by
     two  colons, space and the appropriate checkpoint command.  The
     following labels are standard in the indicated uses:

          LABEL                        FUNCTION
          -----                        --------

          STxxx           First executable line in step xxx.

          GDxxx           Step end label for step xxx.

          BDxxx           Error handling block for step xxx.

          ENDGD           Successful completion of Job Stream.  

          ENDBD           Unsuccessful completion of Job Stream.

     For example, a step label when the step  is  restartable  would
     be:

               ST010:: .CHKPNT ST010

     If a step were not restartable as in an  in-place  update,  the
     checkpoint should be for a file reload:

               ST020:: .CHKPNT ST010

     or for an error end to the stream for operator attention:

               ST020:: .CHKPNT ENDBD

 3.  All PLEASE messages must be either from the  standard  list  or
     accepted by the supervisor of computer operations.

 4.  Any files created in the call deck via CDRSTK must be  assigned
     to device DSK:.

 5.  All assign and mount commands must include as ";" comments  the
     following:

               type (input, output, I/O)
               job/step creating file
               file label
               short description

DEC DATA CENTER MPB STANDARDS    APRIL 12, 1973     PAGE   8
GENERAL MPB STANDARDS


     For example:

     .ASSIGN DSKW:DSK1   ;INPUT AR 1-10 (AR0101.0DT)
                         ;INPUT TRANSACTIONS

     .MOUNT MTA:MTAA/VID:'AR 1-20;AR0102.0AM;OUTPUT'
                         ;UPDATED MASTER FILE

     .ASSIGN DSKW:SRT1   ;SORT WORK FILE

     .MOUNT DSKP:DSK0    ;INPUT EM 2-140 (EM0114.0AM)
                         ;EMPLOYEE MASTER FILE

 7.  Logical disk names will have a numeric identifier; for example,
     DSK1, DSK012.

 8.  Logical magtape names will have an alphabetic  identifier;  for
     example, MTAA, MTAX.

 9.  All production programs and overlays will be run  from  DSKLIB:
     [11,1].

10.  All 'RUN' commands will be preceded by

               .OPERATOR $

     where  $  represents  a  dollar  sign.   The  first  executable
     statement after a .RUN will be 

               .NOOPERATOR.

11.  TTY responses  to  programs  will  include  a  comment  in  the
     preceding  line  indicating what the system program asked.  For
     example

               ;ENTER ALPHA FISCAL MONTH
               *DECEMBER

12.  All monitor level commands will have a period '.' in column  1.
     All program responses will have an asterisk '*' in column 1.

13.  All monitor  commands  must  be  completely  spelled  out.   No
     abbreviations can be used.

14.  All print spooler requests  must  have  /DISPOSE:RENAME  unless
     conditions dictate otherwise.

15.  All magtape will be "unloaded" via .UNLOAD in  both  the  error
     handling block and the NORMAL STEP WRAP-UP BLOCK.

16.  ".FINISH" will be used to deassign all devices at  the  end  of
     each step.

GENERAL MPB STANDARDS


17.  Each stream step will be self-contained in that  it  will  have
     all the assignments necessary to execute the program(s) in that
     step, and all deassign and deletes needed for that step.

18.  Each MPB step will be numbered for the  job  step  that  it  is
     executing.   For  example  AR 1-10 will have steps ST010, BD010
     and GD010.

19.  Non-standard devices shall be  assigned  and  deassigned  using
     "MOUNT"  and  "DISMOUNT".  Examples of non-standard devices are
     DECtape drives and disk packs that  are  not  normally  present
     during production hours.

20.  No run-time files will be located on SYS:.  Tables and  similar
     files will be maintained on 11,1 with a protection of <111>.

21.  All program responses imbedded in the MPB streams which must be
     changed  with  each  run  must  be  figurative  in the original
     stream.  For example, a date would  be  "mmddyy"  and  a  month
     would be "mmmmmmmmm" in the original stream.

22.  The "eyeball"  block  for  each  module  can  contain  comments
     regarding special considerations for that module.

23.  Updates to existing MPB streams must be made to a copy  of  the
     stream which resides in the production library.

STANDARD 'PLEASE' COMMANDS


                 STANDARD 'PLEASE' COMMANDS



The following list of  'PLEASE'  commands  are  to  be  used
exactly  as represented.  If any batch stream conditions are
encountered which require other command strings, please  see
the  supervisor  of  Computer  Operations for an appropriate
addition to this list.  A command must appear on one line of
67  characters.   (Some examples below have two lines due to
margin constraints of this document).



.PLEASE-AR 20 * CONFIG:DSKW:5K,DSKT:20K,DSKE:1K,MTA:2

.PLEASE-AR 20 * STARTING.$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * (0999AR) STARTING ***RESTARTABLE***$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * (0999AR) STARTING ***NOT RESTARTABLE***$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * MOUNT AR 19-12(AR1912.OAT) ON ANY MTA.

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * MOUNT SCRATCH  FOR  AR  20-20(AR2020.OAT)
     ON ANY MTA.

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 *  AR2010.PRT Q'ED.$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * FAILED-CHECK LOG!  GOING TO ENDBD$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * FAILED-CHECK LOG!  GOING BACK TO AR
     20-10$

.PLEASE-AR 20-10 * FAILED-CHECK LOG!  GOING AHEAD TO
     AR 20-20$

.PLEASE-AR 20 * JOB STREAM HAS FINISHED.$



The DEC Data Center  organization  and  the  design  of  MPB
Stream Standards are aimed at minimizing interaction between
the application program  and  the  computer  operator.   One
activity  that  must  remain in that realm is when a program
reads or writes more than one file from a  tape  drive.   In
that  case,  the  following  COBOL code or its equivalent in
other languages should be used:

DISPLAY "$-AR 20-10 * MOUNT AR 20-10(AR2010.0AT) ON DEVICE (CONT) 
STOP  "$-AR 20-10 * MTAXXX IN PLACE OF AR 20-200(AR2020.0AT)".
