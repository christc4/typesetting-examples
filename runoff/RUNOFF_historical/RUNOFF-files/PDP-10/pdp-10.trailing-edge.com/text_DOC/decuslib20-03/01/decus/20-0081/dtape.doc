CONCEPTS:

A.  VOLUME NUMBER (VOL=)

    EACH TAPE CARRIES A VOLUME NUMBER (PHYSICAL TAPE NUMBER)
    WHICH UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES EACH REEL OF TAPE IN THE LIBRARY.

    THIS NUMBER APPEARS ON BOTH THE REEL-FACE AND THE 
    TAPE-SEAL OR CANISTER.

    THE VOLUME NUMBER IS A POSITIVE NUMBER OF UP TO 4 DIGITS.

    VOLUME NUMBERS ARE ASSIGNED TO THE REELS BY THE USER WHEN
    NEW TAPES ARE ADDED TO THE LIBRARY AND REMAIN WITH THE TAPES
    REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY ARE USED.

    OCCASIONALLY A BAD TAPE WILL BE DISCARDED OR REPLACED.
    IF A TAPE IS DISCARDED,ITS VOLUME NUMBER MUST BE DELETED
    FROM THE SYSTEM. IF A TAPE IS REPLACED, THE OLD TAPE IS DE-LABELED
    AND DISCARDED, AND THE NEW TAPE IS GIVEN THE OLD VOLUME NUMBER.

    TAPE STORAGE MUST BE ORGANIZED BY VOLUME NUMBER.

    WHENEVER TAPES ARE MOUNTED, THEY ARE CALLED FOR BY VOLUME
    NUMBER ONLY. MULTI-REEL FILES APPEAR AS A STRING OF VOLUME
    NUMBERS SEPARATED BY HYPHENS IN THE VID PORTION OF THE MOUNT
    MESSAGE.

B.  VISUAL IDENTIFICATION (VID=)

    IN ADDITION TO THE VOLUME-LABELS ON EACH TAPE, EVERY
    NON-SCRATCH TAPE CARRIES A VID-LABEL SPECIFYING THE GENERATION-GROUP
    OF WHICH IT IS A MEMBER. THIS LABEL MAY ALSO PROVIDE OTHER
    INSTALLATION DEFINED DATA SUCH AS REEL-OF,CREATION DATE,
    CREATION TIME, DEVICE, ETC.

    THE VID IS A 6 CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC FIELD.

    DTAPE CATALOGS EVERY TAPE UNDER ITS APPROPRIATE VID. SCRATCH
    TAPES ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR SPECIAL VID'S (0300FT,
    0600FT, 1200FT, 2400FT) ACCORDING TO SIZE.

    WITHIN A VID, TAPES ARE CATALOGED ACCORDING TO GENERATION-LEVEL;
    AND WITHIN GENERATION-LEVEL, REEL-NUMBER OF THE FILE. 
    REEL-NUMBER IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH VOLUME-NUMBER;
    THE FIRST REEL OF A FILE IS REEL-NUMBER 1, ETC.

C.  GENERATION LEVEL (GEN=)

    EACH GENERATION OF A GIVEN VID IS ASSIGNED A NUMERIC GENERATION
    LEVEL ACCORDING TO THE RELATIVE AGE OF THE GENERATION.

    GENERATION LEVELS ARE EXPRESSED AS NEGATIVE VALUES HAVING
    THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

    GENERATION LEVEL           MEANING
         -1                 MOST RECENTLY CREATED
         -2             2ND MOST RECENTLY CREATED
         -3             3RD MOST RECENTLY CREATED
          .                       .
          .                       .

    SINCE GENERATION LEVELS ARE NEGATIVE, THIS DOCUMENT ASSUMES
    THE CONVENTION THAT -2 IS "BELOW" -1, -3 IS "ABOVE" -5, ETC.

    GENERATION LEVELS ARE ALWAYS CONTIGUOUSLY OCCUPIED, BEGINING
    WITH -1 AND GOING DOWN THROUGH THE NUMBER OF EXISTING
    GENERATIONS.

D.  GENERATION COUNT (GEN=)

    EACH TIME A GENERATION IS CREATED (MOUNTED FOR OUTPUT)
    A GENERATION COUNT FOR THAT VID IS INCREMENTED AND ASSIGNED
    TO THAT GENERATION. THE GENERATION COUNT IS A POSITIVE
    NUMBER HAVING THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

    GENERATION COUNT           MEANING
          1               1ST GENERATION CREATED
          2               2ND GENERATION CREATED
          3               3RD GENERATION CREATED
          .                       .
          .                       .

    DTAPE WILL RESET THE GENERATION COUNT TO 1 WITH THE NEXT
    CREATION AFTER 9999.

    DTAPE DISPLAYS THE GENERATION LEVEL AND COUNT IN THE FORMAT
    -L(C) WHERE  "L" IS THE LEVEL AND "C" IS THE COUNT.

E.  RETENTION CODE (RCD=)

    EACH VID HAS A RETENTION CODE FOR DETERMINING WHAT
    RETENTION DATE TO GIVE EACH NEW GENERATION. IT IS
    A NUMERIC FIELD WHOSE VALUES HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

    RETENTION CODE             MEANING
      -<INTEGER>           KEEP <INTEGER> GENERATIONS
             0             ILLEGAL VALUE
        YYMMDD             KEEP UNTIL AFTER THIS DATE
        YY0000             KEEP YY YEARS
        00MM00             KEEP MM MONTHS
        0000DD             KEEP DD DAYS

F.  RETENTION DATE (RDT=)

    EACH GENERATION MOUNTED FOR OUTPUT IS GIVEN A RETENTION
    DATE AS FOLLOWS:

    1.  IF THE RETENTION CODE IS NEGATIVE, 999999 IS ASSIGNED.

    2.  IF THE RETENTION CODE IS POSITIVE, A RETENTION DATE
        IS CALCULATED.

    THE "SCRATCH EXPIRED" COMMAND WILL RETURN TO THE APPROPRIATE
    SCRATCH VID, TAPES IN GENERATIONS:

    1.  HAVING RETENTION DATES LESS THAN TODAY'S DATE OR

    2.  AT GENERATION LEVELS BELOW THAT SPECIFIED BY A 
        NEGATIVE RETENTION CODE.


USING DTAPE:

A.  GENERAL

    WHEN DTAPE REQUIRES CONTROL INFORMATION, IT DISPLAYS
    "XXX=" WHERE XXX IS A MNEMONIC CODE INDICATING WHAT IS
    REQUIRED.  THE FIRST MNEMONIC IS "CMD=" WHICH MEANS A
    COMMAND IS REQUIRED.  AFTER ACCEPTING THE COMMAND, DTAPE
    SIMILARLY ACCEPTS ALL PARAMETERS REQUIRED BY THE SPECIFIED
    COMMAND.  IT THEN PERFORMS THE COMMAND, DISPLAYS "CMD="
    AND WAITS FOR THE NEXT COMMAND.

    THE ALTMODE, INSTEAD OF THE CR, MAY BE USED TO TERMINATE
    INPUTS SO THAT COMMAND DATA WILL BE STRUNG OUT HORIZONTALLY.

    ONLY THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS OF A COMMAND ARE REQUIRED.

    THE "EXIT" COMMAND MAY BE USED TO RETURN CONTROL
    TO THE MONITOR.

    USERS SHOULD NEVER-NEVER-NEVER DO A ^C EXIT EXCEPT WHEN
    DTAPE IS REQUESTING A COMMAND (CMD=) OR A PARAMETER (E.G. GEN=).
    A ^C AT OTHER TIMES MAY LEAVE THE DTAPE FILES BOTCHED UP. TO KEEP
    THIS KIND OF PROBLEM UNDER CONTROL, ALL COMMANDS WHICH UPDATE
    THE DTAPE FILES SET A FLAG ASSOCIATED WITH THE VID BEING AFFECTED.
    THE FLAG IS SET AFTER ALL NECESSARY PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN ENTERED AND
    CLEARED WHEN THE COMMAND HAS BEEN COMPLETELY EXECUTED. IF THE
    SYSTEM CRASHES (OR A ^C^C IS ENTERED) BEFORE THE COMMAND IS
    COMPLETED, THE VID AFFECTED REMAINS FLAGGED.
    ANY FURTHER UPDATE-TYPE COMMANDS AGAINST THAT VID WILL BE LOCKED
    OUT PRODUCING  THE ERROR MESSAGE:

        "?LAST <CMD> COMMAND INCOMPLETE ON VID <VID>"

    TO CLEAR THIS FLAG, TYPE THE VID IN QUESTION ON THE TTY.
    AS DTAPE TYPES THE VID IT WILL CHECK FOR ANY INCONSISTENCIES
    IN THE FILES. IF THE FLAG WAS SET AND THE FILES ARE OK,
    IT WILL CLEAR THE FLAG AUTOMATICALLY. HOWEVER IF THE FILES
    ARE BOTCHED UP, THE VID WILL REMAIN LOCKED UP, MAKING IT NECESSARY TO
    RELOAD THE DTAPE FILES (DTAPE.VOL, DTAPE.VID, DTAPE.IDX)
    FROM THE LATEST FAILSAFE TAPE.

B.  COMMANDS

    ADD - ADDS NEW VOLUMES TO THE SCRATCH VID'S OR NEW VID'S
          TO THE SYSTEM.

        TO ADD NEW VOLUMES TO A SCRATCH VID:

        .RUN DTAPE

        CMD=ADD
        WHT=SCRATCH
        SIZ=1200FT

        VOL=786 *
        VOL=787 *
        VOL=790
        ? 790 ALREADY EXISTS
        VOL=791 *
        VOL=^C

       *  NEW 1200 FOOT TAPES MUST NOW BE VOLUME-LABELED
          AND PLACED IN THE TAPE LIBRARY.

         MRS=0600FT       MIN-REEL-SIZE WHEN MOUNTING SCRATCHES

    CHANGE - CHANGES VOLUME NUMBERS, VID'S, RETENTION CODES,
             RETENTION DATES AND RPG'S.

        TO CHANGE VOLUME 278 TO 591 LEAVING 278 AN UNUSED NUMBER:

        .RUN DTAPE

        CMD=CHANGE
        WHT=VOLUME
        VOL=278
        NEW=591

             REEL 278 MUST NOW BE VOLUME-LABELED 591 AND PLACED
             IN LOCATION 591 IN THE TAPE LIBRARY

        TO CHANGE VID GS1075 TO GS10:

        CMD=CHANGE
        WHT=VID
        VID=GS1075
        NEW=GS10

        TO CHANGE THE RETENTION CODE FOR GS10 SO TAPES
        WILL BE KEPT 90 DAYS:

        CMD=CHANGE
        WHT=RCD
        VID=GS10
        NEW=000090

        BE SELECTED WHEN A MOUNT CALLS FOR A SCRATCH:

        CMD=CHANGE
        WHT=RPG
        VID=GS10
        NEW=3

        TO CHANGE MIN-REEL-SIZE FOR GS10 SO DTAPE WILL
        BEGIN LOOKING IN THE 1200FT SCRATCH VID WHEN SCRATCH
        TAPE(S) IS (ARE) REQUIRED:

        CMD=CHANGE
        WHT=MRS
        VID=GS10
        NEW=1200FT

    DELETE - DELETES SCRATCH TAPES AND NULL VID'S FROM THE SYSTEM.

        TO DELETE SCRATCH TAPE 221 FROM THE SYSTEM:

        CMD=DELETE
        WHT=SCRATCH
        VOL=221

        TO DELETE GS10 FROM THE SYSTEM:

        ? GS20 NOT EMPTY
        CMD=DELETE
        WHT=VID
        VID=GS10

    ASSIGN - ASSIGNS REELS TO THE SPECIFIED VID AND GENERATION.
             IF THE GENERATION ALREADY HAS N REELS, THE NEW ONE
             BECOMES N+1.  IF NO SUCH GENERATION EXISTS, A NEW
             GENERATION IS CREATED BELOW THE LOWEST EXISTING
             GENDRATION.

        TO ASSIGN VOLUME 1235 TO GS10 LEVEL -2:

        CMD=ASSIGN
        WHT=VOLUME
        VOL=1235          MUST BE A SCRATCH TAPE
        VID=GS10
        GEN=-2

        TO ASSIGN A 1200 FOOT SCRATCH TO GS10 735TH GENERATION:

        CMD=ASSIGN
        WHT=SCRATCH
        SIZ=1200FT            VID OF THE 1200 FOOT SCRATCH POOL
        VID=GS10
        GEN=735

    SCRATCH - RETURNS THE SPECIFIED TAPES TO THE
              APPROPRIATE SCRATCH VID'S.

        TO SCRATCH THE LAST REEL FROM GD10 GENERATION LEVEL -3:

        CMD=SCRATCH
        WHT=REEL
        VID=GS10
        GEN=-3

        TO SCRATCH ALL EXPIRED GENERATIONS IN THE SYSTEM:

        CMD=SCRATCH
        WHT=EXPIRED     AS A PRECAUTION, THIS KIND OF SCRATCH
                        MUST BE PRECEEDED BY A TYPE-OUT OF ALL
                        EXPIRED TAPES

        WHENEVER TAPES ARE SCRATCHED, THEIR VID-LABELS MUST BE
        REMOVED.

    SWAP - SWAPS THE ASSIGNMENT OF ANY TWO VOLUMES IN THE SYSTEM.

        TO SWAP VOLUME 19 WITH 1573:

        CMD=SWAP

    REPORT - CREATES A REPORT FILE NAMED DTAPE.LPT
             SHOWING THE COMPLETE VOLUME STATUS
             AND VID STATUS OF THE SYSTEM:

    CATALOG - CATALOGS A SELECTED GENERATION OF A VID AT
              THE SPECIFIED GENERATION LEVEL.

        WHEN DTAPE CATALOGS A GENERATION, TWO PARAMETERS ARE 
        REQUIRED; THEY ARE GENERATION (GEN=) AND DISPOSITION (DIS=).
        THE GENERATION PARAMETER IS USED FOR FINDING THE GENERATION
        TO BE CATALOGED; AND THE DISPOSITION PARAMETER SPECIFIES THE
        LEVEL AT WHICH IT IS TO BE CATALOGED.  THE GENERATION
        PARAMETER MAY BE A GENERATION LEVEL OR COUNT.  THE DISPOSITION
        PARAMETER MUST BE ZERO OR A GENERATION LEVEL.

        WHEN THE DISPOSITION SPECIFIES AN OCCUPIED LEVEL, GENERATIONS
        AT THAT LEVEL AND BELOW ARE SHIFTED DOWN ONE LEVEL AND THE
        CATALOGED GENERATION IS INSERTED AT THE VACATED LEVEL.

        WHEN THE DISPOSITION SPECIFIES A GENERATION LEVEL BELOW
        THOSE OCCUPIED, THE CATALOGED GENERATION IS PLACED IMMEDIATELY
        BELOW THE LOWEST OCCUPIED LEVEL.

        "BEFORE" PLACING THE CATALOGED GENERATION AT ITS NEW LEVEL,
        ITS OLD LEVEL IS DELETED, CAUSING ALL GENERATIONS BELOW
        TO BE SHIFTED UP ONE LEVEL.  THE DISPOSITION PARAMETER
        IS THEN USED TO LOCATE THE NEW LEVEL.  THEREFORE, WHEN
        THE CATALOGING IS FINISHED, THE CATALOGED GENERATION
        WILL REMAIN AT THE LEVEL SPECIFIED BY THE DISPOSITION
        PARAMETER (UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT POINTS BELOW THE
        LOWEST OCCUPIED LEVEL).

        TO CATALOG GS10 -2 AT -4:

        CMD=CATALOG            BEFORE        AFTER

                              -3    103     -3    102

    MOUNT - PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:

            1.  CREATES A COMMAND FILE NAMED <LOGICAL DEV>.CMD
                FOR USE BY:
                A.  A SUBSEQUENT "MOUNT @<LOGICAL DEV>.CMD".
                B.  ANY PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES THE VOLUME NUMBER
                    IN ITS VALUE OF ID FOR LABEL CHECKING.

            2.  IF THE MOUNT IS FOR OUTPUT, THE CURRENT DATE IS
                IS RECORDED AS THE CREATION DATE AND THE CURRENT
                TIME IS RECORDED AS THE CREATION TIME. ALSO THE
                THE GENERATION COUNT FOR THAT VID IS INCREMENTED
                AND APPLIED TO THAT GENERATION.

            3.  CATALOGS THE "MOUNTED" GENERATION AT THE SPECIFIED
                LEVEL.  IF DIS=0, THE GENERATION IS LEFT AT ITS
                ORIGINAL POSITION; THIS ALLOWS ACCESSING THE N-TH
                GENERATION WITHOUT KNOWING ITS LEVEL AND WITHOUT
                DISTURBING IT.

            THE GENERATION COUNT IS IN REALITY
            A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF OUTPUT MOUNT COMMANDS PERFORMED
            ON A GIVEN VID BY DTAPE.

            IF THE GENERATION PARAMETER HAS A VALUE OF 0, SCRATCH
            TAPES WILL BE SELECTED AND ASSIGNED TO A NEW GENERATION.
            THE NEW GENERATION WILL BE CATALOGED AS SPECIFIED BY
            THE DISPOSITION PARAMETER. THE NUMBER OF TAPES SELECTED
            DEPENDS ON THE REELS-PER-GENERATION (RPG=) FOR THAT
            VID. DTAPE WILL LOOK FIRST IN THE SCRATCH VID
            SPECIFIED BY THE MIN-REEL-SIZE PARAMETER. IF THAT
            SCRATCH VID CANNOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT,
            DTAPE WILL LOOK IN THE NEXT SIZE LARGER SCRATCH VID,
            AND SO ON THRU 2400FT.

            WHEN SCRATCHES ARE MOUNTED FOR OUTPUT, IT IS THE
            OPERATOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LABEL THEM WITH VID-LABELS.

            SINCE THE VID PORTION OF THE MOUNT COMMAND FILE CONTAINS
            ONLY VOLUME NUMBERS, THE OPERATOR MUST BE INFORMED VIA
            THE "SEND" MONITOR COMMAND OF ANY INFORMATION REQUIRED
            ON THE NEW VID-LABEL.

        TO MOUNT THE 91ST GENERATION OF GS10 FOR INPUT
        ON LOGICAL DEVICE "MASTIN" AND KEEP IT AT ITS CURRENT
        LEVEL:
