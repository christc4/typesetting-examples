                                    INTRODUCTION
                                    ------------

      The RESUME program is a very simple word  processor  designed  specially
      for  the  production  of  resumes.  The use of the RESUME program by the
      students at the school enables the school to assemble  a  collection  of
      resumes  which all share a common format.  The students, however, retain
      all of the flexibility in the wording of their resumes and much  of  the
      flexibility  in  style that they would have if they were composing their
      resumes on a typewriter.

      The students use the RESUME program to type in  the  contents  of  their
      resumes,  and  then  to  check and to revise them.  Although the resumes
      could be  composed  while  the  students  are  using  the  program,  the
      students'  time  spent  on  the computer will be more effective if rough
      drafts of the resumes are composed before the students use  the  program
      the  first  time.  Each student can use the program many times to revise
      his or her resume until it is satisfactory to the  student.   Each  time
      that  the  program  is used, the resume belonging to the student running
      the program will be picked up as it was last left.   Each  student  must
      then  use  the  program  a  final time to submit the finished resume for
      inclusion in the collection being assembled by the school.

      The RESUME program is meant to be usable even by  students  who  do  not
      have  any  previous  computer experience.  The first time that a student
      runs the program, it will ask for the student's name  and  address,  and
      then  will  ask  for  the  student  to  add  to a standardized EDUCATION
      section.  Along the way, the student will  be  told  about  the  various
      conventions  which  the  program  expects, such as how to indicate blank
      lines and dates which are to appear along the left edge of the page.  If
      the  student  does  not  know  what  to  do at any point while using the
      program, the student can always get detailed  instructions  by  pressing
      the  ?  key without typing anything else before it, and then by pressing
      the RETURN key.

      The student's name will be the first thing that the program will ask for
      that will actually appear in the resume.  The name should be typed using
      all capital letters.  The RETURN key must be pressed after the name  has
      been  typed  in.   Likewise  the  RETURN  key  must be pressed after the
      student has typed any of the other things that  the  program  asks  for.
      When the program asks for the local address, only the words which are to
      appear on the first line of the address should be  typed.   The  program
      will  then  ask  for  the  contents  of  each the following lines of the
      address in turn.  The RETURN key must be pressed an extra time when  the
      address  has  been  completed.   The  program  will  finally ask for the
      student's phone number.  The program can also accept a permanent address
      and phone number.

      Each resume must fit onto a single page.  The  student's  name,  address
      and  phone number will appear at the top of the resume.  If both a local
      address and a  permanent  address  are  specified,  then  the  permanent
      address  will appear to the right of the local address.  The resume will
      be divided into sections with lines being ruled between these  sections.
      The  descriptive text in the resume will start a couple of inches to the
      right of the left edge of the page so that section names and date ranges2                                             RESUME Program Users Guide


can  appear  along the left edge.  The name at the top of the resume and
the section names along the left edge will automatically appear in dark,
bold  lettering.  All other words which are to be darkened or underlined
will have to be specially marked.   It  is  suggested  that  school  and
company  names be entirely capitalized and darkened, and that employment
titles be underlined.

The initial contents of the first few lines  in  the  EDUCATION  section
will  be identical for every student in the class, although the students
can individually change the contents of these lines  later.   After  the
program  has  displayed the standard lines, the program will ask for any
additional information which is to appear in the EDUCATION section.  The
program  will  not  ask  for  any specific information for the EDUCATION
section or for any of the later sections.  It will be up to the  student
to  decide what information is to be included.  When everything which is
to appear in the EDUCATION section has been typed in, or if the  student
desires  to add to the EDUCATION section later rather than now, then the
RETURN key should be pressed an extra time to signal to the program that
the entry of this section is complete for the time being.

When the EDUCATION section has been finished, the program will ask "WHAT
NEXT?" A list of the many options which are available can be obtained by
pressing the ? key and then the RETURN key when this question is  asked.
These  options  are  selected  by  typing single English language words.
Among the options which are available, the word EDIT  can  be  typed  to
edit  individual  lines  in  the resume, the word APPEND can be typed to
append to a section, the word CREATE  can  be  typed  to  create  a  new
section,  the  word  DRAFT  can  be  typed  to display the resume as the
student typed it in and the word PROOF  can  be  typed  to  display  the
resume as it would appear when typed with the proper margins.  There are
many other options.  These are described in detail later in this  guide.
After  each of the operations which is requested by the student has been
completed, the program will again ask the "WHAT NEXT?" question.

The word EXIT can be typed in response to the "WHAT NEXT?"  question  to
exit  from  the  program, saving the current version of the resume.  The
program can then be run  again  later  to  further  revise  the  resume.
Finally,  when  a  satisfactory version of the resume has been obtained,
the word SUBMIT  should  be  typed  in  response  to  the  "WHAT  NEXT?"
question.  This indicates that the resume is ready to be included in the
collection of resumes.  The resume cannot be changed after it  has  been
submitted.   If  the program is run after the resume has been submitted,
then the only function which it will perform is the production of a file
which  can  be  typed  or  printed  to  obtain a paper copy of the final
version of the resume.  The resume should not be submitted unless it has
been  checked carefully.  However, if a resume has been submitted but an
error is discovered in the resume before the deadline for the submission
of  all  of  the  resumes,  then the RESUME program administrator can be
asked to make the resume available for further  revisions.   The  resume
will have to be submitted again if this is done.

Only one terminal should be used at any one time to  edit  a  particular
resume.   If  a  single  resume is being edited simultaneously from more
than one terminal, then the version of the resume which is shown on  the
terminal which exits last will be the version which is saved.      List of the Major Commands                                             3

            WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE GOING TO THE COMPUTER
            ---- ------ -- ---- ------ ----- -- --- --------

The collections of resumes from previous classes should be consulted  to
learn  the  general  style  which is used by the students at the school.
The sample at the end  of  this  manual  is  meant  to  demonstrate  the
capabilities of the program and should not be used as a style guide.

In general, the resume is divided  into  sections,  one  for  education,
another  for  experience, and so on.  The student selects the labels for
these sections.  These labels will appear in bold lettering at the upper
left  corners  of the sections.  Lines are drawn across the width of the
resumes between the various sections.  Most of the  text  will  start  2
inches  in  from  the  left  edge  of  the  page.   Only dates and short
annotations can appear all the way to the left edge.

An initial draft of the resume should  be  prepared  before  the  RESUME
program is first used to enter the text of the resume into the computer.
The RESUME program has extensive editing and proofing capabilities,  but
making  extensive  changes after the text of the resume has been entered
into the computer is  tedious.   The  initial  draft  should  be  marked
according to the following rules to obtain a guide to what must actually
be typed into the computer in  order  to  obtain  the  desired  results.
These  rules are simple.  Margins, bolding and underlining are indicated
by inserting asterisks, circumflexes and underscores,  respectively,  at
the left ends of the words involved.

1.  Put an asterisk in each line which is to be blank in the resume.

2.  Put an asterisk to the right of a date or word or short phrase which
is  to  appear  at  the  left  edge of the resume.  There are exactly 20
columns between the left edge of the paper and  the  left  edge  of  the
descriptive text.

3.  Put an asterisk at the left end of each line  which  starts  with  a
word which must likewise start a new line in the resume.  If a line does
not start with an asterisk (or a minus sign as  described  below),  then
the  words  on  that  line can be moved to the right end of the previous
line to fill out the line.

4.  Put a minus sign at the left end of each line which  is  to  bear  a
bullet  in  the  resume.   If  a date is to appear to the left, then the
required order is date first, then  asterisk  followed  finally  by  the
minus sign.  Since the type style used does not include an actual bullet
character, the minus sign will appear in the  resulting  resume  at  the
start of the line.  The margin will be shifted 2 columns to the right.

5.  Put a circumflex (or up arrow or carat sign) before each word  which
is  to  be  darkened or bold in the resume.  If an asterisk or the minus
sign which indicates a bullet appears to the left of the word, then  the
circumflex  must appear between the asterisk or minus sign and the word.
The circumflex does not replace the space to the left of the  word.   If
the  word  being  darkened  is not the leftmost word on the line, then a
space must still appear between the preceding word and  the  circumflex.
The same word cannot be both darkened and underlined.      What Should be Done Before Going to the Computer                       5


      6.  Put an underscore (or left arrow) before each word which  is  to  be
      underlined  in  the  resume.   If  an  asterisk  or  a  minus sign which
      indicates a bullet appears to the left of the word, then the  underscore
      must  appear  between  the  asterisk  or  minus  sign and the word.  The
      underscore does not replace the space to the left of the word.   If  the
      word being underlined is not the leftmost word on the line, then a space
      must still appear between the preceding word and the underscore.

      7.  When the text is typed into the computer, discard leading spaces and
      all but 1 of adjacent spaces.

      For example, the initial draft might contain the following text.

      1970-1981   HEALTH DEPARTMENT Linden, New Jersey
                  Dog Catcher
                  Working in a department of 13 and 7/11ths people, I chased
                  stray dogs and enforced the "Clean up after your pet" law.
                  - In 1 day, I personally caught 2 beagles and 1 spaniel.
                  - Was responsible for an increase in the quality of life for
                    Linden's cats.

      1969        JAKE'S PIZZA Elizabeth, New Jersey
                  Cook
                  Part-time position.

      Marking the above text would produce the following guide to  what  would
      have to be typed into the computer to obtain the desired results.  It is
      assumed that firm names are darkened and job titles are underlined.

            HOW TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE RESUME PROGRAM AT SOM
            --- -- ---- ------ -- --- ------ ------- -- ---

The resumes will be produced using the DECsystem20  computer.   Students
who  do not already have accounts on the DECsystem20 will share a single
account with others in their own class.  This shared account should  not
be  used  for  any  purposes  other  than the production of the resumes.
Students who have individual accounts on the DECsystem20 can use  either
their  own  accounts  or  the shared account.  However, the same account
must be used to revise each resume as was  used  to  enter  the  initial
version of the resume.

The shared accounts will be named S.RESUME.XX where the  XX  stands  for
the  right  2  digits in the student's expected year of graduation.  The
password for this account will be the full 4 digit year  of  graduation.
A  student  in the class of 1985 would use the account named S.RESUME.85
and the password for this account would be 1985.

                 PASSWORDS USED TO RUN PROGRAM FROM SHARED ACCOUNTS
                 --------- ---- -- --- ------- ---- ------ --------

      The program will ask for a password if it is being run from  an  account
      which can be used by several students.  The password identifies which of
      the existing resumes can be modified by the student using the password.

      The passwords accepted by the program either  can  be  selected  by  the
      students  the  first  time  that the students run the program, or can be
      assigned to the students by the RESUME program administrator.  Currently
      the  students  select  their  own  passwords.  However, both schemes are
      described  here  because  the  passwords  might  be  assigned   by   the
      administrator during future interview seasons.

      If the passwords are being selected by  the  students  themselves,  then
      each  student  should  select  a  password which consists of a word or a
      short phrase which will not easily be guessed by anyone else who will be
      running the program.  The student will be asked to specify this password
      each time that the program is  used.   If  the  password  typed  by  the
      student  has  been used before, then the student will gain access to the
      corresponding resume and will be able to modify it.  If the password  is
      not  in  use, then a new resume will be started which can be modified in
      the future by the use of this password.  The password which is  selected
      by  the  student is not related to and does not depend upon the password
      which the student used to gain access to  the  account  from  which  the
      program is being run.

      The password must be formed from the alphabetic letters A through Z, the
      digits  0 through 9 and the spaces which appear between words.  No other
      characters are allowed.  The  word  or  phrase  can  contain  up  to  208                                             RESUME Program Users Guide


characters,  counting the separations between the words of a phrase as 1
character each.  The password "I AM THE BEST OF ALL"  would  be  of  the
maximum  length  and would be considered different than the passwords "I
AM THE BEST" or "I AM BEST OF ALL".

If the student has used the program before, and merely wants  to  review
or  modify the resume, then the student must type the word or the phrase
which was specified when the resume was  first  entered.   However,  the
cases  of  the alphabetic letters A through Z which were originally used
in specifying the word or phrase do not have  to  be  matched.   Capital
alphabetic  letters  can  be  typed  where small letters were originally
specified, and vice versa.  The student will have to contact the  RESUME
program administrator if the original password has been forgotten.

If the student has been assigned a number and an associated password  by
the  administrator,  then both the number and the password must be typed
to gain access to the program.  The program  will  ask  for  the  number
first.  The password can be typed to the right of the number on the same
line.  If the password is not typed on the same line, then  the  program
will  ask  for  the password to be typed on the next line.  The password
can by typed using either capital letters or small  letters.   Both  the
number  and  the password are needed to run the program.  Anyone who has
not been assigned a number and a password, or who has  forgotten  either
the  number  or  the password, will not be able to run the program.  The
student will have to contact the RESUME program administrator if  either
the number or password has been forgotten.


                ENTERING THE STUDENT'S NAME AND ADDRESS
                -------- --- --------- ---- --- -------

The student's name will be the first thing that the program will ask for
that  will  actually appear in the resume.  The name will appear in dark
letters at the top of the resume exactly as the student types  it.   All
of the letters in the name should be capitalized so that the name stands
out even more.  However, for a last name which consists of 2 words,  the
first  of  which  is a short prefix, or for a last name which is usually
typed with a capital letter in the middle of the name, the first word or
the  portion before the embedded capital letter should probably be typed
with small letters where these conventionally are used.  Gerry  McDonald
would  be  typed  GERRY  McDONALD with a small letter c.  The RETURN key
must be pressed after the name has been typed.  Likewise, the RETURN key
must be pressed after any of the other things that the program asks for.

The program will then ask for the student's address.  After this address
has  been completed, the program will ask whether a second address is to
be included.  If 2 addresses are specified, then the first should be the
student's  local  address,  and  the  second  should  be  the  student's
permanent address.  Most students  however,  just  specify  their  local
addresses  for use during the recruiting season.  The first address will
be lined up with the left edge of the paper  when  this  information  is
displayed on the terminal or printed using the NARROW format on the fast
printer.  However, this address will be shifted a couple inches  to  the
right  to  line  up  with  the  left edge of the descriptive text of the
resume when the final version of the resume is produced.  If 2 addresses      Entering the Student's Name and Address                                9


      are  supplied,  then  the second address will appear to the right of the
      first although the student will type it separately.

      Only the leading  letters  of  the  words  in  each  address  should  be
      capitalized.   If  the  ALPHA  LOCK  key  was pressed to get all capital
      letters in the name, then this key must be  pressed  a  second  time  to
      release  it  before  the address is typed.  The program will ask for the
      student to type each line of the address on a separate  line.   What  is
      typed  here  on a single line will remain separate from the other lines.
      The RETURN key must be pressed after each line is typed.  The RETURN key
      must  be  pressed  an  extra time after the last line of the address has
      been typed.  The program will then ask for  the  student's  local  phone
      number.   A second phone number can be included by typing it on the next
      line.  The RETURN key must be pressed an  extra  time  after  the  final
      phone  number  has  been  typed.   The program will then ask if a second
      address is to be included.  If the word YES is typed in response to this
      question,  then  the  program will ask for the lines of this address and
      for the phone number or phone numbers to be associated with it.

      Each section of the resume has a name by which it can  be  selected  for
      later  modification.   For most sections, these names also appear at the
      upper left corner of the section in the finished resume.  The  lines  of
      the  name  and addresses are stored in sections named NAME for the name,
      LOCAL for the local or main address and PERMANENT for the  permanent  or
      secondary  address.  These names are, however, invisible.  They will not
      appear in the finished resume.  The phone numbers are considered  to  be
      part  of  the addresses, although they are asked for separately.  If the
      student forgets to supply a phone number for  the  local  address,  then
      APPEND  LOCAL  can be typed in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" request, and
      the phone number can be typed on a line which is to be appended to  this
      section.   If a permanent address is not supplied when the addresses are
      asked for, but one is later wanted, a section  named  PERMANENT  can  be
      created  by  typing  CREATE  PERMANENT  in  response to the "WHAT NEXT?"
      question.  The text which is put  into  the  section  containing  either
      address  is  copied  into  the resume broken into lines exactly as these
      lines are typed in.  The NAME, LOCAL and PERMANENT sections do not  need
      to  be  located  before  the  other sections.  These sections are always
      sorted out and printed at the top of the resume.

      The following is a typical dialog between the program and a student  who
      is  entering  the  text which is to be in the name and address sections.
      The responses typed by the  student  are  shown  to  the  right  of  the
      question marks.  Where nothing appears to the right of the question mark
      which the program typed, the  student  merely  pressed  the  RETURN  key
      without having typed anything else before it.10                                            RESUME Program Users Guide

If the student later issues a DRAFT command in  response  to  the  "WHAT
NEXT?"  question,  then the name and address sections would be displayed
as shown below.  The "WHAT NEXT?" question  is  asked  after  the  name,
address  and  education  sections  have all been entered.  The student's
name has been placed in a section named NAME.   The  address  which  was
entered  first  has been placed in a section named LOCAL and the address
entered second into a section named PERMANENT.  These section names will
not  appear  in  the finished resume.  It is required that the student's
name and addresses appear in sections having these names.   The  program
recognizes  the  local address by looking for a section named LOCAL.  If
the local address appears in a section having any other  name,  then  it
cannot  be recognized as being the local address and will be included in
the body of the resume.  However, the names of these sections can either
be capitalized or be formed of small letters.

Since most terminals cannot directly show darkened letters, the  program
has  indicated which letters are to be darkened by pointing to them with
circumflex characters (the ^) in the next line.  The extra line used for
these circumflex characters will not appear in the final printed version
of the resume.  Also, this extra line will not be included in the length
of  the  resume  which  is calculated when a LENGTH command is issued in

                          COMPLETING THE EDUCATION SECTION
                          ---------- --- --------- -------

      When the student has finished entering his or her name and address, then
      the  program  will  ask the student to complete the EDUCATION section of
      the resume.  The first few lines in the EDUCATION section will  describe
      the  degree program in which the student is currently enrolled, and will
      be supplied automatically.  These lines will be the same for everyone in
      the  same  class.  The contents of these initial lines will be displayed
      and then the program will ask for the student to type in everything else
      which  is  to  be  in  the EDUCATION section.  If the information in the
      initial lines is incorrect, for example if a particular student is in  a
      joint  degree  program  or is expecting to graduate in a different year,
      then this information can be corrected later.  The  information  in  the
      initial  lines  cannot be corrected now.  If the contents of the initial
      lines are completely inappropriate, then the  student  should  start  by
      typing  in what they should contain.  The incorrect initial lines can be
      deleted later.

      The initial lines which are the same for all of the students in the same
      class  will  appear  similar  to  the  following  when  displayed by the
      program.

      The lines in the final resumes will be wider than can be  shown  on  the
      terminal  screen, so that fewer lines may be needed for this information
      in the finished  resume.   The  words  which  are  shown  underlined  by
      circumflexes  or  up  arrows will be darker in the final resume than the
      rest of the text.

      After displaying some additional information, the program will  place  a
      question  mark  at  the  left  edge  of  the screen to indicate that the
      program is ready to accept a line which  is  to  be  inserted  into  the
      EDUCATION  section.  The question mark and then the RETURN key should be
      pressed at this point to get a detailed description of the ways in which
      the format of the resume can be changed.  These instructions can also be
      obtained later whenever a new section is being created or whenever lines
      are  being appended to an existing section.  If anything other than just
      a question mark is typed before the RETURN key  is  pressed,  then  this
      information  will  be  appended  to  the EDUCATION section.  If only the
      RETURN key is pressed, then the program will ask if the current  section
      has  been  completed.   Additional  lines of text can be appended to the12                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


section later even if the  student  tells  the  program  that  yes,  the
section has been completed.

Provided that the standardized lines are  nearly  correct,  the  student
should  type  any additional information, such as a description of areas
of specialization, which is to be appended to  the  standardized  lines.
Then  any previous degrees should be described.  More recent educational
experience should be described first.  The lines which the student types
will  be  entered  into the resume in the order in which these lines are
typed.  These lines can be either short or long.  If  a  line  is  typed
which is longer than will fit onto a single line on the screen, then the
student should just keep on typing when the blinking cursor  returns  by
itself  to  the  left  edge  of the screen.  If the middle of a word was
being typed when the right edge of the screen was reached, then the rest
of  the  word should be typed.  If the last character in a word had just
been typed when the right edge of the screen was reached, then the space
bar  should be pressed before the next word just as it would if the word
had not extended to the right edge.

A phrase or a whole sentence or several sentences can  be  typed  before
the  RETURN  key is pressed.  Pressing the RETURN key indicates that the
line is finished, and that another will  be  typed  in.   It  does  not,
however, indicate that a new line is to begin at this particular spot in
the finished resume.  The words which are typed  in  will  be  collected
together  to  form lines of approximately uniform length in the finished
resume.  To start a new line in the finished resume, the  previous  line
must  be terminated by pressing the RETURN key and then an asterisk or a
star character (the *) must be typed at the  start  of  the  information
which  is  to  be  on  the  new line.  If something such as a date is to
appear to the left of the left margin, then the asterisk should  instead
be  inserted between the date and the rest of the text on the line.  The
asterisk, in effect, marks the position of the left margin.  If  a  line
does  not contain an asterisk, then the words on the line can be wrapped
around to fill out whatever was typed before the RETURN key was  pressed
to  end  the  previous time.  A completely blank line will appear in the
resume if a line typed by the student contains only an asterisk.

A circumflex or up arrow character (the ^) must be typed before each and
every  word  which is to be darkened in the resulting resume.  It is not
necessary to indicate that the student's name or the section  names  are
to  be  darkened.  An underscore or left arrow character (the _) must be
typed before each word which is to be  underlined.   It  is  recommended
that  school  names  and  company  names be both darkened and completely
capitalized.

A typical dialog between a student and the program in which  lines  were
added  to  the EDUCATION section is shown below.  The responses typed by
the student appear to the right of  the  question  marks  typed  by  the
program.   The  RETURN  key  was  pressed  an  extra  time at the end to
indicate that the section was complete.      Completing the Education Section                                      13

      A DRAFT command issued in response to the "WHAT  NEXT?"  question  would

      each would have its own line number.  These numbers are needed  by  many
      of  the  commands  which  can  be issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?"
      question to identify the particular line which is to be manipulated.

      A PROOF command issued in response to the "WHAT  NEXT?"  question  would
      display  the  resume  with the words of the text being wrapped around to
      form lines of approximately equal length, except where the appearance of
      an  asterisk would force a new line.  The number of characters which can
      be displayed across the width of the terminal is less than  will  appear
      in  each  line in the finished resume, so the division of the words into
      lines will vary.  The lines shown above would be displayed by the  PROOF
      command  as  shown  below.  However, in this manual most of the displays
      produced by the PROOF command have been squeezed further  to  fit  a  60

      than would actually be shown by the program.

      SPECIAL CONVENTIONS USED TO CONTROL THE FORMAT OF THE RESUME
      ------- ----------- ---- -- ------- --- ------ -- --- ------

In addition to the characters which would normally appear in  the  words
which  will  be  seen  by  the  reader  of  the  finished  resume, a few
characters are reserved for specifying the  appearance  of  the  resume.
These  characters  must  be  entered into the text of the resume and are
visible when the DRAFT, TYPE or EDIT commands are issued in response  to
the "WHAT NEXT?" question.  The results of the application of the format
changes indicated by these  characters  are  seen,  not  the  characters
themselves,  when  a  PROOF or a PAPER command is issued.  The following
characters are reserved for indicating the format of the resume.

  *  the asterisk or star character.

  _  the underscore or left arrow.  The underscore and  left  arrow  are
     different  markings  which identify the same character on different
     types of keyboards.

  ^  the circumflex or up arrow or carat sign.  The  circumflex  and  up
     arrow  are  different markings which identify the same character on
     different types of keyboards.

  -  the minus sign or hyphen.  This  is  only  treated  as  a  reserved
     character at the start of a line or following an asterisk.

The contexts in which the reserved characters can  be  used  are  listed
below along with short descriptions of the resulting formats.

*                     (a line containing only an  asterisk)  produces  a
                      completely blank line

      ^words ^in ^a ^phrase would darken (bold) the words in the phrase
      ^multi^national       would darken the prefix multi  but  not  the  word
                            national
      _words _in _a _phrase would underline the words in the phrase
      _multi_national       would underline the prefix multi but not the  word
                            national

      The words which are entered on consecutive lines are  usually  collected
      together  to  form lines of approximately uniform length in the finished
      resume.  A single asterisk appearing at the  start  or  within  a  line,
      however,  indicates that the words on that line do not continue those on
      the previous lines.  The asterisk marks the position of the left  margin
      which  is  located  about  2  inches  from  the  left  edge of the page.
      Whatever appears to the left of the asterisk will extend to the left  of
      the  left margin, and whatever appears to the right of the asterisk will
      be lined up with the left margin.

      An asterisk followed by a minus sign can  appear  at  the  start  of  or
      within  a  line  to  indicate  that whatever appears to the right of the
      minus sign is to start a new item in a list and is to be marked  at  its
      left  end  with  a bullet.  The bullet is represented by a hyphen in the
      finished resume if this is typed, or by a small filled-in circle if this
      is  typeset.   The left margin is shifted slightly to the right to allow
      the bullet to line up with the left edge of the rest of the text in  the
      resume.  The leading asterisk is not necessary if nothing other than the
      bullet is to extend out beyond  the  left  margin.   The  words  on  the
      following  lines  will  continue  to be accumulated into lines which are
      shifted slightly to the right and which are slightly shorter than normal
      until a subsequent line is found which starts with a minus sign or which
      contains an unpaired asterisk.

      For example, the following lines as displayed by the DRAFT command

       19 1978-79*Managed fast food stand
       20 in Vineyard Haven on Martha's Vineyard
       21 1980*-Had part-time job as clerk

would be converted into reformatted text similar  to  that  shown  below
when the PROOF command is issued.

1978-79 Managed fast food stand in Vineyard Haven on
        Martha's Vineyard
1980    - Had part-time job as clerk in hardware store in
          Woods Hole
        - Wrote novel which was eventually published by a
          major paperback publisher
        - Sang in barbershop quartet
        Returned to school at end of summer to continue work
        on BS in computer science

The first line in a section will start on the same line as  the  section
name unless this first line starts with or contains an asterisk.

Two minus signs can be inserted at the start of (or after  the  asterisk
in)  a line which is to be aligned with the items in a list but which is
not to bear a bullet.

Three minus signs can be inserted at the start of a line which is to  be
in an inner list and which is to bear a bullet.

Four minus signs can be inserted at the start of a line which is  to  be
aligned  with  the  items  in  an  inner list but which is not to bear a
bullet.

The name at the top of the resume and the section names which are  typed
at  the  upper  left  corners  of the sections will be typed darker than
normal.  To force any other word or  phrase  to  be  typed  darker  than
normal,  the  word  or  each  word  of  the  phrase can be preceded by a
circumflex or an up arrow character (the ^).  Similarly, to force a word
or  a phrase to be underlined when it is typed, the word or each word in
the phrase can be preceded with an underscore or  left  arrow  (the  _).
These  characters  should  be  obtained  by  using  the keys on the main
keyboard, not the leftward pointing arrow key  or  the  upward  pointing
arrow  key,  the  cursor keys, on the small keyboard to the right of the
main keyboard.   A  second  appearance  of  the  circumflex  or  of  the
underscore  can  appear within a word to cause the remainder of the word
to be typed in the normal fashion after the  preceding  portion  of  the
word   has   been   typed   either  darker  than  normal  or  underlined
respectively.  The same word cannot be both darkened and underlined.

As an example of the use of  these  special  characters,  the  following
lines of text in the resume

1975-1976*^Sixth ^Universal ^Bank New York, New York
*Promoted from _Janitor to _Vice _President

would cause the year range to appear at the left edge of the page, would
cause  the  bank name to be typed darker than normal and would underline
the position titles on the next line.      Special Conventions Used to Control Format of Resume                  17


      To right justify a phrase in a line which is to be typed on  the  letter
      quality  typewriter, 2 asterisks (**) would be inserted between the text
      which is to be flush with the left margin and the text which  is  to  be
      flush  with  the right margin.  The ** does not itself cause the line in
      which it appears to start a new line in the  finished  resume.   If  the
      line  containing  the  ** is to start a new line, then either a single *
      must appear somewhere to the left of the ** or a - must  appear  at  the
      start  of the line.  The ** also does not cause the next line to start a
      new line in the finished resume.  Instead, the words which can fit  onto
      the  line are assembled, then whatever happens to be to the right of the
      position occupied by the ** is shifted to the right.  If, as is  likely,
      the next line is to start a new line, then either a * or a - must appear
      at the start of the next line.  The ** is taken to be  equivalent  to  a
      single space if and when the finished resume is typeset.

      For example, the following lines of text

      1978*^Little ^Bank ^and ^Trust ^Company**New York
      *_Teller
      *Responsible for the handling of many cents each day

      would produce the following lines in the resume.

      1978    Little Bank and Trust Company               New York
              Teller              ______
              Responsible for the handling of many cents each day

      in  which  the  company  name  would  be  darkened  and  the  job  title
      underlined.   Since  the  terminal  which  is  being  used  to input the
      contents of the  resume  probably  cannot  itself  display  darkened  or
      underlined  characters,  such  specially modified characters are instead
      indicated when a proof of the resume is displayed  on  the  terminal  by
      their being underlined with circumflexs or underscores, respectively, on
      the next line.  Each of the specially modified characters is  underlined
      although  each  word  only  had  to  be marked once when it was typed in
      originally.  The  otherwise  blank  line  which  is  used  to  mark  the
      characters  which  are to be darkened or underlined will not appear when
      the resume is finally typed or typeset.

      The example shown earlier would be displayed  on  the  terminal  in  the
      following manner:

      1978    Little Bank and Trust Company               New York
              ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
              Teller
              ______
              Responsible for the handling of many cents each day

      (For those who might wonder why the ** cannot  automatically  cause  the
      line  in  which it appears to be separate from the lines on either side,
      the reason is that the ** would usually appear rather far to  the  right
      on  the  line in which it is originally typed.  This program breaks long
      input lines into shorter lines that can each be displayed together  with
      a  line  number on a single line on the terminal.  If the program had to
      break the line containing the ** but every line containing a ** were  to18                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


be kept separate, then the short section containing the ** would be kept
separate from the rest of the line of which it originally was a part.)


                       THE "WHAT NEXT?" QUESTION
                       ---  ---- -----  --------

When everything which is to appear in the  EDUCATION  section  has  been
entered,  then  the RETURN key should be pressed an extra time to signal
to the program that nothing more is to be added to this  section.   More
can  be added later, however.  The program will then ask "WHAT NEXT?" If
this is not the first time that  the  program  has  been  used  for  the
current  resume,  then the program will ask the "WHAT NEXT?" question at
the start rather than asking  for  name,  address  and  education.   The
responses  to  the  "WHAT NEXT?" question are all short english language
words.  These words select the various functions which the  program  can
perform.   The  program  will  again ask the "WHAT NEXT?" question after
each newly requested  action  has  been  completed.   The  "WHAT  NEXT?"
question  will,  of  course,  not  be  asked  if  the  program  has been
instructed to save the current version of the resume and then  to  stop.
The question mark key and then the RETURN key can be pressed in response
to the "WHAT NEXT?" question to obtain a list of the possible responses.

For most of the commands which can be issued in response  to  the  "WHAT
NEXT?" question, the entire word does not need to be typed.  Only enough
of the word is needed to unambiguously identify  the  command  from  all
others.   The  TYPE  command  is  the only command which starts with the
letter  T,  so  the  TYPE  command  can  be  selected  by  any  of   the
abbreviations  T,  TY,  TYP or TYPE.  The SUBMIT and CANCEL commands are
considered important  enough,  however,  that  these  commands  must  be
spelled   out  completely.   In  addition,  the  program  will  ask  for
confirmation that  yes,  these  are  really  the  operations  which  are
desired.

Many of the commands which can be selected  in  response  to  the  "WHAT
NEXT?"  question  require that a section be identified by name or that a
line be identified by number.  If the RETURN key is pressed  immediately
after  the command, then the program will ask for the line number or for
the section name.  The line number or section name can also be typed  to
the right of the command.

To select a section which already exists, it is only necessary  to  type
enough  letters  at  the start of the name to unambiguously identify the
section name from all others.  For example, the letters ED would  select
the  EDUCATION  section, provided that no other section has been created
which  starts  with  the  letter  E  followed  by  the  letter  D.   The
capitalization  of  the section name is ignored when an existing section
is being selected.  The letters E and D could both be capitals or  could
both  be  small  letters or one could be a capital and the other a small
letter.  However, when a  new  section  is  being  created  or  when  an
existing  section  is  being renamed, capital letters must be typed only
where capital letters are to appear in  the  new  section  name.   If  a
section  has  been  assigned  a  name which is spelled incorrectly or in
which the capitalization is inconsistent with the rest of resume, then a
RENAME command can be issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question to      The "WHAT NEXT?" Question                                             19


      change the name of the section.  A section name can consist of just  one
      word or of several words.

      The DRAFT command can be issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question
      to  obtain  the number associated with the line which is to be modified.
      Since the program may have to fill the screen several  times  before  it
      gets  to  the desired line, the display can be restricted to the section
      which contains the line by typing the word ONLY in response to the "WHAT
      NEXT?"  question, and then by naming the section which is to be the only
      section displayed by the DRAFT and PROOF commands.  Each line  which  is
      entered into the resume is assigned a line number.  If a line is entered
      which is longer than the width of the screen of the terminal, then  this
      line  will  be  split into smaller pieces each shorter than the width of
      the screen, and each piece will be assigned a line number.

      Numbers are assigned to the lines in the order in which these lines were
      entered.   The line numbers stay the same during a particular run of the
      program.  If a command issued in response to the "WHAT  NEXT?"  question
      inserts a new line between existing lines, then the new line is assigned
      a number just greater than the largest line number currently in use even
      though  this  means  that  there is a discontinuity in the line numbers.
      Likewise, deleting a line leaves a gap in the line  numbering  sequence.
      The  original line numbers are retained because the line numbers tend to
      be associated with particular lines.  Having the number 10  point  to  a
      particular line for awhile but later to another would lead to confusion.
      However, each time the program is run, the line numbers  are  reassigned
      starting  at  1  and incremented by 1 for each line, since it is assumed
      that enough time has passed that the original  association  between  the
      numbers and the lines will have been forgotten.

      The following commands can be issued in response  to  the  "WHAT  NEXT?"
      question.

      AFTER   and a line number to insert a new line after the indicated line.
              The  BEFORE  command  can be used to insert a new line before an
              existing line.

      ALL     so that the DRAFT and PROOF commands will display all  sections.
              The  ONLY  command  can be used later to select the display of a
              particular section.  Also, if any other command is issued  which
              references  a  particular  section,  then  the  DRAFT  and PROFF
              commands will only display that section.  For  example,  if  the
              CREATE  command  is used to create a new section or if an APPEND
              command is used to append to an  existing  section,  then  these
              become the selected sections.

      APPEND  and a section name to append several new lines to the end of  an
              existing  section.  The CREATE command should be used instead to
              create an entirely new section.

      BEFORE  and a line number to insert a  new  line  before  the  indicated
              line.   The AFTER command can be used to insert a new line after
              an existing line.20                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


BREAK   and a line number to specify that the  words  on  the  indicated
        line  are  not  to  be  placed to the right of those on the line
        preceding it.  The BULLET command should be used if the line  is
        to  start  with a bullet.  The BREAK command inserts an asterisk
        at the start of the line and the BULLET command inserts a  minus
        sign.  These characters could also be inserted explicitly by use
        of the EDIT command.  Any asterisk or minus sign already at  the
        start of the line is removed.  The EDIT command can also be used
        to split an existing line.

BULLET  and a line number to cause the indicated line to  begin  with  a
        bullet.   This  inserts  a  minus sign at the start of the line.
        Any asterisk or minus sign already at the start of the  line  is
        removed.   The  minus  sign could also be inserted explicitly by
        the use of the EDIT command.  The EDIT command can also be  used
        to split an existing line, inserting a bullet at the break.

CANCEL  to cancel the current resume and then to start over.  Everything
        currently  in the resume will be lost and the program will again
        ask for name, address and education, exactly as if  the  program
        had  been  run  the  first  time.   The CANCEL command cannot be
        abbreviated.  The  word  CANCEL  must  be  spelled  out  in  its
        entirety.   To further insure that this command is not issued by
        accident,  the  program  will  warn  of  the   consequences   of
        proceeding  with  this  command.   The program will then ask for
        confirmation that yes,  the  current  resume  is  really  to  be
        cancelled.

CREATE  and a new section name  to  create  a  new  section  having  the
        indicated   name.    The   section   name   should  be  entirely
        capitalized.  The RENAME command can be used later to change the
        spelling or the capitalization of the section name.

DELETE  and a line number to delete the  indicated  line.   The  current
        contents  of  the  line will be displayed.  The program will ask
        for confirmation that yes, this line is really  to  be  deleted.
        The  line number will not be reused until the next time that the
        program is run.  The REPLACE command  can  be  used  instead  to
        replace  the  entire  contents of an existing line retaining the
        original line number.

DRAFT   to display the current section or the entire resume  as  it  was
        originally  entered.   A  line number will appear to the left of
        each line.  Only the words which were typed together on the same
        line,  i.e.  before  the  RETURN  key was pressed, will be shown
        together.  Long lines will usually  be  shown  divided  up  into
        shorter  ones  each  with its own line number.  Asterisks, minus
        signs, circumflexes and underscores  will  all  be  shown  where
        these  appear  in  the  text.  If an ALL command has been issued
        recently, then the entire resume will be displayed.  If an  ONLY
        command  or  any other command which references a single section
        has been issued more recently than an ALL command, then only the
        single  section  will  be  displayed.   The PROOF command can be
        issued instead to display the finished resume but with  slightly
        shorter  lines than will be used in the typed or printed version      The "WHAT NEXT?" Question                                             21


              of the resume.

      EDIT    and a line number to change part of  the  indicated  line.   The
              REPLACE  command  should  be used instead if the contents of the
              entire line are to be replaced.  The EDIT command can be used to
              insert,   delete,  capitalize,  darken  or  underline  a  single
              character, a word or an entire phrase.  The program will display
              the contents of the line and will ask for the character, word or
              phrase which is to  be  modified  or  which  appears  where  the
              insertion  is  to be made.  The program will then search for the
              leftmost appearance of the character,  word  or  phrase  in  the
              line.   The line will be displayed again with the item which was
              found being marked.  The program will ask how this item is to be
              modified.   If  the  character, word or phrase appears more than
              once in the line and the appearance which was found is  not  the
              proper  one,  then  these appearances must be stepped through in
              turn until the proper appearance is  reached.   There  are  many
              editing  capabilities.  These are described in detail in a later
              section of this manual.

      EXIT    to save the current version of the resume, and then to exit from
              the  program.  This program can be run again later to revise the
              resume.  In order to have the resume be included  in  the  final
              collection of resumes being assembled by the school, the program
              must be run again and the  SUBMIT  command  must  be  issued  to
              indicate  that  the  resume  has been finished.  Once the SUBMIT
              command has been issued, the resume cannot be revised further.

      JOIN    and a line number to specify that the  words  on  the  indicated
              line  can  be placed to the right of those on the line preceding
              it.  The JOIN command removes the asterisk  or  the  minus  sign
              from  the  start  of  the  line.  It cannot be used to remove an
              asterisk which appears to the right of  a  date  or  other  item
              which  is  to  appear  to the left of the left margin.  The EDIT
              command  can  be  used  to  explicitly  remove  any   of   these
              characters.

      LENGTH  to calculate the length of the finished resume.  If  the  resume
              is  to  be restricted to a single page, then the number of lines
              which are required will be reported.  If the resume  is  allowed
              to  continue onto following pages, then both the total number of
              pages required and the number of lines on the final page will be
              reported.   The  number  of characters on a line and the maximum
              number of lines per page will vary depending  upon  whether  the
              final  resumes  are  being  typed  or  typeset.  Both the actual
              length and the maximum allowed length will be reported.

              If the final resume collection  will  be  typed  on  the  letter
              quality  typewriter, then the LENGTH command also checks whether
              the resume contains  any  unavailable  characters.   The  letter
              quality  typewriter  which  is  used  to  type  the final resume
              collection cannot produce all of the  characters  which  can  be
              shown   on  the  video  terminals.   The  characters  which  are
              unavailable include the following:22                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


        The left square bracket [ The right square bracket ]
        The left brace {          The right brace }
        The less than sign <      The greater than sign >
        The accent grave `        The tilde ~
        The reverse slash \       The vertical bar |

        The SUBMIT command cannot successfully indicate that the  resume
        is  ready  to be included in the resume collection if the resume
        is too long or if it contains any unavailable characters.

MOVE    and a section name to move the indicated section to  a  location
        before  another section.  The name of the second section must be
        specified on a  separate  line  since  such  section  names  can
        consist  of  more  than  just  a single word.  The sections will
        appear in the finished resume in the order in which the sections
        are  shown  by  the  DRAFT  and  PROOF  commands.   However, the
        sections having the names NAME, LOCAL and PERMANENT are  assumed
        to  contain  the  name,  local  address  and  permanent  address
        respectively, and are printed at the top of the finished  resume
        regardless  of  the  location  of these sections relative to the
        other sections and regardless of  their  locations  relative  to
        each other.

ONLY    and a section name so that the DRAFT  and  PROOF  commands  will
        show  only  the  indicated  section.   Any  other  command which
        references a single section will also cause the DRAFT and  PROOF
        commands to only show the indicated section.  An ALL command can
        be used later so that the DRAFT and PROOF commands will show the
        entire resume.

PAPER   to write the current version of the resume to a file  which  can
        be  typed  or  printed later, and then to exit from the program.
        The file is expendable, and can be modified or  deleted  without
        altering  the  program's  own record of what is contained in the
        resume.  The program can  be  run  again  later  to  revise  the
        resume.

        The program will ask which of several formats is  desired.   The
        format  which  should  be  selected will depend upon the type of
        terminal or printer which will be used to  display  the  current
        version  of  the resume, and whether the final resume collection
        will be typed or typeset.  When the program asks for the format,
        pressing  only  the  RETURN  key  can be used to cause the PAPER
        command to not be acted upon, and  to  cause  the  "WHAT  NEXT?"
        question to be asked again.

PROOF   to display a formatted version of the current section or of  the
        entire  resume.   The  lines  will  be shorter than in the final
        resume, however, since the computer terminal cannot show as many
        characters  across  the  width  of  a page as will appear in the
        final  copies  of  the  resumes.   The  entire  resume  will  be
        displayed  if  an  ALL command has been issued recently.  Only a
        single section will be displayed  if  an  ONLY  command  or  any
        command  which  references a single section has been issued more
        recently than an ALL command.  The DRAFT  command  can  be  used      The "WHAT NEXT?" Question                                             23


              instead  to  display  the  original contents of the lines in the
              resume or in a section of the resume.

      RENAME  and a section name to change the name of the indicated  section.
              The program will ask for the new section name to be specified on
              a separate line.  The RENAME command can be used to correct  the
              spelling  or  capitalization  of a section name or to change the
              section name to something entirely different.  The  new  section
              name  will  include  capital  (upper  case)  letters  only where
              capital letters are explicitly typed.

      REPLACE and a line number to replace the entire contents of an  existing
              line.   The former contents of the line will be displayed first.
              The program will ask for confirmation that  yes,  this  line  is
              really  to be replaced.  The program will then ask what the line
              is to contain instead.  The new contents  of  the  line  can  be
              longer  than  the width of the screen.  Whatever is typed before
              the RETURN key is pressed replaces the former  contents  of  the
              line.   If  a long line is typed, then this line will be divided
              into shorter lines in the draft of the resume, and each of these
              portions  will  be  assigned  its  own line number.  The REPLACE
              command cannot be used to delete a  line.   The  DELETE  command
              should  be  used  instead if the line is to be deleted.  If only
              the RETURN key is pressed when the  program  asks  for  the  new
              contents  of  the  line,  then  the REPLACE command is not acted
              upon.

      RULE    and a new section name to create a section having this name from
              the lower portion of an existing section.  The program will then
              ask for the number of the line which is to be the first line  of
              the  new  section.  The line number cannot be typed to the right
              of the section name since the section name could itself  contain
              a  number.   The  name of the new section can consist of 1 or of
              several words.  As is  the  case  with  the  new  section  names
              assigned  by the CREATE and RENAME commands, the name of the new
              section will be  capitalized  only  where  capital  letters  are
              typed.

      SAVE    to save the current version of the resume, but not exit from the
              program.   Additional revisions can still be made to the resume.
              Issuing the SAVE command assures that the changes  made  to  the
              resume prior to the issuing of the SAVE command will be retained
              even if the  computer  system  should  happen  to  die.   It  is
              suggested  that  a current version of the resume should be saved
              every 15  or  20  minutes.   Even  if  a  SAVE  command  is  not
              explicitly  issued,  the  current  version of the resume will be
              saved whenever approximately 33  lines  have  been  inserted  or
              replaced,  or  whenever approximately 100 changes have been made
              to existing lines.  The PAPER and the EXIT  commands  also  save
              the  current  version of the resume, but the program then stops.
              If the PAPER command is issued, the program also writes  a  file
              into  the  local  disk area which contains an expendable copy of
              the resume which can be printed on the fast printer or typed  on
              the letter quality typewriter.24                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


SKIP    and a line number to  cause  a  blank  line  to  appear  in  the
        resulting  resume above the indicated line.  This merely inserts
        an extra line which contains only an  asterisk  into  the  rough
        form of resume.  The BEFORE command could also be used to insert
        a line containing only an asterisk.

SUBMIT  to indicate that the current version of the resume is  ready  to
        be  included in the collection of resumes being assembled by the
        school.  The SUBMIT command cannot  be  abbreviated.   The  word
        SUBMIT  must  be spelled out in its entirety.  To further insure
        that this command is not issued by accident,  the  program  will
        warn  of  the consequences of proceeding with this command.  The
        program will ask for confirmation that yes, the resume really is
        finished and is ready to be included in the resume collection.

        The program will not allow the resume to  be  submitted  if  the
        resume  is  too  long or if it contains characters which are not
        available on the device upon which  the  final  version  of  the
        resume collection will be produced.  The LENGTH command can also
        be issued in response to the  "WHAT  NEXT?"  question  to  check
        whether  these  requirements  are  met.   The description of the
        LENGTH command should be consulted for further information.

        After the SUBMIT  command  has  been  issued  successfully,  the
        resume  cannot be changed further.  If the RESUME program is run
        again after the resume has been submitted, then the program will
        allow  the writing of a copy of the resume into a file which can
        be printed or typed, but the resume cannot be  revised  further.
        If  an  error  is  discovered  in  a submitted resume before the
        deadline for the submission of  all  resumes,  then  the  RESUME
        program  administrator  will  have  to be asked to allow further
        revisions of the resume.  However, the resume would then have to
        be  submitted  again  in  order  to  be  included  in the resume
        collection.

SWITCH  and 3 line numbers to move several lines within a section.  Only
        the  first  line  number  can  appear to the right of the SWITCH
        command.  The  others  must  be  typed  separately.   The  lines
        identified  by  the  first  and second numbers are moved to just
        above the line identified by the third number.  The first number
        identifies  the  top  line  to  be  moved.   The  second  number
        identifies the bottom line to be moved.  The  first  and  second
        number would be the same if only 1 line is to be moved.

        The easiest procedure to insert several lines into the middle of
        a section is to use the APPEND command to append them to the end
        of the section.  Then the DRAFT command can be used to find  the
        numbers  of  the top and bottom lines and the number of the line
        before which these line are to be placed.  Finally,  the  SWITCH
        command can be used to rearrange the lines.

TYPE    and a line number to display the indicated line on the terminal.
        Most  commands  which  modify  particular  lines or do something
        relative to a particular line also display the line and ask  for
        confirmation that the displayed line is the line actually meant.      The "WHAT NEXT?" Question                                             25


      UNRULE  and a section name to  merge  the  indicated  section  with  the
              preceding  section.  The RULE command can later be used to split
              the sections apart again.


                                 CORRECTING ERRORS
                                 ---------- ------

      If an error is detected in a line  as  it  is  being  typed  in  on  the
      terminal,  the  key  which is marked either DEL or RUBOUT can be used to
      erase the characters to the right of the error and  then  to  erase  the
      error  itself.   Each  time that this key is pressed, one more character
      will be erased.  When the error itself has disappeared,  the  correction
      and the rest of the line can be typed again.  Errors CANNOT be corrected
      by the use of the cursor keys (those marked with  arrows)  or  with  the
      BACKSPACE  key.   In  particular,  the cursor keys and the BACKSPACE key
      cannot be used to return to and correct errors in lines which appear  on
      the  screen  above  the  line  which  is currently being typed in on the
      terminal.  This program is not a  video  editor  which  would  allow  an
      active  cursor  to  be  moved  around  the screen.  This program instead
      processes each line when  the  RETURN  key  is  pressed.   Although  the
      previous  dialog between the student and the program remains visible for
      awhile on the screen, the previous lines cannot  be  changed  by  typing
      over them.

      If the RETURN key has already been pressed, or if more  has  been  typed
      than will fit across the width of the screen, then the entry of the text
      into the section must be finished before the error can be corrected.  At
      that time, a DRAFT command can be issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?"
      request to discover the number of the line in error.  If the contents of
      the  line are completely wrong, then the entire line should be replaced.
      This can be requested by typing the word REPLACE followed  by  the  line
      number  in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question.  The program will then
      ask for the new contents of the line.

      If the contents of the line are largely correct, then just  the  portion
      which  is  in error should be modified.  This can be requested by typing
      the EDIT command followed by the line number.  Once the EDIT command has
      been  issued,  several  modifications  can  be  performed in turn on the
      selected line.  After each modification has been completed, the  program
      will  ask  if  the  editing of the line has been completed.  However, to
      modify some other line, the EDIT command would have to be selected again
      in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question.

      The EDIT command searches for a sequence of characters selected  by  the
      student,  and  then  either  modifies  this  sequence  of  characters or
      performs some operation adjacent to the  sequence  of  characters.   The
      item  which is searched for can appear within a word or can consist of a
      sequence of words.  The cases  of  alphabetic  letters  are  ignored  in
      finding the characters.  The student can type all capital letters or all
      small letters and still match the sequence of the same  letters  in  the
      line.   The  student  usually  does  not  need  to  type underscores and
      circumflexes  which  appear  in  the  line.   However,  underscores  and
      circumflexes which appear at unusual locations, for example at the right
      ends of words, sometimes have to be explicitly  typed  in  order  to  be26                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


matched.

The EDIT command can be used to perform any of the following operations.

 1.  Deletion of an item.

 2.  Replacement of an item by something else.  To  insert  a  space  in
     "thejob",  search  for  ej  without the space and replace it by e j
     with the space.

 3.  Conversion  of  an  item  to  upper  case  or  to  lower  case   or
     capitalization of only the first letter in each word in an item.

 4.  Causing an item to be darker  than  normal,  to  be  underlined  or
     causing  an item to be typed normally without darkening and without
     underlining.

 5.  Insertion of a word or a phrase either to the left or to the  right
     of an item.

 6.  Attachment of a letter or a sequence of letters either to the  left
     end or to the right end of an item.

 7.  Insertion of a space to the left of an item, but not to its  right.
     To insert a space in "thejob", search for the word job.

 8.  Causing an item to begin a new  line  in  the  resulting  document.
     Optionally, the new line can begin with a bullet.

 9.  Searching for the next occurrence of an item on the same line.

When the item has been located, the program will display the entire line
containing  the  item.   The  item  just  found  will be marked by being
underlined with plus signs in an extra, otherwise blank line which  will
be  displayed below the line containing the item.  The program will then
ask "EDIT HOW?" to determine how  the  item  is  to  be  modified.   The
possible  responses  to  this  question  are  all short English language
words.  Where similar operations can be performed both  in  response  to
the  "WHAT  NEXT?" question and in response to the "EDIT HOW?" question,
the same command words have been chosen for both sets of commands.   The
RETURN  key  can  be pressed without typing anything else if the item is
not to be modified.

The commands which can be issued in response to the "EDIT HOW?" question
are listed below.

AFTER   to insert a word or a phrase to  the  right  of  the  item  just
        found.   The  program  will  ask if the item just found is to be
        attached or separate from the text which is to be inserted.  The
        program  will then ask for the text which is to be inserted.  If
        the item is to be  separate,  then  a  space  will  be  inserted
        between the item just found and the inserted text.      Correcting Errors                                                     27


      BEFORE  to insert a word or a phrase to the left of the item just found.
              The program will ask if the item just found is to be attached or
              separate from the text which is to  be  inserted.   The  program
              will then ask for the text which is to be inserted.  If the item
              is to be separate, then a space will  be  inserted  between  the
              inserted text and the item just found.

      BOLD    to insert a circumflex at the start of a word or at the start of
              each  word  of  a  phrase  to cause the word or the phrase to be
              darker than normal.

      BREAK   to cause the item just found to appear at the  start  of  a  new
              line  in  the  finished  resume.   The line being edited will be
              split just to the left of the item just found  and  an  asterisk
              will be inserted immediately before this item.

      BULLET  to cause the item just found to appear at the  start  of  a  new
              line  which bears a bullet in the resume.  The line being edited
              will be split just to the left of the  item  just  found  and  a
              minus sign will be inserted immediately before this item.

      DELETE  to delete the item just found.

      LOWER   to convert all of the alphabetic letters in the word  or  phrase
              to lower case or small letters.

      MIXED   to convert the first letter of the word or of each of the  words
              in  a phrase to upper case or capital letters and to convert the
              second and subsequent letters to lower case  or  small  letters.
              Either "the job" or "THE JOB" would be converted to "The Job".

      NEXT    to search for the next appearance of the same  item  further  to
              the right in the line.

      NORMAL  to remove the underscore or the circumflex at  the  start  of  a
              word  or  at the start of each word of a phrase to keep the word
              or the phrase from being underlined and from being  darker  than
              normal.

      REPLACE to replace the item just found by something else.  To  remove  a
              space  incorrectly  typed  within a word or between a word and a
              following punctuation mark, it is necessary to  search  for  the
              two  parts, issue a REPLACE editing command, and type in the two
              parts without the space.  To convert "jo b" to "job", search for
              jo b including the space, issue the REPLACE command, and replace
              by job without the space.

              The REPLACE editing command can similarly be used  to  insert  a
              space  between  2 words which were incorrectly run together.  To
              convert "thejob" to "the job", search  for  the  combined  words
              without the space and simply replace them by the same words with
              the correct spacing.  The SPACE command  can  also  be  used  to
              insert a space to the left of an item.28                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


SPACE   to insert a space to the left of  the  item  just  found.   This
        would be used if 2 words were incorrectly run together without a
        separating space.  To convert "thejob" to "the job", search  for
        the  word  job,  and  then issue the SPACE editing command.  The
        REPLACE editing command  could  also  be  used  to  replace  the
        combined words by the same words with the correct spacing.

UNDERLINE to insert an underscore at the start of a word or at the start
        of  each  word of a phrase to cause the word or the phrase to be
        underlined in the finished resume.

UPPER   to convert all of the alphabetic letters in the word  or  phrase
        to upper case or capital letters.


                  OBTAINING A PAPER COPY OF THE RESUME
                  --------- - ----- ---- -- --- ------

The PAPER command can be issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question
to  obtain  a  file  containing  a  copy of the resume which can then be
printed on the fast printer or typed on the letter  quality  typewriter.
This  file  will  be written into the disk area belonging to the account
which is being used to run the program.  The file is expendable, and can
be modified or deleted without altering the program's own record of what
is contained in the resume.  The program will stop after  the  file  has
been  written.  The program can be run again later to revise the resume.
If the program is run after the final version of  the  resume  has  been
submitted for inclusion in the resume collection, then the only function
which the program will perform is the production of the file  which  can
be printed or typed.

After the PAPER command has been issued, the program will ask  which  of
several  formats is desired.  The format which is selected should depend
upon the type of terminal or printer which will be used, and whether the
resume  collection will itself be typed or typeset.  The following words
can be used to specify the desired format.  If  the  PAPER  command  was
issued  by accident, then only the RETURN key should be pressed so as to
cause the "WHAT NEXT?" question to be asked again.

NARROW  if the fast printer will be used to check the contents  but  not
        the line lengths of a resume.  The resulting file can be printed
        on narrow paper.  The lines in the resume will each  contain  up
        to 80 characters.

PRINTED if the fast printer will be used to check the contents  and  the
        line  lengths of a resume for which the final copy will be typed
        on the letter quality typewriter.  The  resulting  file  can  be
        printed  on  narrow  paper  if  the  printer  is  set to give 12
        characters per inch.  The lines in the resume will each  contain
        up  to  87 characters.  The file can also be typed on the letter
        quality typewriter but darkened characters will not be typed  as
        well as if the TYPED option were used instead.      Obtaining a Paper Copy of The Resume                                  29


      TYPED   if the letter quality  typewriter  will  be  used  to  type  the
              resume.   The  letter  quality typewriter must be set to give 12
              characters per inch.  The lines in the resume will each  contain
              up to 87 characters, so the typed resume will 7 and 1/4th inches
              wide.  The resulting file cannot be printed on the fast  printer
              since  it  contains  instructions  for darkening some characters
              which can  only  be  properly  handled  by  the  letter  quality
              typewriter.

      TYPESET if the fast printer will be used to check the  appearance  of  a
              resume which will be typeset.  THIS FORMAT SHOULD NOT BE USED IF
              THE RESUME COLLECTION WILL BE TYPED RATHER  THAN  TYPESET.   The
              number  of characters on each line will depend upon the relative
              numbers of narrow versus wide characters.  More words  will  fit
              on  a line if the words contain few wide characters such as M or
              W.  The resulting file must be printed on wide paper.

      This program will report the name of the file which contains the copy of
      the  resume.   The file will be named RESUME.DOC if the student is using
      his or her own account to run this program.  However, the file will have
      a  name  consisting  of  a 6 digit number followed by the suffix .DOC if
      this program is being run from an account which is being used by several
      students.  If the student who is running the program has been assigned a
      number and password combination which is used  to  gain  access  to  the
      program,  then  the  6  digit number will merely be the number which was
      used to gain access to the program, but  with  leading  zeros.   If  the
      student  who  is  running  the program selected his or her own password,
      rather than being assigned one,  then  the  number  is  based  upon  the
      password.  The program will report the name of the file before it halts.
      A record should be kept of the file name since it is used to  keep  each
      resume separate from those belonging to the other students.

      The word PRINT and the file name can be typed by the student  after  the
      program  has  exited  (i.e.,  when  the computer is prompting with the @
      character) to cause the file to be printed on the fast printer.  If  the
      file  is named 001234.DOC, then the file would be printed if the student
      typed

      PRINT 001234.DOC

      The following operations must be performed  to  type  the  file  on  the
      letter  quality  typewriter.   These instructions are specific for using
      the HC program at the Yale School of Management to type a  file  on  the
      Diablo  1620  terminal.   The  procedures will differ elsewhere.  The HC
      program allows the typing of pages which  are  separated  by  form  feed
      characters in a file onto separate pieces of paper.

       1.  Log in on the typewriter.

       2.  Type HC and press the  RETURN  key.   This  starts  the  hard  copy
           program.  The HC program will respond by typing an asterisk.

       3.  Type the name of the file and then press the RETURN  key.   The  HC
           program  will  complain  if it cannot find the file or if it cannot
           understand the manner in which the file  name  was  typed.   If  an30                                            RESUME Program Users Guide


     error  message is typed, then the file name will have to be entered
     again.  The file is ready to be typed if the HC  program  does  not
     type anything in response.

 4.  Put a clean sheet of paper into the terminal.

 5.  Adjust the horizontal position of the paper so that the  left  edge
     is  flush  with  the  left  edge  of  the  platen (the large rubber
     cylinder behind the paper).  This will  give  the  same  wide  left
     margin  as  will  be used in the resume book.  To center the resume
     instead, have the left edge of the paper be 5/16 inch to the  right
     of the left edge of the platen.

 6.  Adjust the vertical position of the paper so that the  top  of  the
     paper  is  even  with  the  top of the shiny chromed guard plate in
     front of the printhead.  Turn the knob at the end of the  platen  2
     clicks  so  that  about  1/6th  of an inch of paper shows above the
     guard plate.

 7.  Make sure that the printer bail (the rod with the  rubber  rollers)
     is in its position farthest away from the platen.

 8.  Press the G key to start the typing.  This tells the HC program  to
     GO.  The RETURN key does not have to be pressed.

 9.  After a few lines have been typed,  push  the  paper  bail  to  its
     position  holding  down  the paper.  If the bail is pushed down too
     early, it will catch on the top of the paper.

10.  If the resume is continued onto additional  pages,  insert  another
     sheet of paper and press the G key again.

11.  When the typing of the resume has finished  and  if  an  additional
     copy  of the resume is needed, then put another piece of paper into
     the terminal and press the R key.  Do not  press  the  RETURN  key.
     This tells the HC program to REPEAT the same file.

12.  If an additional copy of the resume is  not  needed,  put  a  scrap
     piece  of  paper  into the terminal.  If someone else from the same
     class is waiting to print a resume, press the E (for  END)  key  to
     get  the  HC  program  ready  to  accept another file name.  The HC
     program will respond by typing just an asterisk.

13.  To exit from the program after the last page of the resume has been
     typed,  press  the  Z  key  instead of the E key.  If the E key has
     already been  pressed  so  that  HC  has  responded  by  typing  an
     asterisk,  then the control key will have to be held down and the C
     key will have to be pressed while the control key  is  still  being
     held down.      Changing How Long Sections of Text are Displayed                      31


            Changing How Long Sections of Text are Displayed on Terminal
            -------- --- ---- -------- -- ---- --- --------- -- --------

      Long sections of text, for example the various instruction messages  and
      drafts  or  proofs  of  the  resume, either can be typed to the terminal
      without stopping, or can be parceled out in pages of uniform length with
      the  typing  pausing  at the bottom of each page.  Continuous display is
      appropriate if a terminal which types onto paper  is  being  used.   The
      student  can  then  just look back at the previous printout to read what
      has been printed.  Pausing after  each  page  is  appropriate  to  video
      terminals  on which information, once it has been pushed off the screen,
      is lost.

      The RESUME program administrator will adjust the program for the type of
      terminal  being  used  by  most of the students in each class.  If a few
      students in the class use some other type of  terminal  then  they  will
      have  to  individually adjust the program for the type of terminal which
      they are using.  This will have to be done each time that they  run  the
      program.   The  program probably should be adjusted for a different type
      of terminal if information is being lost when a video terminal is  used,
      or  if  the  RETURN  key  must be pressed repeatedly to have the program
      continue the typing of  long  sections  of  text  when  a  paper  output
      terminal is used.

      The following commands can be typed in  response  to  the  "WHAT  NEXT?"
      question  to  adjust  the  program  for the type of terminal being used.
      These commands can also be typed in response  to  the  initial  question
      asked  by  the  program  about whether general instructions are desired.
      However, the existence of these commands is not revealed then  unless  a
      question mark happens to be typed in response to that question.

      SLOW    if this program is being run from a terminal  which  types  onto
              paper.   The  program  will  not  pause  in  the  middle of long
              sections of text.  The  terminal  is  expected  to  be  able  to
              display at least 80 characters per line.

      FAST    if this program is being run from a video terminal which scrolls
              the  lines  currently being displayed upwards to display the new
              lines at the bottom and discards the oldest lines  at  the  top.
              The  terminal cannot clear the screen when a form feed character
              is issued.  The  program  will  pause  in  the  middle  of  long
              sections  of  text  whenever the next line would force the first
              line on the page off the top of the screen.  The RETURN key  can
              be  pressed  to  tell  the  program to continue.  The screen can
              display 24 lines of 80 characters each.

      PAGING  if this program is being run from a fast  video  terminal  which
              can  clear  the  screen  when  the  program  issues  a form feed
              character.  The program will  scroll  short  dialogs,  but  will
              clear  the  screen  before typing drafts or proofs of the resume
              and before typing lengthy instructions.  The program will  pause
              in  the  middle  of  long  sections  of text whenever the screen
              fills.  The RETURN key can be pressed to  tell  the  program  to
              continue.   The  screen  can  display  24 lines of 80 characters
              each.32                                            RESUME Program Users Guide

      The same resume is shown below as it would be displayed on the  terminal
      when a DRAFT command is issued in response to the "WHAT NEXT?" question.
      The lines which do not start with numbers contain  section  names.   The
      numbers which appear to the left of most of the lines are the numbers by
      which these lines must be identified to be modified.  The text in  these
      lines is identical to that which was typed in by the student except that
      lines which were longer than the width of the screen  have  been  broken
      into shorter lines by the program.

A PROOF command issued in response to the "WHAT  NEXT?"  question  would
display  this  resume  on the terminal in the form which is shown below.
Bold letters are indicated by pointing to them with circumflexes  on  an
extra otherwise blank line below them.  Underlined letters are similarly
indicated by underlining them on the next line.  The indication of  bold
letters  and  underlined letters on the next line is necessary since the
video terminals from which the RESUME program is  used  cannot  directly
display bold letters or underlined letters.
