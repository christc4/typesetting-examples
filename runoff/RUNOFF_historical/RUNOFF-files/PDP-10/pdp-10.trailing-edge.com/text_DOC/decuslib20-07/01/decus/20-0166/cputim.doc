                                CPUTIM


	CPUTIM monitors cpu usage in some interval of time. This
program takes the time interval from a file called CPU.INI and
monitors the cpu for that amount of time. After the time is reached
program will list users in ascending order by the time of cpu they
used in that interval. This program is a very good way to detect
system heavy users. This program does not take any commands.
