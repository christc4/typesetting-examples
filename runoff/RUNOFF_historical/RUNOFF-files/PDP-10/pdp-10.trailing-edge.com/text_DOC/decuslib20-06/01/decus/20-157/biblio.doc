                                 (VERSION 2.0)






               1.0  INTRODUCTION


               BIBLIO is a program which creates  and/or  searches  through

               bibliographical  references  in a data file on the computer.

               Its capabilities include:



                 - Creating a data file

                 - Appending bibliographical references to an old data file

                 - Finding the next match of a search string in a data file

                 - Finding all matches of a search string in a data file

                 - Editing the data file



               BIBLIO was written by Mike Rubin of the  Wesleyan  Computing

               Center in June, 1979.




               2.0  TYPOGRAPHICAL CONVENTIONS


               The (CR) notation represents the carriage return key (RETURN

               or NEW LINE) on the terminal keyboard.



               The notation CTRL-<character> represents a control character

     User Guide to BIBLIO                                            Page 3


               typed  by  holding  down  the  CONTROL  or  CTRL  key on the

               terminal keyboard and typing the character.




               3.0  RUNNING BIBLIO


                    To run BIBLIO,  type  .RUN  BIBLIO(CR) .   BIBLIO  will                                          _

               respond with:


                    Data file name:


                    The user should type in the name of the  data  file  he

               wishes to create and/or use followed by a (CR).


                    BIBLIO will then ask for a command, and the user should

               type in one of the commands listed below.




               4.0  COMMANDS


               4.1  The H (Help) Command


               The form of the Help command is:


                    H(CR)



               This command will type out a short help text on the terminal

               and then return to BIBLIO command mode.

     User Guide to BIBLIO                                            Page 4


               4.2  The E (Exit) Command


               The form of the Exit command is:


                    E(CR)



               This command will return the user to monitor  command  mode.

               The  user  may  also type CTRL-C at any time to exit BIBLIO.

               If CTRL-C is typed while the user  is  inserting  an  entry,

               that entry will not be inserted in the data file.




               4.3  The N (Name) Command


               The form of the Name command is:


                    N(CR)



               This command will prompt BIBLIO to again ask for a data file

               name, and subsequent commands will apply to the file named.




               4.4  The I (Insert) Command


               The form of the Insert command is:


                    I(CR)



               This command has two purposes.


               1. If the data file named does not exist, the Insert command

               will create the file and insert the first entry into it.

     User Guide to BIBLIO                                            Page 5


               2. If the data file named does  exist,  the  Insert  command

               will  insert  a  new  entry  before  the current entry.  The

               current entry is defined as  the  entry  last  displayed  or

               edited.



               This command will clear the screen and ask for text to  fill

               each of four fields: (1)title, (2)author, (3)publication and

               page references, and (4)summary/abstract.

               The information placed in each field consists of one or more

               lines  of  characters  terminated  by  a  CTRL-Z.  After all

               fields have been filled, BIBLIO will return to command mode.

               It  is  not  necessary to type (CR) after the last line of a

               field has been inserted.




               4.5  The A (Append) Command


               The form of the Append command is:


                    A(CR)



               This command will prompt BIBLIO to ask the  same  series  of

               questions  as for the Insert command.  (See section 4.4.) It

               will append this new entry to the end of the data file.

               4.6  The T (Type) Command


               The form of the Type command is:


                    T(CR)



               This  command  will  type  out  the  current  entry  on  the

               terminal.




               4.7  The P (Page) Command


               The form of the Page command is:


                    P(CR)



               This command will type out the next entry, i.e.,  the  entry

               following  the  current  entry,  on  the  terminal.   Typing

               successive Page commands will page through the file.




               4.8  The B (Begin) Command


               The form of the Begin command is:


                    B(CR)



               This command defines the current entry as the first entry in

               the data file.

               4.9  The F (Find) Command


               The form of the Find command is:


                    F[<fields to search>][:<search string>](CR)


                    where <search string>  can  be  any  series  of  words,

               square brackets [] indicate an optional part of the command,

               and <fields to search> can be one or more of  the  following

               codes:



                    A   Author fields

                    R   Reference fields

                    S   Summary/abstract fields

                    T   Title fields



               If no field codes are given, all fields  will  be  searched.

               This  command will find the first match of the search string

               in the data file and type out the entry in which  the  match

               was  made  on  the  terminal.   A  match  is  defined as the

               presence of every word in the search  string  in  any  order

               within  a  single  field.   The upper and lower cases of the

               same letter are treated as the same character.  To find  the

               next match of the search string, type:


                    F(CR)

                                                  "FORTRAN    programming,"

                                                  and  type  the  entry  in

                                                  which  the match was made

                                                  on the terminal.

             Command: F(CR)                       Find the  next  match  of             ________

               4.10  The S (Search) Command


               The basic form of the Search command is:


                    S[<fields to search>][:<search string>](CR)



               This command will write all entries  containing  matches  of

               the  search  string  to  a  file  whose  name is of the form

               Q??.LPT, where the question marks  will  be  letters  and/or

               numbers.   Field codes may be given with the Search commands

               as for the Find command.  (See section 4.9.)

               If no search string is given, and if the last command was  a

               successful  Find  command  (i.e.,  The match was made.), the

               Search command will use the same search string that the Find

               command used.



               For example:


             Command: F:ALGOL                     Find the first  match  of             ________

                                                  "ALGOL," and type out the

                                                  entry in which it  occurs

                                                  on the terminal.

             Command: SST                         Search for all matches of             ________

                                                  "ALGOL" in just Title and

                                                  Summary field, and  write

                                                  all   entries   in  which

                                                  matches  are  made  to  a

                                                  file of the form Q??.LPT.

               The form of the Dump command is:


                    D(CR)



               This  command  will  create  a  file  of  the  form  Q??.LPT

               consisting  of a complete listing in report form of the data

               file.




               4.12  The K (Kill) Command


               The form of the Kill command is:


                    K(CR)



               This command will delete the current entry.




               4.13  The R (Replace) Command


               The form of the Replace command is:


                    R[<list of fields to replace>](CR)



               This command  will  replace  fields  in  the  current  entry

               specified  by the field codes.  The field codes are the same

               as for the Find and Search commands.  (See sections 4.9  and

               4.10.)  BIBLIO  prompts for each field as for the Insert and

               Append commands.  (See sections 4.4 and 4.5.)  If  no  field

               four fields.  Each field begins with a decimal  point.   The

               decimal  point  is followed by the code for the field.  (See

               section 4.9.) This code preceeds a  colon  which,  in  turn,

               preceeds the field string.

               5.2  Editing Precautions


               The user may edit a BIBLIO data file with any editor, but he

               must take the following precautions:



                  1. If using a line-oriented editor, line-numbers must  be

                  stripped before exiting.


                  2. Page-marks (formfeeds) must  not  be  stripped  except

                  when  an  entire  page is deleted.  In this special case,

                  the page mark at the end of the deleted page must also be

                  deleted.


                  3. Data files should  be  printed  only  when  absolutely

                  necessary  to avoid wasting paper as a result of the many

                  form feeds in the file.  If the user wants a  listing  of

                  all  entries in the file, he should use the Dump command.

                  (See section 4.11.)


                  4. A file whose extension is .DAT must  be  printed  with

                  the following command string:


                       .PRINT <filename>.DAT/FILE:ASCII(CR)                       _



                  to avoid carriage-control functions.
