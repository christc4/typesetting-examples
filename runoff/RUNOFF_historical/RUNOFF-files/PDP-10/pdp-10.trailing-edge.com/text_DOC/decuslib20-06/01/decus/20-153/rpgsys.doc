			RPG PROGRAM GENERATOR


.R RPGSYS

TERMINAL TYPE =  D
	Enter A for ADDS 580, D for Datamedia 1520A, V for VT52,
	3 for Data Point 3300, B for Beehive 100, or E to end the program.
PROGRAM =  SAMPLE
	Enter name of program without extension.  It will automatically
	  be given an RPG extension.
	When finished, enter /E for end.

RESET LINE NUMBERS?  YES
	This will be asked only if the program entered already exists.
	  If you enter /E the program will end.
	  If you enter YES:  the line numbers will be made to start with
	  010 for each form; each succeeding lines will be incremented
	  by 10.  If you enter NO:  line numbers will remain the same,
	  however the program will check to see if there are at least
	  five records where the page and line numbers are missing. If
	  the page and line numbers are missing the terminal will display
	    AT LEAST FIVE MISSING PAGE AND LINE NUMBERS
	    YOU SHOULD RESET THE LINE NUMBERS
	  and the program will return control to the question
	    RESET LINE NUMBERS?

ACTION =  ADD
	Enter ADD, CHG, DEL or /E(End).

FORM =  H
	Enter H(Control Card), F(File Description), E(Extension), L(Line
	  Counter), I(Input), C(Calculations), O(Output), /A(Action),
	  /E(End).

PAGE =  01
	Enter value where 0 < page < 100, /F(Form), /A(Action) or
	  /E(End).

LINE =  010
	Enter value where 0 < line < 1000, /P(Page), /F(Form),
	  /A(Action) or /E(End).

	NOTE:  ^C will NOT be effective while running RPGSYS.






















	On the following pages, each form under the ADD option will be
	  explained.
	  
	If CHG was entered for ACTION, whichever form is entered will
	  be displayed as in the ADD option with the exception that the
	  existing info will also be displayed.  If there are two sides
	  for that form, enter which side should be displayed.  Near the
	  bottom of the screen enter the element number to be changed.
	  The curser will position itself on that line between the brackets.
	  Enter the correct info, hit return and the curser will be in
	  position to accept the next element number to be changed.  When
	  all elements are correct enter END; if it asks for which side,
	  enter the number of the side to be changed next--if finished,
	  enter END.   If the line to be changed is a comment, the old
	  comment will be displayed.  Then the new comment will be asked
	  for--just as in the ADD option.

	If DEL was entered for ACTION, whichever form, page, and
	  line number is entered is the line that will be deleted.

	Whenever you are finished adding, changing or deleting, enter
	  /A instead of a line number.  A new action can then be entered.
	  If you just want to change or delete on a different form enter
	  /F; for a different page, enter /P.
