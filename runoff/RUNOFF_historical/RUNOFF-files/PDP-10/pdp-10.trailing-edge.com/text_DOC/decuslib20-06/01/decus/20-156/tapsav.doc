     1.0  INTRODUCTION

          TAPSAV is a magnetic tape manipulation program which allows
     the quick and convenient storage of disk files on tape.  When you
     have many files to store and either don't need them on disk or
     don't have room for them, TAPSAV will let you put them onto a
     private tape and retrieve them whenever you wish.  TAPSAV was
     designed to avoid the problems associated with standard DEC tape
     utilities, which aren't designed for small scale, single user
     tape work.

          TAPSAV provides the following features:

      o  A tape directory maintained solely on disk, which allows the
         following actions to be performed without accessing the tape:

          o  Deletion of files.

          o  Un-deletion of files.

          o  Quick and complete wild-card searches of the tape
             contents.

          o  Modification of the tape title.


      o  Adding files to the tape and automatically deleting old
         copies.

      o  Rebuilding the directory from scratch if the disk copy is
         lost.

      o  Saveset structure to allow restoration of classes of files.

      o  Files on tape are not directory-specific, and may be saved or
         restored to or from anywhere.

     2.0  TAPSAV OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

          TAPSAV makes the following assumptions when it is started:

          Tape directories are to be read and written from logical
     device TSDIR:, which should be defined as a directory.  A
     LOGIN.CMD or COMAND.CMD file is a logical place for this.  If
     TAPSAV is unable to find a device TSDIR:, you will be warned that
     you need to add a line like the following to your LOGIN.CMD file:

          DEFINE TSDIR:  PS:<PSYC.J-STUDENT>

          All tape directories will be stored as files in this area,
     and will be of the form VOLID.TAPEDIR, where VOLID is the volume
     identifier of your tape.  An example of a tape directory file
     would be, using the above TSDIR:  definition:

          PS:<PSYC.J-STUDENT>U12889.TAPEDIR.1.

          Tape directory files are never saved onto a TAPSAV tape.

          Tapes are mounted with the logical name TS:.  If TAPSAV
     finds such a device upon startup, it prints out the tape volume
     name and identifying banner.  If your tape has been mounted with
     some other name, you must tell TAPSAV what device name has been
     used with the TAPE command (below).

          An example of a mount command for a TAPSAV tape might be:

          @MOUNT TAPE TS:/VOLID:U12889/WRITE

          If not specified, the default directory for saving and
     restoring files is the user's connected directory.

     3.0  TAPSAV COMMANDS

          The following is a list of TAPSAV commands and their
     actions:

      o  CREATE (a new TAPSAV tape)
         This command creates a directory for the tape you have
         mounted as device TS:.  If a directory already exists for
         this tape, you will be warned that the CREATE command will
         wipe out the old tape contents, and be given a chance to
         change your mind.  The CREATE command must always be done for
         a new tape, or when rebuilding a tape from scratch.

      o  DELETE (specified file(s) from tape)
         This command sets deleted status for a specified group of
         files.  For information on how the files are specified,
         please see the following section.

      o  DIRECTORY (of tape to file) FILESPEC (for wildcard files)
         WILDSPEC
         Creates a directory listing in the file specified.  If no
         filespec is given, the directory is printed on the terminal.
         Usual mode of use is DIR<cr> or DIR DSK:TAPE.DIR<cr>.

              For information on partial directories of special types
         of files only, please see section 3.4.

      o  EXIT (from TAPSAV)
         Returns you to EXEC command level, leaving TAPSAV.

      o  FAKETAPE (tape id:) VOLID
         This command is used to fool the program into thinking a
         certain tape is mounted, so that you can check out
         directories without having to mount the tape.  VOLID is the
         volume identifier of the tape.

      o  LIST (filenames on save or restore)
         Causes the program to tell you what file transfers are in
         progress.  This is the default mode.

      o  HELP (with program commands)
         Gives a short summary of commands.

      o  NOLIST (of filenames on save or restore)
         Causes the program to omit listing files on a save or
         restore.

      o  REBUILD (the tape directory)
         Rebuilds the tape directory from scratch if it has been
         damaged or deleted.

      o  RESTORE (specified file(s) to disk area:) DIRECTORY
         Restores a list of files from tape to the specifed place.  If
         no directory is specified, files are sent to user's connected
         directory.
    TAPSAV - A file storage utility for magnetic tapes          Page 5


      o  SAVE (specified files into saveset:) SAVESET NAME
         Saves a group of files on tape, putting them all into the
         same saveset.  If not specified, the saveset name used is
         GENERAL.  Maximum length name is fifteen characters.

      o  SDIRECT (of tape to file) FILESPEC
         Like the DIRECTORY command, except that it includes deleted
         files in the listing.

      o  SUPERSEDE (files on tape when:)
         The subcommands which follow specify when files on tape
         should be superseded by files on disk with the same
         filenames:

          o  Across - supersede files across saveset boundries.

          o  Always - always supersede tape files.

          o  Never - never supersede tape files.

          o  Older - supersede tape files when older than disk files.
             (This is the default)


      o  TAPE (device name) NAME:
         Specifies what device name is used for the magtape drive.
         TAPSAV will create the logical name TS:  and assign it to
         that drive.  This command is not needed if you mount the tape
         as TS:  in the first place.

      o  TITLE (for the tape)
         Gives you the opportunity to change the tape title, an
         80-character string used to identify the tape in any manner
         you choose.

      o  UNDELETE (specified file(s) from tape)
         Removes the deleted status from a group of files.

     3.1  Specifying Groups Of Files On A DELETE, RESTORE Or UNDELETE

          Following one of the commands above, you will enter the file
     specification mode, where the prompt changes from TAPSAV-- to
     File--.  This indicates that you may type a file specification,
     which may be a single file or a wildcard specification which may
     cover a whole group of files.  One separate file specification is
     allowed per line, and the File-- prompt is repeated until you
     signify end of list with a (CR).

          Files may also be selected by their numbers from a directory
     listing.  A single number or a number range (6:10) may be typed
     in place of a filename.

          Following each specification, the program will indicate how
     many files in the directory matched by typing out [ "n" found],
     where "n" is a number.  Here is an example:

                     TAPSAV--RESTORE
                       File--ALPHA.MAC
                             [1 found]
                       File--XYZ.ONE
                             [0 found]
                       File--*.RNO
                             [16 found]
                       File--6:10
                             [5 found]
                       File--(CR)

                     [ Starting transfer to disk... ]

                     TAPSAV--EXIT
                     @


          Recognition is not available on these files.  The same files
     may  be  selected  by different commands due to wildcard overlap,
     but each file will only be restored once.

          In case you mistakenly specified too many files or the wrong
     files,  there  are  two  ways  to  abort a restore after you have
     started it.  The first is  to  type  ^C.   This  will  abort  the
     program  and you must start again from scratch.  The second is to
     type ^E.  This will temporarily stop the restore.  You must  then
     specify  one  of  four options.  The ^E abort and its options are
     discussed later in section 3.5.



     3.2  Specifying Groups Of Files On A SAVE

          Following a SAVE command, you will again get the File--
     prompt, but it will work a bit differently.  Since you are now
     specifying files on disk rather than in the tape directory,
     recognition is available to complete file names.  If any
    TAPSAV - A file storage utility for magnetic tapes          Page 7


     particular file or file group is not valid for some reason, you
     are notified with an error message and the file is ignored, but
     you are still in file listing mode.  When saving, you are not
     notified of the number of matches, since it could be a
     potentially very large number.  (EG File--PS:<*>*.*.*)

          When a file is saved, other versions of the file on tape are
     automatically deleted.  The generation number of a file is not
     preserved on tape, so when a file is restored it automatically
     takes the first appropriate generation number for a particular
     directory.

          When working with a large number of files, you should be
     aware that if the end of tape reflector is encountered on a save,
     the monitor will automatically cause the next tape volume to be
     mounted and will continue the save on the next tape.  This is OK
     if you have specified multiple volumes in your mount request, but
     if you have not the monitor will request a "SCRATCH" tape to be
     mounted.

          Your job will freeze until the operator asks you what tape
     to use for the continuation.  In most cases you will wish to use
     ^C to abort your job, and you will have safely saved all of the
     files that had an [OK] after them when they were listed during
     transfer.  You may then dismount your tape, and put any remaining
     files onto a new tape.  This is generally more convenient then
     continuing onto a second tape.  Unfortunately, it is not possible
     for the program to warn you automatically when the tape end is
     encountered, so operator intervention is generally required.



     3.3  Retrieving Files By Saveset Name

          Saveset names are maintained on the tape as 1-15 character
     strings.  If you wish to retrieve a specified type of file from
     only one saveset, and ignore the file type in other savesets, you
     can use the /Saveset:  switch at the end of the filespec given to
     the File-- prompt.  When no saveset name is given, all are
     searched.  Here are some examples:

             TAPSAV--RESTORE
               File--*.MAC/Saveset:SOURCES
                     [ 6 found ]
               File--*.*/Saveset:DATA-FILES
                     [ 12 found]
               File--(CR)


          The first command will retrieve all .MAC files found in  the
     SOURCES saveset, and ignore all others.  The second will retrieve
     all files in the DATA-FILES saveset.
    TAPSAV - A file storage utility for magnetic tapes          Page 8


     3.4  Partial Directories

          By using the full format of the directory command, you may
     get a directory of only specific files on a tape.  The command
     is:

          DIRECTORY (of tape to file) TTY:  (of wildcard files) *.PAS

          In the above example, only files of type .PAS would be
     listed in the directory to the terminal.  Any wildcard formation
     may be used (ALPHA.*, *.Q??, *.*).  A saveset name may also be
     tacked on to restrict files to that saveset only, for example
     *.MAC/SAVESET:Alpha.  This would list only the *.MAC files in the
     Alpha saveset and ignore all others.

          As with the normal directory command, you may route the
     output listing to a file by substituting the name in place of the
     default TTY:  field.



     3.5  Interrupt Commands

          The following control characters may be used to interrupt
     TAPSAV while it is processing a tape:

      o  ^A -- Print filename of last file seen while tape positioning
         is in progress.  May be used during a save or restore to list
         the last file seen.  This is usually useful only when in
         NOLIST mode.

      o  ^E -- Interrupt a SAVE or RESTORE to accept a further
         command.  This command may be used to change between LIST and
         NOLIST mode while running.  The ^E interrupt may also be used
         to ABORT the present restore operation, and to RESUME the
         restore as if no interrupt command had been typed.




     4.0  SPEEDING UP TAPE USAGE

          There are several ways in which you may use TAPSAV
     efficiently.  First, it pays to keep tapes down to a managable
     size.  Rather than fill up a tape, you should use several
     different tapes to keep each one half filled or less.

          As you keep using a tape, you are likely to save newer
     versions of files, replacing the older ones.  Any files
     superseded in this manner remain on the tape, taking up space
     with DELETED status set.  Thus each successive save and restore
     takes longer, as more and more tape must be passed over on the
     way to the current end of the tape.
    TAPSAV - A file storage utility for magnetic tapes          Page 9


          In some cases, you may wish to retain your deleted files, as
     a way of archiving old program versions.  If you wish to discard
     deleted files, however, you may follow this procedure:

     1.  Get a SDIRECT (super-directory) listing of the tape to
         examine all deleted files.

     2.  UNDELETE any files that you wish to retain.

     3.  RESTORE files *.* to a disk area, preferably empty.

     4.  CREATE the tape again.  Reply YES when TAPSAV asks if you
         really wish to overwrite the old directory.  This leaves you
         with a logically empty tape.

     5.  SAVE files *.* from the area you dumped them into.


          This procedure effectively removes all deleted files from
     the tape, leaving only active files.  To determine if this
     procedure is necessary, you can get a DIRECTORY of the tape and
     look at the total number of pages at the bottom.  Then do an
     SDIRECT command and look at the total number of pages including
     the deleted files.  If the second number is much greater than the
     first, you probably wish to rebuild the tape.



     5.0  IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

          All tape I/O in TAPSAV is done in buffered mode.  While
     somewhat slower than asyncronous dump mode I/O, it is simpler to
     use and error correction is easier.  The tape format was designed
     to be as simple as possible, to facilitate restoration of files
     if the tape becomes damaged and a software specialist has to
     tackle it by hand.  All tape records are 14 pages long for
     efficient tape packing, and each file occupies one file on tape.
     The first 40 words of the first record of each file contains the
     file header information, which is what TAPSAV uses to reconstruct
     the tape if the directory is damaged.  The number of the file in
     the directory is the position of the file on the tape, there is
     no header file on the tape itself.

          TAPSAV checks the file creation date when in "supersede
     older" mode.  When a file is restored from tape to disk, the
     creation and last write dates are set to reflect their values
     when the file was saved.
