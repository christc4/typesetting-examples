           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-10  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-10  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 10B of ALGOL-10

            Version 2 of APLSF-10

            Version 12C of COBOL-10

            Version 5A of DBMS-10

            Version 11 of FORTRAN-10

            Version 7.04 of GALAXY-10

            Version 4 of IBMCOM/ET-10

            Version 1 of IBMCOM/HASP-10

            Version 11 of MS-10

            Version 4D of SORT-10

            Version 7.04 of TOPS-10 Utilities
                                                                  Page 2


     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.



     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  DSKP:,  we
     recommend  that  you make an entry in your login procedures so that
     DSKP:  is assigned to be the structure you will be using.   If  you
     do  this  and  use the default [7,6] ppn, you will not need to edit
     the BACKUP retrieval command files provided to set-up  the  product
     distribution directories and to process the patch tape.

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  BACKUP  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed  in  [2,5]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following files should be installed in the disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP101.PDF
                UPDATE.EXE

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also contains indirect command  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These BACKUP CCL files are intended to be run  interactively.   See
     the last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-10-V2  product  you
     would install
                                                                  Page 3

                APL1S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL1S2.CCL      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.

     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-10-V10B  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D608D-SB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5069D-SB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   ALGOL-10
     distribution directory.
        
        From save set ALGOL-SOURCES
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
                                                                  Page 5


     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ALG].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ALG] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ALG10B.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 6


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  APLSF-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                APLSF.EXE
                GENSF.EXE
                TENTAP.EXE

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  APLSF-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D476E-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5065E-BB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   APLSF-10
     distribution directory.
        
           From save set "REL LIBRARY"  

                APLS12.REL
                APLG12.REL
                APLW12.REL
                APLS12.LNK
                APLG12.LNK
                APLW12.LNK

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,APL].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,APL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:APL1S2.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING COBOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  COBOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                for Cobol-74    for 68 to 74 translation tool

     COBDDT.REL CBL74.EXE       68274.EXE
     CPYLIB.EXE CBL74C.EXE *    68274C.EXE *
     ISAM.EXE   CBL74D.EXE *    68274D.EXE *
     LIBARY.EXE CBL74E.EXE *    68274E.EXE *

                C74LIB.REL
                C74O12.EXE

        * only if using the multi-segmented compiler (ONESEG==0)

     The COBOL V12C product may be patched via source file updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files
     from the COBOL-10 V12C distribution tape BB-H580E-SB into the  disk
     directory you have set up as the COBOL-10 distribution directory.
     COBDDT.KEY CBL74.KEY       68274.KEY
     CPYLIB.KEY CBL74C.KEY      68274C.KEY  
     ISAM.KEY   CBL74D.KEY      68274D.KEY

                C74LIB.KEY
                C74O12.KEY


     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  COBOL  product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.
                                                                  Page 8


     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  COBOL-10
     distribution  tape BB-H580E-SB into the disk directory you have set
     up as the COBOL-10 distribution directory.

     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CBL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
     To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBL12C.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBR12C.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        
     Use of any of these files will also restore the SORT files  on  the
     COBOL  tape  to  the DSKP:[7,6,SRT] area.  Also the following files
     are restored by these CCL files but not used by Autopatch:

        CRELD.MAC       GETERA.MAC      SETEOF.MAC      SRTTAB.MAC
        STRNGL.MAC

     If you will be Autopatching BOTH Cobol-74 and the 68274 Translation
     Tool  new files are required in the patching directory.  Obtain the
     COBASM.MAC file and make a copy named C74ASM.MAC.  You must  create
     a  copy  of  the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set on and
     call it TRNASM.MAC.  For more information refer to section  6.0  of
     the COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12C distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     When SELECTing COBOL with PEP you will be asked if  you  are  using
     the  multi-seg  compiler.  Unless you have set the ONESEG switch on
     in the COBASM.MAC file the correct answer is YES.  In order to have
     Autopatch  include  the  SORT  module in the OTS you must create an
     empty file named CBLSRT.FLG in the patching directory  (PAT:).   If
     the   process  can  find  CBLSRT.REL  it  will  then  be  included.
     Likewise, in order to have Autopatch include support  for  DBMS  in
     the  OTS  you  must  create  an  empty file named CBLDBM.FLG in the
     patching directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
                                                                 Page 10

     3.4  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                FORDML.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DAEMDB.EXE

     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  DBMS-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D478D-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-C804D-BB(800 BPI)
     into the disk directory you have set up as the DBMS-10 distribution
     directory.

     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,DBM].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,DBM] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DBMV5A.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will

     3.5  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING FORTRAN-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-10   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
        FORTRA.EXE      SINGLE.EXE      FORTB.EXE       FORTC.EXE
        FORTD.EXE       FORTE.EXE       FORTF.EXE       FORTG.EXE
        DORTRA.EXE      DORTB.EXE       DOTRC.EXE       DORTD.EXE
        DORTE.EXE       DORTF.EXE       DORTG.EXE       FORO11.EXE
        FORLIB.REL      FORDDT.REL

     The FORTRAN V11 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-10 V11 distribution  tape  BB-D480G-SB  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-10 distribution
     directory.

        From the save set "FORTRAN-AUTOPATCH"   
        FORTRA.KEY      SINGLE.KEY      FORTB.KEY       FORTC.KEY
        FORTD.KEY       FORTE.KEY       FORTF.KEY       FORTG.KEY
        DORTRA.KEY      DORTB.KEY       DOTRC.KEY       DORTD.KEY
        DORTE.KEY       DORTF.KEY       DORTG.KEY       FORO11.KEY
        FORLIB.KEY      FORDDT.KEY

     If you  are  also  using  DBMS  with  FORTRAN  you  will  need  the
     FORDBM.REL  file  from  the  fourth  save-set  of  the  FORTRAN v11
     distribution tape and the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second  save-set
     of the Autopatch tape.

     If  you  desire  to  Autopatch  FORTRAN  via  updated  sources  the
     following  files  are  required to build the FORTRAN product.  They
     must  be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),   the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV
        RMSINT.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  FORTRAN-10
                                                                 Page 14

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,FTN].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,FTN] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN111.CCL[7,6]

     If you use DBMS with FORTRAN and want to have the  Autopatch  Patch
     and  Build Control file build DBMSF you must create a dummy file in
     the patching directory (PAT:) called FTNDBM.FLG.  The  presence  of
     this  file  on PAT:  will cause the BATCH control file to branch in
     order to perform the processing required to build  DBMSF.EXE.   You
     will  also need the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second save-set of the
     Autopatch tape.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a BACKUP command  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for more information.

     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING GALAXY-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for GALAXY-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:

     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING IBMCOM-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for IBMCOM-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
                                        HASP only

     3.9  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  SORT-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SORT.EXE
                FSORT.EXE

     The following files are required to build the SORT  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  SORT-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D489F-SB  or  from the COBOL-10 distribution
     tape into the disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as  the  SORT-10
     distribution directory.

        SRTUUO.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,SRT].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,SRT] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:SRTV4D.CCL[7,6]
        
     This command file is valid for use  ONLY  with  the  separate  SORT
     distribution  tape.   Use  of the COBOL CCL file will load the SORT
     files from the COBOL distribution tape into DSKP:[7,6,SRT].
                                                                 Page 24

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CSP].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CSP] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.

     An indirect command file which restores  all  autopatched  products
     from the CUSP tape has also been provided.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CSP704.CCL[7,6]
        

     The following files are required to build  the  UTILITIES  product.
     They  must  be  available  either  in the patching area (PAT:), the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape
                                                                 Page 27



        B361LB.REL      OPRPAR.REL

     These file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you  use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     When selecting the UTILITIES-10 product for Autopatching you should
     include  the  DIS:  for MONITOR as part of your path definition for
     DIS:     for    the    UTILITIES-10    product.     For    example,
     DSKP:[7,6,CSP],DSKP:[7,6,MON].

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
