HELP			;ENTRIES HAVE THE FORM
<TERMINATOR><IDENTIFIER><TAB><TEXT><TERMINATOR>

<TERMINATOR> IS CURRENTLY CONTROL-A
<IDENTIFIER> IS "HEADER" FOR THE F.MAC FILE HEADER, INCLUDING
DEFINITIONS OF XP MACRO, ETC.

<IDENTIFIER> IS "HELP" FOR THIS SECTION.

<IDENTIFIER> IS FTXXXX(SYSTEM,SYSTEM,...) TO SPECIFIY A FEATURE TEST SWITCH.
EACH SYSTEM FOR WHICH THE SWITCH IS TO BE ON AS THE DEFAULT IS LISTED
IN THE PARENTHESES FOLLOWING THE SWITCH NAME, I.E. 1040,1050,...,1070,...
FOR EXAMPLE, FTSWITCH(1050,1055)

<TAB> NOTES THE END OF THE IDENTIFIER.

<TEXT> IS ANY ASCII STRING UP TO THE NEXT TERMINATOR AND IS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE IDENTIFIER. IT WILL BE USED APPROPRIATELY BY MONGEN.

THE FGEN DIALOGUE IN MONGEN FIRST ASKS WHAT TYPE OF SYSTEM IS BEING BUILT
AND THEN SCANS FGEN.HLP AND BUILDS A TABLE OF SWITCHES AND THEIR DEFAULT VALUES.
THE TEXT MAY BE USED IN EXPLAIN MODE TO EXPLAIN THE USAGE OF FEATURE TEST
SWITCHES, AND IS INCLUDED AS COMMENTS IN THE RESULTING F.MAC OUTPUT FILE.

FGEN.HLP IS READ FROM THE SAME DIRECTORY FROM WHICH MONGEN WAS RUN. IF NO
SUCH FILE EXISTS, DEVICE SYS: IS USED. IF NO SUCH FILE EXISTS, FGEN
HAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT FEATURE TEST SWITCHES.

;This universal file is assembled before each MONITOR module.  This file
; must be assembled before any MONITOR modules are assembled, however,
; it need be assembled only once regardless of the number of MONITOR
; modules which follow.  Example:
;
;  .COMPILE F.MAC/COMPILE,S.MAC/COMPILE,FILIO,FILFND,FILUUO,SCNSER
;
;The files F.REL and S.REL are not needed and may be discarded.


;List of independent MONITOR COMMAND features
;These features can be eliminated from a system by
;setting the appropriate FTXXXX symbol below to 0
; and reassembling those routines in which code for the
; feature appears.  The routines affected by each feature
; are listed below.  To guarantee that no routines are
; missed, FTXXXX is defined to be an INTERNAL in those routines
; in which it is used in conditional assembly.  Thus LINK
; will detect multiple defined GLOBALS if not
; all routines affected have been reassembled.
