 The TDISMOUNT command will

 1.  dismount all magnetic tapes and/or floppy disks you have mounted on
     any tape/floppy drive, and then

 2.  deallocate all tape/floppy drives you have allocated.

 You may abbreviate this command to two letters (TD).

 TDISMOUNT is the companion to the TMOUNT command.
