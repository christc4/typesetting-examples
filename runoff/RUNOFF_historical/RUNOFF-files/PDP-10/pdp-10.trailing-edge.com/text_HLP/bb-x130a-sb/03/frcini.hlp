FRCINI is a program to force INITIA to run on non-network lines. It was
specifically  created  to solve the problem of RSX20F lines not getting
their speeds set correctly when the system is brought up with a startup
option that prevents INITIA from running. To run it type:

	.RUN FRCINI

It  will  verify  that  it  has  run  correctly by typing the following
message:

Forced INITIA to run on all non network lines.
Type .INITIA on the CTY to start the system.
