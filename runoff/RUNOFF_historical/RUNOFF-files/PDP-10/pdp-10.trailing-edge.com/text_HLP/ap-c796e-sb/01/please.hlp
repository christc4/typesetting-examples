PLEASE is a convenient way to communicate with the operator.  Just  type
the monitor command PLEASE followed by your question on the same line:
     .PLEASE   I HAVE A PROBLEM
and wait for the operator to respond.  The two of  you  can  communicate
back  and forth a line at a time, in other words, after each question or
comment you must depress the carriage return  key.   When  you  wish  to
terminate  the  dialogue  (or  if  you  wish  to  give up waiting if the
operator is busy), depress the ESCape or ALTmode key.  The  same  effect
can be achieved by enterring a control-C or control-Z.
