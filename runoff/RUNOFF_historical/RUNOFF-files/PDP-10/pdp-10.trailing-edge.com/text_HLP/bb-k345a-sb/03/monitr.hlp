MONITR is a program to print information about  the  running  monitor.
At  present  it  prints  the monitor name, build date, version number,
load date/time, uptime, and  the  file  from  which  the  monitor  was
loaded.  It was originally intended to make it easy for DEC developers
to find out what monitor was being run at a field test site.

MONITR may be run as follow:

     .RUN MONITR

MONITR then does the necessary  GETTABs  and  prints  the  information
described above
