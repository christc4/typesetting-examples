      The GRIPE program is used to send a message to whoever it is that
handles complaints about the system's workings.  This list is reflected
in the logical name GRIPE-LIST:.  To run GRIPE:

	@GRIPE		or	@RUN SYS:GRIPE

You will be prompted for the subject and text of the message.     It is
possible to edit the text with rubout,  ctrl-U,  ctrl-W,  or to enter a
text editor, or to include a file in the text.  Terminate the text with
either an ESC or a ctrl-Z.
