     The LOKPGS program counts the number of pages of memory which have
been locked in core at a given instant.  These include the pages of the
resident monitor code, resident monitor data, and pages locked for I/O,
index tables, or other less common cases (such as PLOCK).
The format of the command is:

	lokpgs [/h]

and the output looks like:

	629. locked pages counted on system.

Using the /h switch results in typing this text.
