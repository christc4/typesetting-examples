
CTRL/S

When you type CTRL/S (control-S), the monitor  holds  output  to  your
terminal.   This control character works only after you have typed the
SET TTY PAGE command.  This control character is useful if you have  a
display terminal, and you have to stop the output to read it.  To read
the rest of the output, type CTRL/Q.
