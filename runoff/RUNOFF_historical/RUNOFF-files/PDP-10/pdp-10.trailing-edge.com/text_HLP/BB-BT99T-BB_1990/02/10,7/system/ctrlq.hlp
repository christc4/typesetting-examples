
CTRL/Q

When you type CTRL/Q (control-Q), the monitor resumes output  to  your
terminal.   CTRL/S  and CTRL/Q are useful when you are using a display
terminal.  Used in conjunction with CTRL/S, you can stop and  continue
output  to  your  terminal,  thus reading a file before it scrolls off
your display screen.
