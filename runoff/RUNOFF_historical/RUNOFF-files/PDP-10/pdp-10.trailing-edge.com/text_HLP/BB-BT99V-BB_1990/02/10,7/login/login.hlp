
LOGIN Command

Function

     You use the LOGIN command to gain  access  to  the  system.   The
     LOGIN command runs the LOGIN program.  LOGIN accepts:

      o  your project-programmer number (PPN) or your user name

      o  your password

      o  optional account and remark strings

     You can obtain these from your system administrator.   LOGIN  can
     accept a path specification (directory name) in place of the PPN.

     To log in, type the  LOGIN  command,  and  press  RETURN.   LOGIN
     prompts  you with a pound sign (#).  Type your project-programmer
     number or your user name, and press RETURN.  You  can  also  type
     your  project-programmer  number  or  your  user name immediately
     after typing LOGIN, followed by a space.  After it receives  this
     information,  LOGIN  prints  another  prompt  (PASSWORD:) on your
     terminal.  Type your password, and press  RETURN.   The  password
     does not echo on your terminal.  You are finished logging in when
     the monitor prompt (a period) is returned.

     Your system may be running account validation software.  In  this
     case, LOGIN may not be complete after you type your password.  If
     your job requires an account string, LOGIN prompts you  for  your
     account  (ACCOUNT:).   Type  your  account string, and then press
     RETURN, or just press RETURN  if  the  system  administrator  has
     established a default account for your job.  If your job requires
     a remark string, LOGIN prompts for it (REMARK:).   Here  you  can
     type anything that will identify your job.  Your remark can be up
     to 39 characters.  If you do not have  a  remark,  press  RETURN.
     The  system  records spaces for your remark.  Example 3 shows the
     procedure for logging in with account validation software.

                                   NOTE

             When the account string is validated,  characters
             are  checked  according  to case.  Therefore, you
             must  type  your  account  in   the   same   case
             (uppercase or lowercase) as it is required.  This
             aspect of the system can be changed by the system
             administrator.

     You can put your account string and  remark  in  your  SWITCH.INI
     file.   For  more  information about the SWITCH.INI file, see the
     help file SWINI.

     To  specify  a  default  path  for  disk  I/O,  type   the   path
     specification  instead of your project-programmer number.  A path
     specification more specifically identifies your  directory  area.
     It   specifies   either  a  user-file  directory  or  a  sub-file
     directory.  For more information about directory paths,  see  the
     help file DIRPAT.

     If you have detached your terminal from a job, and begin  to  log
     in  to  another job, the LOGIN program asks if you want to attach
     to the old job or  create  a  new  job.   For  information  about
     detaching and attaching jobs, see the ATTACH and DETACH commands.
     Example 2 shows the procedure for logging in to a new  job  after
     detaching the first.

Format

     LOGIN identification/switches

     Where:    identification       represents       either       your
               project-programmer  number  (PPN),  path  specification
               ([directory]), or your user name.

     You can type a path specification in place of  the  PPN  or  user
     name.   This allows you to establish a default directory path for
     the job.  The path specification is either a user-file  directory
     or  a  sub-file  directory.   Directory  paths  are  enclosed  in
     brackets (for example:  [27,5434,SFD]).

     The following switches modify the command string.  These switches
     can be included in your SWITCH.INI file.

     Most parameters set by these switches can be changed  by  monitor
     commands  after  you  log in.  For more information see the <SET>
     commands help files and the SETSRC  program  description  in  the
     TOPS-10 User Utilities Manual.

          Switch                           Function

     /ACCOUNT:"string"   Specifies the account string  for  your  job.
                         If    the   account   string   contains   any
                         nonalphanumeric characters, you must  enclose
                         the  string  in quotation marks.  This switch
                         is often included in a SWITCH.INI file.

     /ASSIGN:            Assigns a  device to  your job and  a logical
     (dev1:log1,         name to the device.
     dev2:log2...)
                              dev:  is the device name
                              log   is the logical name

                         For more information about device names,  see
                         the help file DEVNAM.

                         The logical name is  optional.   This  switch
                         can  be  used  more  than once to assign more
                         than one device.

     /ATTACH:argument    Sets the ATTACH state for  the  LOGIN  dialog
                         and  the  job  being created.  /ATTACH:ASK is
                         the  default  action.   By  default,   if   a
                         detached  job  exists with the specified PPN,
                         and the job was logged in  with  /ATTACH:ASK,
                         LOGIN  asks whether you want to attach to the
                         detached job, instead of creating a  new  job
                         with the same PPN.  The /ATTACH:IGNORE switch
                         suppresses  the   default   action   of   the
                         /ATTACH:ASK switch.  Jobs you create with the
                         IGNORE argument will be ignored by LOGIN when
                         you  do  additional logins with the same PPN.
                         LOGIN will not ask you if you want to  attach
                         to jobs set to the IGNORE argument.

     /BATCH:             Sets the  batch parameters  (used  by  BATCON
                         only).
     (arg:n, arg:n)      Multiple keywords can be given to the  /BATCH
                         switch;  in  that case, they must be enclosed
                         in parentheses  and  separated  with  commas.
                         Arguments and their meanings are as follows:

                         Argument                  Meaning

                         INTERVENTION   Specifies  whether  the  batch
                                        job  requires  operator
                         NOINTERVENTION intervention to run.

                         NAME:"name"    Sets the  batch  job  name  to
                                        "name".

                         SEQUENCE:n     Sets the batch sequence number
                                        to "n".

                         STREAM:n       Sets the batch  stream  number
                                        to "n".

                         REQUESTID:n    Sets the batch request  number
                                        to "n".

     /CORE:nx            Informs the system of the maximum  amount  of
                         core memory that your job can use.  The value
                         for x must be either P or  K.   P  represents
                         pages  of  memory (each page is equivalent to
                         512  words);  K  represents  blocks  of  1024
                         words.   The  value  n is any decimal number.
                         Refer  to  the  CORE  command   for   further
                         information.

     /DEFAULT:           Specifies  job   characteristics.    Multiple
     (arg:n, arg:n)      keywords can be given to the /DEFAULT switch;
                         in  that  case,  they  must  be  enclosed  in
                         parentheses  and   separated   with   commas.
                         Arguments and their meanings are as follows:

                         Argument                  Meaning

                         BIGBUF:n       Sets the default BIGBUF buffer
                                        size  for  disk  to  n blocks.
                                        For information on how to  set
                                        the   default   BIGBUF  buffer
                                        size, see the <SET> command.

                         BUFFERS:n      Sets  the  default  number  of
                                        disk   buffers   to   n.   For
                                        information on how to set  the
                                        default  buffer  size, see the
                                        <SET> command.

                         PROTECTION:n   Sets    the    default    file
                                        protection  for your job to n.
                                        For information on how to  set
                                        default  file  protection, see
                                        the <SET> command.

     /DEFER              Defers queueing of spooled output  until  you
                         log out.

     /DSKFUL:arg         Sets the action to be performed if  your  job
                         exceeds  the  disk  area  allowed to it.  The
                         arguments  are  ERROR  and  PAUSE.   If   the
                         argument  is  ERROR,  an  error  condition is
                         passed to your job.  This usually  terminates
                         the  program.   If the argument is PAUSE, the
                         program  is  suspended,  and  your   job   is
                         returned  to  monitor level.  This allows you
                         to  request  operator  assistance  and   then
                         continue the job, as long as you do not issue
                         any commands that destroy  your  core  image.
                         For information see the <SET> command.

     /DSKPRI:n           Allows privileged users to set  the  priority
                         for   their   job's   disk  operations  (data
                         transfers and head positionings).  The  value
                         can   range  from  -3  to  +3.   The  default
                         timesharing priority is 0.   For  information
                         see the <SET> command.

     /GUIDELINE          Specifies that the numeric value cited in the
                         /PHYSICAL switch is a guideline.  This is the
                         default setting for /PHYSICAL.

     /HELP:keyword       Prints HELP text  on  your  terminal.   Valid
                         keywords are:  ARGUMENTS, SWITCHES, and TEXT.
                         The ARGUMENTS keyword prints out  a  list  of
                         valid   switches   and  arguments.   SWITCHES
                         displays only a list of switches.  TEXT  will
                         print  the entire HELP text.  TEXT is assumed
                         if no keyword  is  supplied.   /HELP  may  be
                         abbreviated to /H.

     /LIB:[ppn]          Sets the library area (LIB:) to the specified
                         PPN.

     /LIMIT              Specifies that the numeric value specified in
                         the /PHYSICAL switch is a limit rather than a
                         guideline.  If  /LIMIT  is  not  issued,  the
                         system  assumes  that the numeric value given
                         for the /PHYSICAL switch is a guideline.

     /LOCATE:node        Sets the job location to the specified  octal
                         ANF  node  number.   For  information see the
                         help file for the LOCATE command.

     /MAILCHECK          Checks the file DSK:MAIL.TXT to  see  if  you
                         have  mail from the MS mail system.  You must
                         have DECMAIL/MS on your  system.   /MAILCHECK
                         is the default action.

     /NAME:"name"        Associates the given   name  with  your  job.
                         This  name  will  appear on output, listings,
                         and  on  other  information  output  by   the
                         system.   Enclose the name in quotation marks
                         if it contains non-alphanumeric characters.

     /NEW                /NEW causes NEW:([1,5]) to be searched before
                         SYS:([1,4])  whenever  SYS:   is specified or
                         implied.  If the files are not on NEW:,  SYS:
                         will   be  searched.   For  more  information
                         libraries, see the help file LIBS.

     /NODEFER            Does not defer queued  output  until  logout.
                         Refer  to the SET DEFER command.  This is the
                         default.

     /NOMAILCHECK        Suppresses checking the file DSK:MAIL.TXT  to
                         see if you have mail from the MS mail system.

     /NONEW              Removes the [1,5] directory (NEW:) from  your
                         SYS:   specification.   This  is  the default
                         setting.

     /NOSCAN             Cancels the /SCAN switch  for  the  directory
                         path.   When  scanning  is  set,  the  system
                         searches  for  files   through   the   entire
                         directory  path.   For more information about
                         directory paths, see the  help  file  DIRPAT.
                         This  switch  disables  scanning.   Thus, the
                         system will not search  for  files  past  the
                         specified  directory  area.   See  the SETSRC
                         program  description  in  the  TOPS-10   User
                         Utilities  Manual.   /NOSCAN  is  the default
                         switch.

     /NOSETTTY           Instructs the system not  to  change  any  of
                         your  terminal's characteristics as specified
                         in your SWITCH.INI file.  The default  action
                         is   that  LOGIN  reads  SWITCH.INI,  setting
                         terminal   characteristics    according    to
                         switches  specified  in  the LOGIN line.  For
                         more information about  SWITCH.INI,  see  the
                         help file SWINI.

     /NOSFDCREATE        Does not create an SFD that was specified  as
                         the directory path.

     /NOSTR              Suppresses the printing of SYS:STR.TXT.

     /NOSYS              Removes  the   SYS:   structure   from   your
                         DSKspecification,  which is your job's search
                         list.   For  more  information  about  search
                         lists, see the help file SERLST.

     /NOTE:file-spec     Prints the specified file after you  log  in.
                         The  file  specification must be included; it
                         may  contain  wild-cards.   This  switch   is
                         useful  for  printing  a  project notice file
                         that is kept in a  library  area.   Refer  to
                         /NOTICE.

     /NOTICE:arg         Controls printing of SYS:NOTICE.TXT  and  the
                         argument  to the /NOTE switch.  The arguments
                         for /NOTICE are:

                         ALWAYS         Always prints notices.

                         SOMETIMES      Prints notices  you  have  not
                                        yet  seen.   SOMETIMES  is the
                                        default argument.

                         NEVER          Never prints notices.

     /NOWATCH            Suppresses the printing  of  incremental  job
                         statistics.   For  information  see the <SET>
                         command.

     /PASSWORD           Allows you to change your password during the
                         LOGIN   procedure.    Type  in  your  current
                         password at the Password: prompt.  Then  type
                         in your new password when the monitor prompts
                         you, and verify it.  Your password will  then
                         be  changed.   This  switch  is ignored under
                         batch.  The system manager may, at times, set
                         /PASSWORD  on  your account, so that when you
                         log  in,  you  will  have  to   change   your
                         password.

     /PATH:[dir]         Specifies a default path for disk  I/O.   For
                         more  information  about directory paths, see
                         the help file DIRPAT.

     /PHYSICAL:nx        Sets the maximum physical page limit of  your
                         job.  The value n is any decimal number.  The
                         value x is either K (for 1024-word blocks) or
                         P  (for  512-word pages).  You can use either
                         /LIMIT  or  /GUIDELINE  with  the   /PHYSICAL
                         switch.   The  default  is  /GUIDELINE.   For
                         information see the <SET> command.

     /QUOTA:             Recomputes the disk quota for  the  specified
      (str1,str2,...)    structures.  If  you  specify  more than  one
      ALL                structure,  you  must  separate the structure
      DSK                names with commas, and enclose  the  list  in
                         parentheses.   However,  if  you specify only
                         one  structure,  the  parentheses   are   not
                         required.   If you specify no structures, all
                         the structures in your job's search list  are
                         assumed.  Instead of (str1,str2,...), you can
                         use  ALL  or  DSK.   ALL   expands   to   all
                         structures in the system.  DSK expands to all
                         structures in your search list.

     /REMARK:"text"      Specifies a remark string for your  job.   If
                         you  include  non-alphanumeric  characters in
                         the remark, you must enclose  the  remark  in
                         quotation marks.

     /RUN:file-spec      Runs the specified program immediately  after
                         LOGIN,   unless   another  program  has  been
                         designated by the system manager.

     /SCAN               Sets the /SCAN switch for the directory path.
                         When  /SCAN is specified, scanning is enabled
                         for  the  directory  path.   Scanning  allows
                         searches  to  be  made  through  the complete
                         path.  If  scanning  is  disabled,  only  the
                         first  directory is searched.  See the SETSRC
                         program  description  in  the  TOPS-10   User
                         Utilities Manual.

     /SETTTY             Sets   your   terminal   characteristics   as
                         specified  in  the  file SWITCH.INI.  This is
                         the default function.  See the help SWINI for
                         information about the SWITCH.INI file.

     /SFDCREATE          Automatically   creates   an   SFD   on   the
                         structure,  if  the  SFD was specified as the
                         directory path,  and  if  the  SFD  does  not
                         already exist.  This is the default.

     /SFDPROT:nnn        Sets the protection of all  created  SFDs  to
                         nnn.

     /SPOOL:dev or       Adds the  specified  device(s) to the current
     /SPOOL:(dev1,...)   list of  those spooled for the job.  Spooling
        or               is  the  mechanism by  which  I/O to  or from
     /SPOOL:ALL          slow-speed  devices  is  simulated  on  disk.
                         Data   temporarily  stored  on  disk  can  be
                         automatically output on the specified  device
                         when it becomes available.  These devices can
                         be spooled:  the  line  printer  (LPT:),  the
                         card  punch  (CDP:),  the card reader (CDR:),
                         the paper-tape punch (PTP:), and the  plotter
                         (PLT:).

     /STR                Causes  all  files  in  the  standard  system
                         library  [1,4]  with  name  ???STR.TXT  to be
                         printed  on  your  terminal.    Assume,   for
                         example,  that  there  is  a  file on private
                         structure "PR:" called PRLSTR.TXT[1,4]  which
                         says:   "PR:PAYROLL  DEBUG  PACK  -- NOT REAL
                         DATA".  Any user who logged in with /STR  (or
                         had  /STR  in his SWITCH.INI file) would have
                         the warning message printed on his terminal.

     /SYS                Adds  the  SYS:  structure   to   your   DSK:
                         specification.   Consequently,  if  a file is
                         not found in the directories in  your  search
                         list  or  in your library directory (if /LIB:
                         [proj,prog] has been specified),  the  system
                         directory [1,4] will then be searched for the
                         file.

     /TERMINAL:          Sets     the     terminal     characteristics
     (arg,arg,...)       specified by the arguments.  This  switch  is
                         useful for recording terminal characteristics
                         in your SWITCH.INI file.  To specify a single
                         argument,   type  it  after  the  colon.   To
                         specify two or more arguments,  enclose  them
                         in parentheses and separate them with commas.

                         The arguments to  the  /TERMINAL  switch  and
                         their   meanings   are   listed   after   the
                         description of  the  switches.   All  of  the
                         arguments  except those which take values can
                         be preceded by NO to turn off the function of
                         the argument.

     /TIME:n             Sets a central  processor  time  limit  of  n
                         seconds  for  a  job.  When the time limit is
                         reached, the system stops the job and  prints
                         a   message.    A   timesharing  job  can  be
                         continued by typing CONTINUE, but unless  the
                         time  is  reset with the SET TIME command, no
                         time limit will be in effect.   A  batch  job
                         cannot be continued.

     /UFDPROT:nnn        Sets the protection of all  created  UFDs  to
                         nnn.

     /VIRTUAL:n          Specifies the current virtual page limit,  as
                         represented  by  n.   (For  a  description of
                         CVPL,   see   the   TOPS-10   Monitor   Calls
                         Manual.)  In    /VIRTUAL:nK    and   :nP,   K
                         represents a block, and P a page;  1K  equals
                         1024  words, and 1P equals 512 words.  If you
                         type neither letter, K is assumed.  K can  be
                         specified within the range 1 to 512P.  If you
                         type /VIRTUAL:0, the value of CVPL, as set by
                         the system administrator, is used.

     /WATCH:ALL or       Duplicates the  SET  WATCH  command, printing
     /WATCH (arg,arg...) messages  automatically  according   to   the
                         argument.    See  the  help  file  for  <SET>
                         command.

     Arguments to /TERMINAL

         Argument                           Meaning

     ALTMODE             Converts the ASCII  characters 175 and 176 to
     NOALTMODE           ALTmode (ESCape).  If you use NOALTMODE,  175
                         and  176  regain  their  original identity as
                         right brace (]) and tilde (~).   The  default
                         setting is NOALTMODE.

     BLANKS              Prints  blank  lines  during  output  to  the
     NOBLANKS            terminal.   NOBLANKS  is  often  used  on   a
                         display  terminal  to  conserve  space on the
                         screen.  The default setting is BLANKS.

     CRLF                Prints an automatic carriage-return/line-feed
     NOCRLF              at the end of each line.  The width  of  this
                         line  is  set  with WIDTH.  NOCRLF suppresses
                         the automatic carriage-return/line-feed.  The
                         default is CRLF.

     DEBREAK             No longer supported.
     NODEBREAK

     DEFER               Suppresses echoing of the characters you type
     NODEFER             until output to  the  terminal  is  finished.
                         For  example,  when  the  system  is  sending
                         output to your terminal and you type  another
                         command,  the system will echo the characters
                         as it is printing output  on  your  terminal.
                         DEFER holds the characters you type until the
                         output is finished.  NODEFER is  the  default
                         setting.    For   video   terminals,   it  is
                         recommended that you set DEFER.

     DISPLAY             Informs  the system  that  you have a display
     NODISPLAY           terminal.   Your  programs   can   use   this
                         information   when  sending  output  to  your
                         terminal.  NO DISPLAY turns off  the  DISPLAY
                         function.

     ECHO                Prints  the  characters   you  type  on  your
     NOECHO              terminal.  This puts your  terminal  in  full
                         duplex  mode.   NOECHO  puts your terminal in
                         half duplex mode.  That  is,  the  characters
                         you type are not printed on your terminal.

     EIGHTBIT            Sets 8-bit mode.
     NOEIGHTBIT

     ESCAPE:chr          Sets the <ESCAPE>  translation  character  to
                         chr.

     FILL:n              Controls  the filler class of  the  terminal.
     NOFILL              This effects the output of filler characters.
                         NOFILL is the equivalent to FILL:0.

     FORM                Sends   eight   line-feeds   for  every  FORM
     NOFORM              character,  and  four  line-feeds  for   each
                         vertical  tab.   NOFORM  does  not  send  the
                         line-feeds.

     GAG                 Suppresses  any  messages  sent  by  the SEND
     NOGAG               command when your job is in user mode.   This
                         does  not  affect messages from the operator.
                         NOGAG allows you to receive messages  at  any
                         stage of your job.

     LC                  Allows   the   system   to   print  lowercase
     NOLC                characters  on  your  terminal  when  echoing
                         characters from your terminal.  This argument
                         is used  on  terminals  that  have  lowercase
                         ability   but   are  not  printing  lowercase
                         characters.  NOLC makes the system  translate
                         all input characters to uppercase as they are
                         transmitted.

     LENGTH:n            Sets the terminal page length to n lines.

     LOCALCOPY           Sets terminal to local copy.
     NOLOCALCOPY

     QUOTE               Enables control-v character quoting.
     NOQUOTE

     RCVSPEED:nnnn       Sets the speed at which  your  terminal  will
                         receive characters to n baud.

     RTCOMP              Controls  the function of CTRL/R  and CTRL/T.
     NORTCOMP            NORTCOMP   makes   the   control   characters
                         function  as  they  are  described in Section
                         1.6.  RTCOMP prevents them  from  functioning
                         this  way,  which  is useful when you plan to
                         run a program that uses CTRL/R and CTRL/T for
                         other purposes.

     SBELL               Rings   the   bell   when  output  is stopped
     NOSBELL             automatically    by    the   system.  NOSBELL
                         suppresses  the  terminal bell when output is
                         stopped automatically by the system.

     SPEED:nnnn          Sets the receiving and transmitting speed  of
                         your terminal to n baud.

     SSTOP:n             Sets the terminal  to  stop  output  after  n
                         lines,  where  n  is  page  length,  ignoring
                         intermittent <CTRL/Q>s.

     STOP:n              Sets the terminal  to  stop  output  after  n
                         lines, where n is page length.

     TABS                Informs  the system  that  your terminal  has
     NOTABS              tab stops.  NOTABS informs  the  system  that
                         your  terminal  does not have tab stops.  The
                         system will then simulate tab stops for  your
                         terminal.

     TAPE                Informs  the system  that  your terminal  has
     NOTAPE              paper tape output.  This changes the function
                         of  CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  to control the paper
                         tape.  NOTAPE restores the function of CTRL/S
                         and CTRL/Q.

     TIDY                No longer supported.
     NOTIDY

     TYPE:nnnn           Specifies the type of terminal.  This informs
                         the  system that your terminal is of the type
                         nnnn.    This   sets   some   characteristics
                         automatically.    For   a  complete  list  of
                         supported terminal types, type:

                         HELP *

                         A portion of the information  returned  is  a
                         list  of  terminal  types  supported  by  the
                         monitor.

     UC                  Tells   the  system  to  translate  all   the
     NOUC                characters  that  it   receives   from   your
                         terminal   to  upper  case.   NOUC  does  not
                         translate the characters.

     UNPAUSE:chr         Sets the unpause character to chr.

     WIDTH:n             Sets the width of the terminal screen  to  n.
                         Used  in conjunction with CRLF, this controls
                         the automatic  RETURNs  that  are  output  at
                         monitor level.

     XMTSPEED:n          Sets the speed at which  your  terminal  will
                         send characters to n baud.

     XONXOF              Allows  you  to  use  CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  to
     NOXONXOF            control  the   output   to   your   terminal.
                         NOXONXOF  prevents  the  system from stopping
                         terminal output automatically.

Characteristics

     Returns your terminal  to monitor  level or starts  a program  if
     specified in ACTDAE.SYS.

Associated Messages

     If you are already logged in when you issue  the  LOGIN  command,
     the monitor prints:

     ?PLEASE KJOB OR DETACH

     If the system is running  the  maximum  number  of  jobs  it  can
     handle,  you  will not be able to log in.  When you issue a LOGIN
     command, you will receive the message:

     ?JOB CAPACITY EXCEEDED

     In this event, wait a few minutes, then try again.

Examples

     1.  To gain access to the system, log in with your user  name  as
         follows:

         .LOGIN MCWILLIAMS
         JOB 42 RZ373B KL#1026/1042 TTY363

         If you do not type your  project-programmer  number  or  your
         user  name  on  the  same  line  as  the LOGIN command, LOGIN
         prompts you for that information with a number sign (#).

         .LOGIN<RET>
         JOB 29 RZ373B KL #1026/1042 TTY220
         #10,6073<RET>

         LOGIN prints  your  assigned  job  number  (job  number  29),
         followed  by  monitor  name,  version  number,  and  terminal
         number.

         PASSWORD:<RET>

         The system prompts you for  your  password.   You  type  your
         password followed by a carriage-return.  To maintain password
         security, the  monitor  does  not  echo  your  password.   On
         terminals  with  local-copy  (see  the  TOPS-10 Monitor Calls
         Manual), a mask is printed to make your password unreadable.

         [LGNLAS  Last   access   to   [10,6073]   succeeded   on
         dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss]
         hh:mm dd-mmm-yy MON
         .

         If your entries are  correct,  the  system  responds  with  a
         message  indicating  when  the  last attempt to login to your
         account was, and whether it was successful time, date, day of
         the  week,  the  message  of  the day (if any), and a period,
         indicating readiness to accept another command.

     2.  The following example illustrates the process of detaching  a
         job,  logging  in  a second job, detaching the second job and
         logging in a third  job.   First,  detach  the  job  that  is
         currently running:

         .DETACH<RET>
         FROM JOB 52

         Then log in again:

         .LOGIN 27,5434<RET>
         JOB 54 RZ125A KL #1022/1046 TTY213
         PASSWORD: <RET>

         OTHER JOBS DETACHED WITH SAME PPN:
             JOB 52 PIP STOPPED

         DO YOU WANT TO ATTACH TO THIS JOB?  [Y] NO<RET>
         [LGNJSP OTHER JOBS SAME PPN:52]
         [LGNLAS Last access to [27,5434] succeeded on
         dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss]
         hh:mm dd-mmm-yy       MON

         When you log in, if you have a detached job (logged  in  with
         /ATTACH:ASK),  LOGIN prompts you whether you want to log in a
         new job or attach to the existing  job.   (To  suppress  this
         function,  use the /ATTACH:IGNORE switch when you log in.) To
         log in a new job at this point, type NO and press RETURN.  If
         you  type  YES  or  just  press RETURN, your terminal will be
         attached to the existing job.

         Detaching a job is useful when you are running a program  you
         expect  to  run for a long time.  If you want to allow such a
         program  to  run,  while  you  start  another  job,  use  the
         CCONTINUE  command.  For example, start a DIRECTORY search of
         SYS:

         .DIRECT EXEVER.SYS=SYS:*.EXE/PRVERSION<RET>
         ^C
         ^C
         .CCONTINUE<RET>

         The DIRECT program continues to  search  for  files  in  SYS:
         with  the  extension  .EXE,  and  stores  them in EXEVER.SYS.
         Meanwhile, you can log in a third job.  To  log  in  a  third
         job, first detach the second:

         .DETACH<RET>
         FROM JOB 54

         Log in:

         .LOGIN 27,5434/ATTACH:IGNORE<RET>
         JOB 55 RZ125A KL #1022/1046 TTY213
         PASSWORD: <RET>

         [LGNJSP OTHER JOBS SAME PPN:52,54]
         [LGNLAS Last access to [27,5434] succeeded on
         dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss]
         hh:mm dd-mmm-yy       MON

         .

         The /ATTACH:IGNORE switch  was  used  here  to  suppress  the
         question  about existing detached jobs.  To log in a new job,
         as here, press RETURN.

         When the DIRECT program is finished running (as may  be  seen
         using  SYSDPY),  you  may  want to attach back to job 54.  In
         this case, detach the current job, or log out:

         .K<RET>

                  TOTAL OF 344 FILES
         .

         LOGIN prints a message after attaching to  the  running  job.
         This  message  informs  you that the job is in the process of
         running.  Then DIRECTORY prints a message showing  the  total
         number of files found.
