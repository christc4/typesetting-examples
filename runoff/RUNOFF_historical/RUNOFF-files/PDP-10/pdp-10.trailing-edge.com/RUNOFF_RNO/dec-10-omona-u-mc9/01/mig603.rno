^IN ADDITION TO INITIALLY INSTALLING THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM,
YOU MUST INSTALL THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM USING THE STEPS OUTLINED
IN THIS ^CHAPTER IF YOU EVER DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
.LS;.LE;^REINITIALIZE THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM.
.LE;^CHANGE THE FRONT-END HARDWARE.
.LE;^DESTROY THE FRONT-END FILE SYSTEM.
.ELS
^THE FIRST STEP IS TO MOUNT THE ^^DEC\\TAPE LABELED ^^RSX20-F\\.
^PLACE THE ^^RSX20-F\\ TAPE (VERSION 0005^J) ON ONE OF THE
FRONT-END (^^PDP\\-11) ^D^E^CTAPE DRIVES. ^MAKE SURE THAT THE
^UNIT ^SELECTOR ^SWITCH IS SET TO 0. ^THIS ^D^E^CTAPE
DRIVE IS CALLED ^D^T0 WHEN YOU SPECIFY IT BY NAME.
.B
^ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ^UNIT ^SELECTOR ^SWITCH, SET THE
RIGHTMOST BUTTON TO ^^REMOTE\\. ^SET THE LEFTMOST BUTTON (ON
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ^UNIT ^SELECTOR ^SWITCH THAT IS SET TO 0)
TO ^^WRITE ENABLE\\.
.B
^ON THE OTHER ^D^E^CTAPE DRIVE, SET THE ^UNIT ^SELECTOR
^SWITCH TO 1; MOUNT THE ^^RSX20-F\\ ^AUXILIARY ^FILES ^D^E^CTAPE;
SET THE SWITCHES FOR THIS DRIVE (^D^T1) THE SAME AS YOU DID
FOR ^D^T0.
.B
^MOUNT THE MANUFACTURING TAPE (LABELED ^^YURMON\\ AND YOUR
INSTALLATION'S NAME) ON ^^MTA\\0 (-10 DEVICE). ^IF YOU ARE NOT
A NEW INSTALLATION AND WOULD LIKE TO CREATE YOUR OWN ^MANUFACTURING
TAPE, FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE LISTED BELOW.
.B;.LM5;.TS10;.NF;.NJ
_.^^GET	SYS:BACKUP
_.SAVE	MTA0:BACKUP
_.SAVE	MTA0:BACKUP
_.START
/TAPE	MTA0:
/SAVE	DSKB:[1,4]=DSKB\\:*.*[1,4]
.B;.LM0;.F;.J
^THE ABOVE PROCEDURE SAVES TWO COPIES OF ^^BACKUP\\ AND THE [1,4]
DISK AREA (^^SYS\\:).
.B
^YOU CAN MOUNT THIS MAGNETIC TAPE ON ANOTHER MAGTAPE DRIVE
(OTHER THAN ^^MTA\\0); HOWEVER, ^^MTA\\0 IS ASSUMED IN THE
FOLLOWING EXAMPLE. ^MOUNT A RECENTLY FORMATTED DISK PACK ON
^^RPA\\0 (OR ANOTHER DRIVE, BUT ^^RPA\\0 IS ASSUMED). ^WHICHEVER
DRIVE YOU CHOOSE, IT MUST BE DUAL-PORTED WITH THE ^R^H11.
.B
^TO REFER TO THE "-11" DISK PACK, YOU SPECIFY A DEVICE
NAME IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
.B;.I5
^D^B UNIT-NUMBER:
.B
WHERE UNIT-NUMBER IS 0-7. ^FOR EXAMPLE, ^^RPA\\0 IS THE EQUIVALENT
OF ^^DB0, RPA\\1 IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ^D^B1, AN ^^RPC\\3 IS THE
EQUIVALENT OF ^D^B3.
.B
^SET THE DATA SWITCHES ON THE -11 FRONT PANEL TO 000001. ^MAKE
SURE THE ^^ENABLE\\ SWITCH IS ON; THEN, PUSH THE ^^SW/REG\\
SWITCH. ^THE TAPE WILL BEGIN LOADING. ^REFER TO ^TABLE 14-1
FOR A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN YOU PRESS THE ^^SW/REG\\
SWITCH.

^THE NUMBER OF FILES YOU SHOULD RESTORE FROM THE MONITOR DISTRIBUTION

^IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH DISK SPACE AVAILABLE, YOU SHOULD ALSO
RESTORE ALL THE FILES FROM OTHER DISTRIBUTION TAPES USING THE
APPROPRIATE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBER.
^OTHERWISE, YOU MAY NEED TO SELECTIVELY RESTORE CERTAIN FILES,
BECAUSE YOU MAY NEED SOME UNBUNDLED FILES FOR YOUR MONITOR.
^ALSO, SOME OF THE UTILITY PROGRAMS, ASSUMED TO BE ON THE MONITOR
DISTRIBUTION TAPE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, MAY BE ON THE
LANGUAGE DISTRIBUTION TAPE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE PACKAGING
PROCEDURE.

VERSIONS OF ALL FILES ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE, AND YOU NEED NOT
WORRY ABOUT SELECTIVELY RESTORING INDIVIDUAL FILES.

^BE SURE THAT THE UNBUNDLED PACKAGE NAME (E.G., ^^XTCSER,
TYPSER\\, OR ^^D78INT\\) PRECEDES ^^TOP?10\\. ^THIS MUST BE
DONE SO THAT .^^SYSINI, ONCE\\, ETC. WILL BE LOADED LAST AND,
THEREFORE, CAN BE DISCARDED AFTER INITIALIZATION.
.B
^USING THE COMMANDS IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLES, ^^LINK\\ WILL PRODUCE
A LOAD MAP NAMED ^^YURMON.MAP\\. ^THE MONITOR SAVE FILE WILL
BE ^^YURMON.SAVE\\ OR ^^YURMON.HGH\\ AND ^^YURMON.LOW\\. ^THESE

^NOTE THAT ^^LINK\\-10 ALLOWS YOU TO LOAD AND SAVE A PROGRAM
IN THE SAME COMMAND STRING. ^ALSO, CERTAIN SWITCH SETTINGS
CAN SPEED UP THE LOADING PROCESS. ^^MAXCOR:60K\\ IS
ABOUT THE MINIMUM CORE NECESSARY FOR LOADING THE MONITOR; IF
NO PARAMETER IS SET, HOWEVER, ^^LINK\\-10 WILL EXPAND TO USE
UP TO ONE HALF THE USER CORE. ^USING A ^^HASH\\ SIZE OF 6000
IS AN UPPER LIMIT WHICH SHOULD WORK FOR ANY SYSTEM. ^FOR THE
SAKE OF ECONOMY, IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER SYSTEM, YOU SHOULD TRY

^^DEC\\TAPE, OR YOU CAN LOAD USING THE SWICTH REGISTER. ^IN MOST CASES,
YOU WILL LOAD FROM A DISK PACK BECAUSE IT IS MUCH FASTER THAN ^^DEC\\TAPE.
^HOWEVER, IF DUAL-PORT HARDWARE PROBLEMS PREVENT LOADING FROM A DISK
PACK, OR IF YOUR SYSTEM MANAGER WANTS YOU TO USE SOFTWARE RESIDING
ON A ^^DEC\\TAPE, YOU MAY NEED TO LOAD THE SYSTEM USING THE ^^DEC\\TAPE
DRIVE. ^ALSO, IF YOU NEED TO LOAD THE SYSTEM USING SOME NON-STANDARD
HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS OR SPECIAL SOFTWARE, YOU WILL HAVE TO USE
THE SWITCH REGISTER. ^THE SWITCH REGISTER ALLOWS YOU TO LOAD
FROM ANY DISK PACK OR ^^DEC\\TAPE AND ALSO ENTER THE ^K^L INITIALIZATION
OPERATOR DIALOGUE (^^KLINIT\\). ^THE ^^KLINIT\\ DIALOGUE ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE
SUCH NONDEFAULT PATHS AS CONFIGURING MEMORY YOURSELF, LOADING A
BOOTSTRAP PROGRAM FROM ANY FILE, AND LOADING A NONDEFAULT MONITOR.
^THE PROCEDURES FOR LOADING THE FRONT-END PROCESSOR VIA A DISK PACK
(^SITUATION ^A), A ^^DEC\\TAPE (^SITUATION ^B), OR THE
SWITCH REGISTER (^SITUATION ^C) ARE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT THREE SECTIONS.
.B
^&^SITUATION ^A: ^LOADING ^^RSX-20F\\ FROM ^DISK\&
.B
^THIS IS THE MOST COMMON WAY TO LOAD THE CONSOLE FRONT END. ^IT
ASSUMES THAT THE SYSTEM POWER IS ^^ON\\, THAT ALL HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY INSTALLED, AND THAT THE DISK PACK
HAS BEEN MOUNTED PROPERLY. ^ALSO, THE DISK PACK CONTAINING BOTH THE
^^TOPS-10\\ MONITOR AND THE ^^RSX-20F\\ FRONT-END MONITOR MUST BE
ON A DUAL-PORTED DRIVE (CONTROLLER SELECT SWITCH POINTS TO ^A/^B),
AND THE DRIVE MUST BE UNIT 0 WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE CENTRAL
AND FRONT-END PROCESSORS.

^THE OPERATION IS AS FOLLOWS:
.LS;.LE;^SET THE ^^ENABLE/DISABLE\\ LOAD SWITCH TO ^^ENABLE.\\
.B
^THIS WILL ENABLE THE OTHER THREE LOAD SWITCHES.
.LE;^PRESS THE ^^DISK\\ LOAD SWITCH.
.B
^THIS WILL CAUSE THE FRONT-END PROCESSOR TO ACCESS THE DISK ON
DRIVE 0 AND LOAD THE ^^RSX-20F\\ MONITOR. ^THE ^K^L INITIALIZATION
PROGRAM (^^KLINIT\\) IS LOADED AND THE DEFAULT HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS
OF CACHE AND EXTERNAL MEMORY ARE SET UP. ^THE BOOTSTRAP PROGRAM

.SP1
.HL1 ^&INTRODUCTION\&
\\^^BACKUP\\ IS A SYSTEM PROGRAM THAT IS USED TO SAVE DISK FILES
ON MAGNETIC TAPE, AND LATER TO RESTORE ANY OR ALL OF THESE FILES TO
DISK. ^MAGNETIC TAPE IS THE MEDIUM USED FOR BACKUP STORAGE
OF DISK FILES AND FOR TRANSPORTING FILES BETWEEN SITES. ^THIS CHAPTER
OUTLINES SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT ^^BACKUP\\ PROVIDES FOR ACCOMPLISHING
THESE TWO TASKS.
.HL1 ^&FEATURES\&
\\^^BACKUP\\ ALLOWS YOU FLEXIBILITY IN CHOOSING THE FILES TO BE TRANSFERRED
BETWEEN DISK AND TAPE. ^YOU SPECIFY FILES BY THE STANDARD FILE
SPECIFICATION FORMAT OF DEV:FILENAME.EXT[PROJECT,PROGRAMMMER].
^WILDCARDS AND SUB-FILE DIRECTORIES ARE FULLY SUPPORTED. ^YOU MAY
ALSO SELECT FILES BASED ON ANY OF THE DATES/TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH DISK
FILES.
.B
^^BACKUP\\ CAN HANDLE FILES THAT ARE LONGER THAN ONE REEL OF MAGTAPE.
^SWITCHES ARE PROVIDED FOR CHECKPOINTING FILES WHILE THE FILES ARE
BEING HANDLED.
.B
^IF YOU ARE BACKING UP THE DISK FILE STRUCTURE,
YOU CAN RECOVER FROM A SYSTEM CRASH WITHOUT
STARTING COMPLETELY OVER. ^YOU CAN PRODUCE A DIRECTORY LISTING OF THE TAPE 
AT THE SAME TIME YOU PERFORM A SAVE. ^ANOTHER OPERATOR FEATURE IS A SET
OF RUN-TIME COMMANDS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SPOOLERS.
.B
^TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTING FILES BETWEEN SITES, ^^BACKUP\\ PROVIDES
AN "INTERCHANGE" MODE OF OPERATION THAT PREVENTS THE WRITING OF
SYSTEM SPECIFIC OVERHEAD INFORMATION ON THE TAPE. ^SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION
TAPES FOR THE ^^DEC\\SYSTEM-10 ARE PRODUCED VIA ^^BACKUP\\ IN
INTERCHANGE MODE.
.B

^THE FILE SPECIFICATIONS MAY CONTAIN WILDCARDS AND SUB-FILE DIRECTORIES.
.B
^FOR EACH ENTRY IN THE LIST, YOU MAY SPECIFY BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT
FILE SPECIFICATIONS (OUTPUT=INPUT) OR JUST THE INPUT SPECIFICATION.
^THIS ALLOWS THE FILES TO BE RENAMED AS THEY ARE SAVED OR RESTORED.

.HL1 ^&BACKUP TAPE FORMAT\&
\\^NOTE THAT ^BACKUP IS DESIGNED FOR TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS:
PERFORMING SYSTEM BACKUP AND INTERCHANGING FILES BETWEEN SYSTEMS. ^FOR THE LATTER
FUNCTION, ^BACKUP PROVIDES AN "INTERCHANGE" SWITCH WHICH CAUSES SYSTEM
DEPENDENT DATA TO BE IGNORED AND ONLY CRITICAL FILE INFORMATION TO BE
WRITTEN ON TAPE. ^A RESTORE OPERATION IN INTERCHANGE
MODE ALSO IGNORES SYSTEM DEPENDENT DATA, ALLOWING THE OPERATING SYSTEM
TO SUPPLY DEFAULTS WHERE NECESSARY. ^ITEMS NOT INCLUDED IN INTERCHANGE MODE
ARE NOTED IN THE DESCRIPTION WHICH FOLLOWS.
.HL2 ^&TAPE RECORD TYPES\&
\\^^BACKUP\\ TAPES ARE MADE UP OF A SERIES OF TAPE RECORDS OF
VARIOUS TYPES. ^EACH RECORD IS SELF IDENTIFYING. ^ALL RECORDS ON THE
TAPE ARE WRITTEN AT THE STANDARD LENGTH OF 544(10) WORDS, MADE UP OF 
A 32(10) WORD HEADER AND A 512(10) DATA AREA. ^EVEN IF THE DATA AREA IS NOT
NEEDED, OR IS ONLY PARTIALLY NEEDED IT IS FULLY WRITTEN. ^ALL UNDEFINED
OR UNUSED WORDS ARE WRITTEN WITH ZEROES AND IGNORED ON READ.
^THIS MAXIMIZES THE PROBABILITY OF READING OLD TAPES. ^IN ANY CASE, THE
TAPE FORMAT IS INCLUDED IN THE LABELS AND THE SAVE SET HEADERS.

^THE RECORD TYPES ARE:
