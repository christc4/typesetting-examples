.SKIP 1
ADVAOV IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND HIGHLY INTERACTIVE STATISTICAL PROGRAM
WHICH INCORPORATES MOST OF THE DATA ANALYSIS FEATURES COMMONLY USED IN THE
ANALYSIS OF ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (AOV) DATA.
.SKIP 1
ASSUME THROUGHOUT THIS DESCRIPTION THAT THERE ARE K EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS.
.SKIP 1
THE USER AUTOMATICALLY OBTAINS AS OUTPUT:
.BREAK
	(I)####A ONE-WAY AOV TABLE (AN F STATISTIC IS CALCULATED WHICH IS
.BREAK
	#########USED TO TEST THE EQUALITY OF THE K POPULATION MEANS),
.BREAK

	#########EACH OF THE K GROUPS), AND
.BREAK
	(III)##BARTLETT'S TEST STATISTIC (WHICH IS USED TO TEST THE
.BREAK

	#########EQUALITY OF THE K POPULATION VARIANCES).
.SKIP 1
A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS FEATURE IS CONTAINED IN SECTION 2.0.
.SKIP 1
ONE OF THREE DIFFERENT  DATA ENTRY METHODS MAY BE CHOSEN:
.BREAK
.SKIP 1
	(I)####DATA ENTRY METHOD 1--(RAW DATA FOR EACH GROUP IS ENTERED),
.BREAK
	(II)###DATA ENTRY METHOD 2--(A BREAKDOWN VARIABLE IS SPECIFIED

THE USER MAY CONTINUE THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA BY ELECTING ONE OR MORE OF
SEVERAL DATA OPTIONS AVAILABLE.  USING THESE OPTIONS THE USER MAY:

	#########[(I)-(VII)] ARE ALSO APPLICABLE TO TRANSFORMED DATA.
.SKIP 1

OTHER OPTIONS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE WHICH DO NOT ANALYZE OR PROCESS DATA,
BUT WHICH CAN BE HELPFUL.  THESE INCLUDE OPTIONS WHICH ALLOW THE USER TO:

REMARK 7 (WHICH SIMULTANEOUS TESTING PROCEDURE TO USE?)
.BREAK
-------------------------------------------------------
.BREAK
CLEARLY THERE IS NO SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION OF THE QUESTION "WHICH SIMULTANEOUS PROCEDURE TO USE?".  MANY RESEARCHERS MAKE THIS DECISION BASED
ON ERROR RATES.  FOR CONTROL OF THE "EXPERIMENTWISE" ERROR RATE

THE SCHEFFE, TUKEY, AND PROTECTED LSD PROCEDURES ARE RECOMMENDED.  FOR
CONTROL OF THE "INDIVIDUAL TEST" ERROR RATE, THE UNPROTECTED LSD IS EXACTLY
DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  THE NEWMAN-KEULS, DUNCAN, AND PROTECTED LSD
PROCEDURE AFFORD CONTROL, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OF THE
"INDIVIDUAL TEST" ERROR RATE.
.SKIP 1
IN MAKING A CHOICE OF A SIMULTANEOUS TESTING PROCEDURE IT IS OFTEN
MOST IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE YOUR RESULTS TO PREVIOUSLY
REPORTED SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.  IN THESE CASES IT IS 
WISE TO CONSIDER USING THE SAME SIMULTANEOUS TESTING PROCEDURE WITH THE
SAME ERROR BASIS (EXPERIMENTWISE OR INDIVIDUAL) AND THE SAME ERROR RATE AS THE PREVIOUS WORK.

THE FOLLOWING RULES MAY BE USED TO ASSIST THE USER IN
DECIDING WHICH MULTIPLE COMPARISON PROCEDURE TO USE.
.SKIP 1
RULE 1
.BREAK
ONLY USE THE SCHEFFE PROCEDURE IF SIMULTANEOUS COMPARISONS
ARE WANTED FOR OTHER CONTRASTS OF ##(1), ##(2),...,#(K) IN ADDITION TO THE
PAIRWISE COMPARISONS.  THE SCHEFFE SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
FOR GENERAL CONTRASTS MAY BE OBTAINED BY USING THE OPTION: COMPAR.
.SKIP 1
RULE 2
.BREAK
IF PRIMARY INTEREST IS IN PAIRWISE COMPARISONS AND IF THE SAMPLES ARE 
BALANCED  (N(1) = N(2) = ... = N(K)), THEN THE#TUKEY METHOD OF MULTIPLE
COMPARISON IS RECOMMENDED.
.SKIP 1
IN THIS CASE THE TUKEY METHOD PRODUCES SLIGHTLY NARROWER CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
THAN DOES BONFERRONI'S METHOD.  BOTH THE TUKEY AND BONFERRONI METHODS
PRODUCE CONSIDERABLY NARROWER SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
THAN DOES THE SCHEFFE METHOD FOR PAIRWISE COMPARISONS.  FOR A FURTHER
DISCUSSION OF THIS POINT SEE MILLER [7].
.SKIP 1
RULE 3
.BREAK
IF PRIMARY INTEREST IS IN PAIRWISE COMPARISONS AND IF THE SAMPLES ARE UNBALANCED, THEN THE METHOD RECOMMENDED (EXTENDED TUKEY OR BONFERRONI) 
DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF UNBALANCE IN THE AOV MODEL.  A ROUGH RULE
OF THUMB FOR DETERMINING WHICH PROCEDURE TO USE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY
EMMERT[12].  URY[13] DISCUSSES THIS ISSUE ALSO.

.SKIP 1
	U = 1;  (THE MODEL IS BALANCED)
.BREAK
	U > 1;  (THE MODEL IS UNBALANCED)
.SKIP 1
IT IS RECOMMENDED IN [12] AND [13] THAT IF U < 1.25 (SMALL TO
MODEST UNBALANCE), THEN USE THE (EXTENDED) TUKEY METHOD.  IF U > 1.25
(MODEST TO LARGE UNBALANCE), THEN USE THE BONFERRONI METHOD.

FROM OPTION VAR IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE REASON THAT THE HYPOTHESIS

SINCE BARTLETT'S TEST IS SIGNIFICANT AT THE 1% LEVEL AND ALSO SINCE THE 
SAMPLE SIZES ARE VERY UNBALANCED, THE F-VALUE OF 31.118 IN THE AOV TABLE
SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.  A PROPER DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE
