DESCRIPTION
.BREAK
-----------
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
BANK IS A DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR INTERACTIVE TERMINAL USE.
DIRECTIONS TO THE PROGRAM ARE ENTERED ON ONE OR MORE LINES, WITH THE
ONLY PROMPTING BEING A QUESTION MARK INDICATING THE PROGRAM'S READINESS
TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS. OPTIONS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND DETAILED
EXPLANATIONS ARE AVAILABLE BY SIMPLY TYPING "HELP". THE PROGRAM HANDLES
FIXED (INTEGER), FLOATING (DECIMAL), AND ALPHANUMERIC DATA, AND HAS THE
ABILITY TO EASILY CHANGE DATA FROM ONE OF THESE MODES TO ANOTHER.  DATA
IS IN A TABLE FORM, WITH THE COLUMNS CORRESPONDING TO VARIABLES AND ROWS
TO OBSERVATIONS. VARIABLES MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY EITHER VARIABLE NUMBERS,
OR USER SPECIFIED VARIABLE NAMES.  TO ELIMINATE FORMATTING PROBLEMS AND
DECREASE DATA RECOVERY TIME, BANKS ARE WRITTEN AS RANDOM ACCESS BINARY
FILES.  THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE BANK PROGRAM MAY BE SUMMARIZED IN THE
FOLLOWING LIST:
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 15
.INDENT -10
CREATE A BANK FILE:##USER MAY CREATE A BANK FILE FROM ANY ASCII
FILE.  INFORMATION OTHER THAN ACTUAL DATA WHICH WILL BE INCLUDED
IN THE BANK ARE:##VARIABLE NAMES, DESCRIPTIONS, AND MODES.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT -10
CHANGE DATA:##USER MAY REPLACE DATA LOCATED IN THE BANK WITH NEW
VALUES OF THE SAME MODE.  VARIABLE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS MAY ALSO 
BE MODIFIED.  CHANGES MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED ONE VALUE AT A TIME
OR BY GROUPS.
.SKIP 1

.INDEX CREATION OF A BANK
CREATION OF A BANK
.BREAK
------------------
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
THE FIRST INFORMATION REQUESTED WILL BE THE NAME OF THE BANK.  TO CREATE
A BANK, A NAME (UP TO 5 CHARACTERS NO EXTENSION NECESSARY) NOT ALREADY
ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER BANK SHOULD BE ENTERED.  IF THE SAME NAME HAS NOT 
BEEN USED PREVIOVSLY, THE USER WILL BE INFORMED THAT A BANK IS TO BE
CREATED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL THEN BE REQUESTED:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
FIRST THE USER WILL BE ASKED TO SUPPLY THE INPUT DATA FILE FOR THE BANK.
THE DEVICE FOLLOWED BY A COLON, AND A FILE NAME (IF NECESSARY) SHOULD BE
ENTERED.  DEFAULT IS "DSK:INPUT.DAT".
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
THE USER WILL THEN BE INSTRUCTED TO SPECIFY THE EXACT NUMBER OF
VARIABLES TO BE USED IN THE BANK.  ANY NUMBER OF VARIABLES BETWEEN 1 AND
500 MAY BE CREATED.  THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES ENTERED AT THIS TIME DOES
NOT LIMIT THE CREATION OF NEW VARIABLES IN THE BANK AT A LATER TIME.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
WHEN REQUESTED, THE USER SHOULD ENTER THE FORTRAN FORMAT OF THE INPUT
DATA ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES.  UP TO 600 CHARACTERS MAY  BE USED
FOR THE FORMAT.  IN ADDITION TO LOCATING THE DATA, THE FORMAT IS ALSO
USED TO DETERMINE THE MODES OF THE VARIABLES.  ONLY THE FOLLOWING
FORMAT ARE ALLOWED:  A,I,F,G,E,D,O,AND X.  BOTH G AND D WILL BE TREATED
AS SINGLE PRECISION FLOATING POINT VARIABLES.  IF THE FORMAT IS LOCATED
IN A FILE UNDER THE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER THE BANK IS BEING RUN FROM, THE
USER MAY INDICATE THE FILE BY TYPING AN @ AND THE FILENAME.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
FINALLY THE USER WILL BE ASKED TO ENTER NAMES, DESCRIPTIONS AND MISSING
DATA SYMBOLS.  VARIABLES WILL HAVE DEFAULT NAMES (V1, V2, V3...), AND
DEFAULT DESCRIPTIONS (ORIGINAL VARIABLE NUMBER 1 - ORANGE.BNK).  IF THE
DEFAULT INFORMATION IS NOT TO BE CHANGED THE USER SIMPLY TYPES A
 CARRIAGE RETURN.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
TO CHANGE THE INFORMATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR VARIABLE, THE USER RESPONDS
BY TYPING THE VARIABLE NUMBER, AN EQUAL SIGN (=), THE NEW NAME FOR THE
VARIABLE, A SEMICOLON (;), THE NEW DESCRIPTION, AND A SLASH FOLLOWED BY
A MISSING DATA SYMBOL.  EXAMPLE:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
17=SEX;SEX OF RESPONDANT/0
.SKIP 1
THE NAME GIVEN TO VARIABLE 17 IS SEX, THE DESCRIPTION WILL BE
"SEX OF RESPONDANT", AND THE VALUE ZERO WILL BE TREATED AS MISSING
DATA.  THE DEFAULT NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS WILL BE USED UNLESS CHANGED.
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 5
.INDENT 5
IF THE NAME IS TO BE CHANGED, IT MUST FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE =
SIGN WITH NO INTERVENING SPACES.  THE NAME MAY BE UP TO FIVE CHARACTERS
LONG. THE FIRST CHARACTER MUST BE A LETTER, AND ALL OTHER CHARACTERS
MUST EITHER BE LETTERS OR NUMBERS (DASHES, APPENSAND, SLASHES, ETC., ARE
NOT PERMITTED). THERE ARE A FEW RESERVED WORDS WHICH MAY NOT BE ASSIGNED
AS VARIABLE NAMES, THEY ARE:##"OBS", "STOP", "HELP", "ALL", OR "EMPTY".
.PAGE
.INDENT 5
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE VARIABLES ARE ENTERED FOLLOWING THE NAME (IF ONE WAS
GIVEN).  DESCRIPTIONS ARE PRECEDED BY A SEMICOLON AND MAY BE UP TO 40
CHARACTERS LONG.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
MISSING DATA SYMBOLS ARE ENTERED PRECEDED BY A SLASH (/).  UP TO FIVE
MISSING DATA SYMBOLS MAY BE ENTERED PER VARIABLE.  MISSING DATA MUST
AGREE IN MODE WITH THE VARIABLE FOR WHICH IT IS DEFINED, THUS
ALPHANUMERIC TYPE VARIABLES (VARIABLE DEFINED WITH AN "A" FORMAT) MUST
HAVE THE MISSING VALUE ENCLOSED IN QUOTES.  THE USER MAY ALSO DEFINE A
RANGE OF VALID DATA FOR EACH VARIABLE.  ANY VALUE NOT WITHIN THE RANGE
OF VALID DATA WILL BE TREATED AS MISSING.  VALID DATA RANGES ARE ENTERED
BY TYPING A SLASH (/), THE PHRASE "VALID:", AND THE EXTREMES OF THE
VALID RANGE SEPARATED BY A MINUS (-).  VALUES WHICH HAVE BEEN DENOTED
AS MISSING WILL BE REPLACED BY THE OCTAL CONSTANT 400000000000 IN THE
BANK.
.SKIP 1
.LEFT MARGIN 0
.INDENT 5
VARIABLE NAMES, DESCRIPTIONS, OR MISSING DATA MAY ALSO BE DEFINED
FOR RANGES OF VARIABLES.  RANGES OF VARIABLES ARE DEFINED BY TYPING THE
EXTREMES OF THE RANGE SEPARATED BY A MINUS (-) AND THEN AN EQUAL SIGN.
VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS AND MISSING DATA SYMBOLS ARE DEFINED AS BEFORE,
HOWEVER, WHEN SPECIFYING MISSING DATA SYMBOLS FOR RANGES OF VARIABLES,
ALL VARIABLES IN THE RANGE MUST HAVE THE SAME MODE.  TO ELIMINATE THE
PROBLEM OF TWO VARIABLES HAVING THE SAME NAME, NAMES DEFINED IN RANGES
MUST CONTAIN 1 OR 2 QUESTION MARKS (?). STARTING WITH THE FIRST VARIABLE
IN THE LIST THE NUMBER 1 WILL BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE QUESTION MARKS, A
NUMBER 2 WILL BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE QUESTION MARKS IN THE SECOND
VARIABLE, ETC.  EXAMPLE:
.SKIP 1

THE USER SHOULD RESPOND WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN OR A CONTROL Z (_^Z).
IF THE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE VARIABLES HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO
AN ASCII FILE PREVIOUSLY AND ARE LOCATED UNDER THE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER
NUMBER BANK IS BEING RUN FROM, THE USER MAY INDICATE THE FILE IS TO BE
USED BY TYPING @ AND THE NAME OF THE FILE.  WHEN FINISHED PROCESSING 
THOSE NAMES, THE USER MAY MAKE CHANGES, ACCESS A DIFFERENT FILE, OR
INDICATE THE PROGRAM IS TO PROCEED BY TYPING A CARRIAGE RETURN OR
CONTROL Z (_^Z).

SEPARATE BANK FILES.  THE BANK WHICH IS PRESENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION
(THE BANK INDICATED IN THE MOST RECENT RESPONSE TO "BANK?" CALLED HERE
THE RESIDENT BANK) WILL HAVE THE BANK SPECIFIED IN THE BANK SWITCH
(UPDATE BANK) INCORPORATED INTO IT.  WHEN THE MERGE IS COMPLETED, THE
UPDATE BANK WILL BE UNCHANGED, BUT THE RESIDENT BANK WILL HAVE BEEN
MODIFIED TO INCLUDE DATA LOCATED IN BOTH BANKS.  IF A VARIABLE EXISTS
FOR BOTH BANKS WHICH HAS THE SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT MODES, THE MODE OF 
THE RESIDENT BANK WILL BE USED.  IF A MATCH SWITCH IS NOT SPECIFIED IN A
MERGE COMMAND, THE UPDATE BANK WILL BE APPENDED TO THE RESIDENT BANK.
.SKIP 1

AN OBSERVATION OF THE RESIDENT BANK IF THE TWO OBSERVATIONS HAVE THE
SAME VALUES FOR ALL THE VARIABLES LISTED IN THE MATCH SWITCH.
OBSERVATIONS IN THE RESIDENT BANK WHICH CANNOT BE MATCHED TO AN
OBSERVATION IN THE UPDATE BANK WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED.  OBSERVATIONS
IN THE UPDATE BANK WHICH HAVE NO MATCH WILL BE APPENDED OR ADDED TO THE
END OF THE RESIDENT BANK.  DATA IN THE RESIDENT BANK WILL REMAIN IN ITS

THE VARIABLE IS TO BE COMPARED WITH.  THE VARIABLE MAY BE SPECIFIED BY
ITS NAME OR NUMBER.  THE  RELATIONSHIP IS ENTERED BY USING THE
SYMBOLS:##> (GREATER THAN), < (LESS THAN), AND = (EQUAL TO). TWO SYMBOLS
MAY BE COMBINED FORMING A NEW ONE AS WITH GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
(#>=#), OR NOT EQUAL (#<>#). THE VALUE TO BE COMPARED AGAINST MUST MATCH
IN MODE WITH THE VARIABLE BEING COMPARED, THUS ALPHA VALUES MUST BE
ENCLOSED IN QUOTES. IF THE RELATIONSHIP IS AN EQUAL (=), UP TO 20 VALUES
MAY BE ENTERED SEPARATED BY COMMAS. IF THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE MATCHES
ANY OF VALUES IN THE SELECT, THEN THE SELECT HAS BEEN SATISFIED.  IF IT
IS NECESSARY TO "OR" TOGETHER TWO SELECTS, THE  FIRST IS FOLLOWED BY A
SEMICOLON AND THEN THE SECOND WITHOUT THE "SELECT:".  IF EITHER PORTION
OF THE SELECT IS TRUE, THEN THE SELECT IS SATISFIED. UP TO 20 SELECT
SWITCHES MAY BE ENTERED FOR EACH INSTRUCTION.  IN OPERATION, EACH
OBSERVATION FOR THE VARIABLE SPECIFIED IN THE SELECT SWITCH IS COMPARED

MORE INSTRUCTIONS.  THE INSTRUCTIONS HAVE THE SAME FORM AS THOSE ENTERED
ON THE TERMINAL, EXCEPT THE ALTMODE ($), INDICATING THE END OF AN
INSTRUCTION, MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN <CR>.  A COMMAND FILE
IS EXECUTED IN BANK BY ENTERING AN AT SIGN (@) AND THE NAME OF THE

READINESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS. COMMAND FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME AREA
FROM WHICH THE BANK PROGRAM IS BEING RUN.  INSTRUCTIONS IN THE DISK FILE
ARE READ AND EXECUTED UNTIL AN END OF FILE IS ENCOUNTERED, AT WHICH TIME
THE TERMINAL BECOMES THE SOURCE FOR NEW INSTRUCTIONS.  WHILE EXECUTING
A COMMAND FILE, MOST OUTPUT TO THE TERMINAL WILL BE ELIMINATED,
EXCEPTIONS ARE THE "TYPE" COMMAND, "REPLACE" COMMAND, ERROR NOTICES,

DESCRIPTION:##THE "FOR" OPTION WORKS IN A LOOP FASHION REPEATING A SET
OF INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL A LIST HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED.  IN THIS RESPECT IT
RESEMBLES BOTH THE "FOR" STATEMENT IN BASIC AND THE "DO LOOP" IN
FORTRAN.  THE CORRECT FORM FOR USING THE FOR OPTION IS THE WORD FOR, THE
INDEX, AN EQUAL SIGN, AND A LIST OF VALUES THE INDEX WILL ASSUME.  ON
THE LINES FOLLOWING THE FOR WILL BE INSTRUCTIONS TO BANK.  EACH
INSTRUCTION CAN ONLY BE ONE LINE LONG, AND SHOULD BE TERMINATED BY A
CARRIAGE RETURN, NOT AN ALTMODE.  FOLLOWING THE SET OF INSTRUCTIONS IS
AN ALTMODE, INDICATING TO BANK TO BEGIN EXECUTION.  THE "FOR" OPTION
OPERATES BY FIRST CREATING A COMMAND FILE NAMED "BNKPG.DAT" AND THEN
AUTOMATICALLY ENTERING IT TO BE EXECUTED.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
THE INDEX OF THE FOR IS A SINGLE DIGIT POSITIVE NUMBER (1-9) ENCLOSED IN
BRACKETS ([]).  THE LIST IS COMPOSED OF UP TO 100 VALUES SEPARATED BY
COMMAS, EACH VALUE BEING ALPHANUMERIC (ENCLOSED IN QUOTES), NUMERIC, OR
JUST A STRING OF CHARACTERS.  VALUES MAY AT MOST BE TEN CHARACTERS LONG
WITH NO EMBEDDED COMMAS (,).  IF THE VALUES ARE INTEGERS AND SEQUENTIAL,
THEN A RANGE MAY BE INDICATED BY TYPING THE EXTREMES OF THE RANGE
SEPARATED BY A MINUS (-).  THE INDEX SPECIFIED IN THE FOR STATEMENT MAY
BE INSERTED THROUGHOUT THE INSTRUCTIONS.  ONE AT A TIME EACH VALUE IN
THE LIST WILL BE SUBSTITUTED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE INDEX, AND THE
INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE EXECUTED.  WHEN FINISHED, THE PROGRAM WILL RETURN
WITH A QUESTION MARK INDICATING ITS READINESS TO ACCEPT NEW
INSTRUCTIONS.
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 5
FORS MAY BE NESTED AS WITH FORTRAN OR BASIC, HOWEVER, ALL FORS MUST
APPEAR BEFORE THE FIRST INSTRUCTION, AND EACH FOR WILL REFERENCE ALL THE
INSTRUCTIONS.  SYNTAX CHECKING OF INSTRUCTIONS IS NOT PERFORMED IN THE
"FOR" OPTION.  THE FORM OF THE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SCRUTINIZED ONLY
AFTER EXECUTION HAS COMMENCED.  INSTRUCTIONS IN A FOR STATEMENT MAY NOT
CONTAIN CALLS TO COMMAND FILES.
