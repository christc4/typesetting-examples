^&0.1###^INTRODUCTION\&
.SKIP 1
^F^O^C^A^L IS AN ONLINE, CONVERSATIONAL, INTERPRETIVE LANGUAGE FOR THE
^D^I^G^I^T^A^L FAMILY OF COMPUTERS.
^IT IS DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS, ENGINEERS, AND SCIENTISTS SOLVE NUMERICAL PROBLEMS.
^THE LANGUAGE CONSISTS OF SHORT, EASY-TO-LEARN, IMPERATIVE ^ENGLISH STATEMENTS.
^MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS ARE TYPED IN STANDARD NOTATION.
^F^O^C^A^L PUTS THE FULL CALCULATING POWER AND SPEED OF THE COMPUTER
AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
^F^O^C^A^L IS AN EASY WAY OF SIMULATING MATHEMATICAL MODELS, PLOTTING
CURVES, HANDLING SETS OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
IN N-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS, AND
MUCH MORE.
.SKIP 1
^F^O^C^A^L-10 PROGRAMS AND DATA CAN BE READ FROM OR WRITTEN ON
ANY DEVICE - SEE SECTION 4.
.SKIP 1
^F^O^C^A^L-10 CAN CALL SUBROUTINES WRITTEN IN OTHER LANGUAGES -
SEE SECTION 14.
.SKIP 1
^THE BEST WAY TO LEARN THE ^F^O^C^A^L LANGUAGE IS TO
SIT AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL AND TRY THE COMMANDS,
STARTING WITH A FEW OF THE EXAMPLES
IN THIS MANUAL.

MEMORY, ALL STANDARD FUNCTIONS ARE RETAINED AUTOMATICALLY.
.SKIP 1
^IN GENERAL ^F^O^C^A^L-10 LANGUAGE FEATURES ARE MORE EXTENSIVE
THAN THOSE ON SMALLER COMPUTERS (SECTION 12), AND THE USER
SHOULD TAKE CARE TO AVOID CERTAIN OF THEM IF HE WILL WANT HIS
PROGRAM TO RUN ELSEWHERE.
^HOWEVER, ALMOST ALL ^F^O^C^A^L PROGRAMS

^AT TIMES IT IS USEFUL FOR A ^F^O^C^A^L PROGRAM TO PAUSE FOR A WHILE
DURING EXECUTION. ^THE ^F^H^I^B^E^R FUNCTION MAY BE USED TO DO THIS BY SPECIFYING THE LENGTH OF PAUSE AS THE ARGUMENT (IN MILLISECONDS).
^FOR EXAMPLE A FIVE-SECOND PAUSE MAY BE INTRODUCED BY THE ^F^O^C^A^L COMMAND
^X#^F^H^I^B^E^R(5000).
^THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF HIBERNATING TOO, SUCH AS WAITING FOR CERTAIN EVENTS TO OCCUR, AND DETAILS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE ^H^I^B^E^R MONITOR ^U^U^O.
^F^H^I^B^E^R ACCEPTS AN ARGUMENT WHICH IS TREATED AS A SIGNED 36-BIT INTEGER.
 ^THE 36-BIT NUMBER SO FORMED IS USED IN AN ACCUMULATOR FOR THE ^H^I^B^E^R ^U^U^O.
^FOR EXAMPLE ^X#^F^H^I^B^E^R(5000+2_^21) WILL SLEEP FOR 5 SECONDS OR UNTIL A CHARACTER IS TYPED ON THE CONTROLLING TERMINAL - WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.
^AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, ^X#^F^H^I^B^E^R(10000-2_^(35)) WILL CAUSE AN IMMEDIATE SWAP-OUT AND A PAUSE FOR 10 SECONDS.
^IF ^F^O^C^A^L IS RUNNING UNDER A MONITOR LACKING THE ^H^I^B^E^R ^U^U^O,
^F^O^C^A^L USES THE ^S^L^E^E^P ^U^U^O,
AND THE ^F^H^I^B^E^R ARGUMENT IS THE NUMBER OF SECONDS TO SLEEP, MODULO 4096.
.SKIP 1
^THE VALUE RETURNED BY THE ^F^H^I^B^E^R FUNCTION GIVES THE STATUS OF THE TERMINAL CONTROLLING ^F^O^C^A^L.
^IF THE TERMINAL'S INPUT BUFFER IS EMPTY, ^F^H^I^B^E^R RETURNS ZERO,
BUT OTHERWISE IT RETURNS 1.0.
^THIS FEATURE IS USEFUL WHEN YOU DON'T WANT YOUR PROGRAM TO HANG
UP IN "INPUT-WAIT" STATE, AND CAN ALSO BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER
THE ^F^H^I^B^E^R SLEEP WAS WOKEN BY THE TELETYPE OR NOT, IF YOU USED THOSE PARTICULAR WAKE BITS IN THE ^F^H^I^B^E^R ARGUMENT.
^IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DUE TO CERTAIN IDIOSYNCRASIES OF THE ^H^I^B^E^R ^U^U^O IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO INCLUDE ^X#^F^H^I^B^E^R(1) AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PROGRAM TO REMOVE A SPURIOUS WAKE-UP LATER ON.

A POWERFUL INTERPRETER IN A MINIMAL CORE SIZE.

^&16.0##^SPEED OF ^F^O^C^A^L\&
.SKIP 2
^THERE ARE MANY FACTORS GOVERNING THE SPEED OF EXECUTION OF A ^F^O^C^A^L PROGRAM.
^THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE IS THAT THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS
STORED IN SOURCE FORM, \I.\E. AS STRINGS OF ^A^S^C^I^I CHARACTERS
MAKING UP THE LINES OF THE PROGRAM.
^AS THE PROGRAM IS EXECUTED, ^F^O^C^A^L EXAMINES EACH LETTER OF THE
PROGRAM TEXT, DECIDING WHAT MEANING TO GIVE TO EACH LETTER, AND THEN
DOING WHATEVER IS REQUIRED.
^FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE LINE CONTAINED "^S^E^T ^X= 0", ^F^O^C^A^L
WOULD FIRST FIND THE "^S", DETERMINE THAT IT WAS THEREFORE A "^S^E^T"
COMMAND, AND MOVE THE SCANNING POINTER FORWARD PAST THE "^E" AND "^T"
UNTIL IT FOUND THE SPACE.
^THEN IT WOULD GO TO THE "^SYMBOL-FIND" ROUTINE WHICH WOULD FIND
THE "^X", DETERMINE THAT IT WAS NOT INDEXED, AND ENSURE THAT IT WAS
FOLLOWED BY "=" AND SKIP THE "=".
^A CALL TO THE "^E^V^A^L" ROUTINE WOULD THEN SKIP THE SPACE, EVALUATE THE
ZERO, AND RETURN TO THE "^S^E^T" ROUTINE WHICH WOULD STORE THE ANSWER.
^THE ONLY REMAINING THING TO DO WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT THE LINE IS TERMINATED
CORRECTLY.
^THUS IT APPEARS THAT SINCE ^F^O^C^A^L IS AN "INTERPRETER", TIME COULD
BE SAVED BY OMITTING THE "^E" AND "^T", AND THE SPACE BEFORE THE ZERO.

.SKIP 1
^DEPENDING ON MEMORY SPEED, CONFIGURATION ETC., ^F^O^C^A^L-10 WILL SHOW
ABOUT 75 MICROSECONDS PER CHARACTER (^K^I-10) OR 125 MICROSECONDS
PER CHARACTER (^K^A-10).
^SINCE ^F^O^C^A^L-10 HAS A SPECIAL CAPABILITY TO SKIP SPACES QUICKLY,

^&16.2##^SPEED OF ^LINE-FINDING\&
.SKIP 2
^INTERPRETERS SUCH AS ^F^O^C^A^L-10 HAVE VARIOUS METHODS OF STORING
PROGRAM LINES.
^ONE METHOD COULD BE TO STORE ALL PROGRAM LINES WITH THEIR LINE NUMBERS
IN THE TEXT STORAGE AREA.
^IN SUCH A CASE, THE LINE-FINDING ROUTINE WOULD NEED TO SCAN ALL TEXT,
SEARCHING FOR END-OF-LINE FOLLOWED BY THE LINE NUMBER.
^F^O^C^A^L-10, HOWEVER, STORES THE LINE NUMBERS IN A SEPARATE TABLE,
IN ORDER OF LINE NUMBER, WITH A SIMILAR TABLE OF POINTERS TO
THE LINE ITSELF.
^IN FINDING A LINE, THEN, ^F^O^C^A^L-10 MUST FIRST SCAN THE TABLE AND
THEN USE THE POINTER TO GET TO THE LINE ITSELF.
^SPEEDS ARE MEASURED BY FINDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
.SKIP 1

.SKIP 1
^TYPICAL TIMES FOR ^F^O^C^A^L-10 ARE 18 - 30 MICROSECONDS PER LINE
SCANNED OVER.
^THE TIME DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THE TABLE OF LINE
NUMBERS.
^OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE QUICKER TO FIND LOW-NUMBERED
LINES IN ^F^O^C^A^L-10, BUT IN ALL CASES IT WOULD BE FASTER THAN
AN INTERPRETER WHICH DID NOT HAVE A LINE TABLE.
