The student resume system described in this manual was developed at
the Yale School of Management for the automatic assembly of resume
books for each class of the Masters Degree in Public and Private
Management (MPPM) program.  This manual describes the administrative
procedures needed to prepare for and process the resumes.  A separate
manual is available which instructs the students in how to enter and
edit their resumes.

INTRODUCTION

.skip.test page 3
The RESUME program is a simple line editor and word processor designed
specially for the production of resumes by the students enrolled at
the school.  The students use the RESUME program to enter their resumes
into the computer.  They then run the program again as many times as
are necessary to revise their resumes.  When all of students have
completed their resumes, the resumes can be automatically collected
together and typed ready to be photocopied and assembled into the resume
book.
.skip.test page 3
Each resume can be limited to just a single page or can be several
pages in length.  The student types as few or as many words on a line
as is convenient.  The words will be accumulated to form lines of
approximately equal length in the resume.  The student's name and local
and permanent addresses appear at the top of the resume.  The rest
of the resume is divided into sections which describe such things as
the student's education and work experience.  Lines are ruled between
the sections and the section names appear in dark lettering at the
upper left corners of the sections.  Selected words can also be darkened
or underlined.  Lists can be included in which each item is shifted
slightly to the right of the ordinary left margin and is marked with
a bullet.
.skip.test page 3
The RESUME program is usually liked best by students who have had little
or no previous computer experience.  They find that they can use the
program even without any instruction in its use.  All of the commands
which the student must issue to enter a resume or edit it consist of
short English language words.  The student can type a question mark
for a complete description of what the program expects at any point.
If the student makes a mistake and issues a command which would be
likely to damage the resume, then the program will always tell the
student the possible consequences and will request confirmation that
this really is what the student wants.
.skip.test page 3
A student who has done no advance preparation usually takes from 3
to 4 hours, spread over several sessions, to compose a new resume using
the program.  Considerably less time is required to enter the resume
if the student can be convinced to prepare a rough draft of the resume
before first using the computer.  Each student can run the RESUME
program from a separate account or all of the students in a class can
share a single account.  When many students share a single account,
the passwords used to keep their resumes separate from the rest can
either be assigned to the students before they run the program or can
be chosen by the students themselves when they first run the program.
.skip.test page 3
One or more members of the administrative office staff must be available
to set up the central account in which the resumes are stored, to help
the students enter and modify their resumes, to proofread and correct
the resumes after the students have finished them, and to prepare the
typed copies of the resumes which will be photocopied to produce the
resulting resume book.  The necessary administrative functions are
enabled for certain accounts for particular classes.  The RESUME program
can be run by the administrator to modify any resume which has been
finished by the student.  The administrator cannot modify a resume
which has not yet been finished by the student.  The student resume
system includes programs which can be run by the administrator to change
the state of the resumes, to change the passwords by which the students
access the resumes, and to collect together the final versions of the
resumes so that these can be typed.
.skip.test page 3
The student resume system was developed on a DECsystem20 computer and
has been used over the course of 2 years.  During this time, the RESUME
program has been run by nearly 600 students.  The programs in the
package can be run from practically any type of terminal.  The logic
in the programs is written entirely in machine independent FORTRAN.
There are, of course, sections of the programs which are machine
dependent.  These have been localized as much as possible and should
be easily convertible to other computer systems.  A version for the
DECsystem10 computer is included.

OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE RESUME COLLECTION PROCESS
.center
------- ----------- -- --- ------ ---------- -------
.skip.test page 3
The resumes which have been entered by the students are stored in a
central account which is separate from the accounts from which the
students run the RESUME program.  This central account is used to store
the resumes for all classes.  If each student has an individual computer
account, then the names of the files in which the resumes are stored
can be based upon the numbers by which the computer identifies these
accounts.  If several students share a single account, then the names
of the files are based upon the passwords which the students type in
after starting the program.  Passwords are not needed if the students
have their own individual accounts, but the administrator can still
require that the students use passwords.
.skip.test page 3
When a student runs the RESUME program, the program checks whether
the file containing the current version of the resume exists in the
central account.  If the file exists, then the current version of the
resume is read from this file.  If the resume has not been submitted,
then the RESUME program will immediately ask the question "WHAT NEXT?"
and the student can proceed to modify the resume or to submit it.  The
resume cannot be modified if it has already been submitted, but the
student can still get a copy of the finished resume.
.skip.test page 3
If the file does not exist and the student is not choosing a password
to gain access to the resume, then it is assumed that this particular
student has not run the program before.  If the file does not exist
and the student is choosing a password, then the program will ask
whether the student really wants to start a new resume.  This is merely
a polite way of asking whether the student made an error while typing
the password.
.skip.test page 3
The student's name is the first thing which the program will ask for
which will appear in the resume.  The program then requests, line by
line, the student's address and list of phone numbers.  The program
will ask whether a permanent address is to be included in the resume.
If a permanent address is to be included, then this address and the
associated phone numbers are also requested line by line.
.skip.test page 3
After the addresses have all been entered, the program reads a
description of the degree program in which the student is enrolled
from a file which is used for all of the students in the same class.
The text in this file is in exactly the same format as the text which
the student can enter.  The description of the current degree program
is appended to the resume and is then displayed to the student.  The
program then asks for the student to type in anything else which is
to be in the EDUCATION section.  The student presses the RETURN key
an extra time when the EDUCATION section has been completed.  The
program then asks the "WHAT NEXT?"  question.  At this point, the
student can modify the name, the addresses or the EDUCATION section
or can create new sections.  If the file which describes the current
degree program cannot be read, then the program does not ask for the
completion of the EDUCATION section, but instead immediately asks the
"WHAT NEXT?"  question after the name and addresses have been entered.
.skip.test page 3
Each time the student exits from the program, the current version of
the resume is saved in the central account.  Finally, when the student
is satisfied with the contents of the resume, the student answers the
"WHAT NEXT?"  question by typing the word SUBMIT.  This marks the resume
as being ready to be included in the resume collection.  Once the resume
has been submitted, it cannot be modified further by the student.  If
a student submits a resume, but later finds a mistake, the administrator
either can modify the resume using the RESUME program or can use the
RSMADM program to unsubmit the resume.  RSMADM stands for RESume
ADMinistrator.  If the administrator unsubmits the resume, then the
student will have to correct the resume and submit the resume again.
.skip.test page 3
A number which indicates the state of the resume is stored along with
the text of the resume in the file in the central account.  The resume
progresses through the following series of states on its way to being
incorporated into the resume book.  If the resume collection is to
be typed rather than typeset, then the resume would never reach the
final TRANSMITTED state.  In general, the resume progresses through
these states in the order shown.  However, whenever the administrator
uses the RESUME program to edit a resume, the resume is placed in the
EDITED state even if it was in one of the later states.  It is assumed
that the resume would not have been edited unless an error was
discovered in it, and it would therefore be proofed and either typed
or transmitted again.  The word proofed here is taken to mean that
the reformatted version of the resume has been written into a file
which can then be printed or typed.  The word transmitted is taken
to mean that a specially formatted version of the file containing the
resume has been copied into an account which can be accessed by the
printing service.

.left margin 14.indent -14.test page 3
DRAFT#########The student has used the RESUME program to create a new
resume, or to modify it, but the student has not yet submitted the
resume to be included in the resume collection.
.skip.test page 3.indent -14
SUBMITTED#####The student has used the RESUME program to indicate that
the resume is ready to be included in the resume collection.
.skip.test page 3.indent -14
SUBMIT+PROOF##The administrator has used the RSMADM program to produce
a paper copy of a resume which has been submitted by the student.  The
state of the resume does not change if the administrator produces a
paper copy of a resume which is in any state other than SUBMITTED or
EDITED.
.skip.test page 3.indent -14
EDITED########The administrator has used the RESUME program to modify
a resume which was in any state other than the original unsubmitted
DRAFT state.  The administrator cannot use the RESUME program to change
a resume which has not been submitted, although the administrator could
first use the RSMADM program to submit the resume and would then be
free to edit it.
.skip.test page 3.indent -14
EDIT+PROOF####The administrator has used the RSMADM program to obtain
a paper copy of a resume which was in the EDITED state.  Obtaining
a paper copy of a resume which is in any state other than SUBMITTED
or EDITED does not change the state of the resume.
.skip.test page 3.indent -14
TRANSMITTED###The administrator has used the RSMADM program to copy
the resume into the printing service account.  The resume remains in
the TRANSMITTED state unless it is subsequently edited in which case
it drops back to the EDITED state.  It is assumed that it will then
be proofed and transmitted again.
.skip.test page 3.INDENT -14
REPLACED######The administrator has used the RSMADM program to copy
the resume into a new file which has a different name.  The file having
the original name is then placed in the REPLACED state.  Files are
copied with different names when the students must access them from
different individual accounts, as might happen from one year to the
next, or when the students want to change the passwords by which the
resumes are accessed.  This state is not part of the regular progression
from the DRAFT state to the TRANSMITTED state.  Files in the REPLACED
state are subsequently ignored by the RESUME program.  For most
purposes, the file can be thought of as having been deleted.  If a
student selects a password which maps to the same number as that of
a replaced file, then the new file will replace the original file when
the student exits from the program.
.skip.test page 3.INDENT -14
BLOCKED#######The administrator has used the RSMADM program to block
access to the resume.  This state is not part of the regular progression
from the DRAFT state to the TRANSMITTED state.  The students cannot
gain access to resumes which are in the BLOCKED state.  Students who
have not used the computer prior to running the RESUME program often
do not understand that there can be several levels of access each
controlled by separate passwords.  If the students share a common
computer account, then the resume having the same password as that
used for gaining access to the account should be blocked so that several
students don't each try to use this common password inside the RESUME
program and in the process destroy each others resumes.
.left margin 0
.skip.test page 3
When some or all of the resumes have been submitted by the students,
the RSMADM program should be run to produce a file which contains the
reformatted resumes which can be printed on the fast printer.  This
will change the state of these resumes from SUBMITTED to SUBMIT+PROOF.
The RSMADM program can only be run from accounts which are listed in
the RESUME.WHO file as being used by the administrator.
.skip.test page 3
The following is a typical dialog which would be used to proof the
submitted resumes.

.skip.fill.test page 3
If it is desired that the resumes be processed in the alphabetical
order of the students names, then the RSMADM program will have to be
run twice.  The RSMADM program would be run the first time to write
the student names into a file named RESUME.LST by selecting function
1.  Then the RSMSRT program would be run to sort the names and write
them into a new file named RESUME.SRT.  Finally, the RSMADM program
would be run a second time to process the resumes in the preselected
order.
.skip.fill.test page 3
The RSMADM program will write the reformatted resumes into a file named
RESUME.PRF which should then be printed on the fast printer.  If errors
are seen in the resumes, then the RESUME program can be used by the
administrator to edit the resumes.  The RESUME program can be used
to modify any submitted resume if the RESUME program is run from an
account which is listed in the RESUME.WHO file as an account which
is used by the administrator.  The administrator will be asked to
specify the class and student number identifying the resume.  The
student number can be obtained by running the RSMADM program and asking
for a list of all resumes for the particular class.
.skip.test page 3
If the students have chosen their own passwords, then the student
numbers are 6 digit numbers based upon the passwords and the
administrator can use either the numbers or the passwords to identify
the resumes when running the RESUME and RSMADM programs.  If the
administrator assigned the combination of a number and a password to
each student, then the student number is the number assigned by the
administrator.  If the students are running from their own accounts
on either the DECsystem10 or the DECsystem20 computers and not using
passwords, then the student numbers are the DECsystem10 programmer
numbers.  On the DECsystem20, the administrator can issue a TRANSLATE
command to obtain the programmer number.  The programmer number is
the second number which is enclosed in square brackets in the response
made by the computer.  The TRANSLATE command would be similar to the
following.
.skip
TRANSLATE PS:<S.E.SMITH>
.skip.test page 3
The things which the RESUME program does differently when run by the
administrator rather than by the students are listed below.
.skip.test page 3.left margin 5.indent -4
1.##The administrator can edit any submitted resume.  The administrator
cannot edit a resume which has not yet been finished by the student.
.skip.test page 3.indent -4
2.##The administrator is asked the "WHAT NEXT?"  question immediately
after the EDIT command has performed a single modification of the line.
The administrator is not asked if editing of the line has been completed
since it is assumed that only minor changes will be made.
.skip.test page 3.indent -4
3.##The SAVE, EXIT and SUBMIT commands are identical when issued by
the administrator.  All of these commands cause the changes to the
current resume to be saved.  The resume will be marked as being in
the EDITED state.  The administrator is then asked to select another
resume to be edited.  If the administrator issues a PAPER command,
the program will mark the resume as being in the EDITED state, will
save the changes made by the administrator, will write a copy of the
resume into a file named RESUME.DOC which can be typed or printed later,
and will then exit.
.skip.test page 3.indent -4
4.##The CANCEL command discards all changes which the administrator
has made to the current resume, but does not destroy the original
version.  The resume is not placed into the EDITED state.  The
administrator is then asked to select another resume to be edited.
.left margin 0
.skip.test page 3
If the administrator runs the RSMADM program to proof the edited
resumes, then the resumes are changed from the EDITED state to the
EDIT+PROOF state.  If the RESUME program is used to correct any
additional errors, then these resumes drop back from the EDIT+PROOF
state to the EDITED state.
.skip.test page 3
Finally, when the resumes are seen to be correct, the RSMADM program
is run a final time to transmit the resumes.  The RSMADM program can
either transmit individual resumes identified by student number or
password, or can transmit all of the resumes for a particular class
or classes which are in a particular state or states.  It will probably
be desired to transmit all of the resumes which are in the SUBMIT+PROOF
and EDIT+PROOF states.  The resumes should be transmitted sorted by
the students' names.  As described earlier, transmitting the resumes
sorted by names is a 3 stage process.  First the RSMADM program must
be run to produce a file containing a listing of the students and the
numbers identifying their resumes.  Then the RSMSRT program must be
run to sort the names and write these into the RESUME.SRT file.
Finally, the RSMADM program is run again to process the resumes in
the preselected order.  The files which are written into the printing
service account will be given names which are identical to the numbers
which appear at the left ends of the lines containing the students'
names in the RESUME.SRT file produced by the RSMSRT program.
.skip.test page 3
If individual resumes selected by student number or password are being
transmitted, then the administrator will be asked for the numbers which
are to be used as the names of the files which will be placed into
the printing service account.  If the resumes being transmitted are
corrected versions of resumes which have already been transmitted,
then probably the numbers at the left ends of the lines containing
the students' names in the RESUME.SRT file should be used so that the
files will be assigned the same names as when the resumes were
transmitted earlier.

If the resume book is to be photocopied directly from the copy typed
on the letter quality typewriter, then the procedure is much simpler.
When all of the resumes are ready to be printed, the RSMADM program
is run to produce a proof of the entire collection.  In response to
the various questions asked by the RSMADM program, CONTINUOUS format
with bolding for the TYPEWRITER is chosen.  The file is then typed
on the letter quality typewriter.  If errors are detected in some
resumes, then these are corrected using the RESUME program, and the
RSMADM program is run again later to produce proofs for those which
are in the EDITED state.

.skip.test page 3
The student resume system contains the following 5 programs.
.skip.test page 3.left margin 8.indent -8
RESUME##This is the program which is run by the students to enter and
edit their resumes.  This is the only program in the resume package
which the students can run.  The administrator can use the program
to edit any resume which has been submitted for inclusion in the resume
collection.  The administrator cannot use the RESUME program to edit
a resume which has not been submitted or to input a new resume.
.skip.test page 3.indent -8
RSMADM##This is the program which the administrator uses to perform
all routine manipulations of the resumes other than the editing of
the resumes which is done using the RESUME program itself.  The RSMADM
program cannot be run by the students.  The program can process resumes
selected by class, by state and by date of entry or can process
individually selected resumes.  The RSMADM program can be used to list
the resumes, to submit or unsubmit the resumes, to produce proofs or
final copies of the resume book or to change the numbers and the
passwords used to access the resumes.  It can also be used to copy
a special version of the resumes to another account which can then
be accessed by the printing service.
.skip.test page 3.indent -8
RSMMIX##This is a program which can be run by the administrator to
process the resumes before the students return to modify the resumes
which they entered the previous year.  The RSMMIX program cannot be
run by the students.  It converts the second and subsequent letters
in words which are formed entirely of capital letters to small letters.
It is recommended that the students' names, company names, school names
and section names be entirely capitalized if the resumes are typed,
but only have the first letters of the words capitalized if the resumes
are typeset.  The RSMMIX program helps in the conversion of resumes
which were formatted for typing the previous year so that these can
now be typeset.  The RSMMIX program reads a file named RESUME.WRD from
the resume storage account which contains a list of words which are
to be kept entirely capitalized.  If a word does not appear in the
RESUME.WRD file, then it will be converted.  Of course, whether some
words are converted will depend upon context, and the students will
have to correct the capitalization of these.
.skip.test page 3.indent -8
RSMPSW##This program can be used to assign passwords selected at random
from any text file to the students.
.skip.test page 3.indent -8
RSMSRT##This is a program which the administrator uses to sort the
list of resumes produced by the RSMADM program into alphabetical order
based upon the students' names.  The RSMSRT program reads a file named
RESUME.LST from the account in which it is run, and writes a sorted
list into a file named RESUME.SRT in the same account.  The file
containing the sorted list can be typed for use by the office staff,
or can be read by the RSMADM program to allow it to process these
resumes in alphabetical order.  The RSMSRT program is not protected
from use by the students.

COMPUTER ACCOUNTS

.skip.test page 3
The following accounts must be established in order to use the student
resume system.
.skip.test page 3.left margin 5
.indent -2
1#account in which the resumes for all of the students in all of the
classes are stored.  The resumes for different classes are kept separate
by the use of the class numbers as part of the names of the files.
The resumes for different classes cannot be stored in separate accounts.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
1#or more administrative accounts.  If 1 person is acting as the
administrator for all of the classes, then a single account should
be used.  If there is a different administrator for each class, then
each should use a separate account and each of these accounts should
be validated for use by the administrator for only 1 class.
Instructions for validating accounts for use by the administrator are
given later in this manual.  There can be overlap here.  Typically,
an account used by someone on the computer services staff would be
validated for use by the administrator for all possible classes, but
the accounts being used by the people editing the resumes would be
validated only for use by the administrator for a small range of
classes.

1#account from which all of the students in a particular class can
run the RESUME program.  There should be 1 of these shared accounts
for each class.  Alternatively, if the students have their own
individual accounts, then they can run from their separate accounts.
.left margin 0
.skip.test page 3
The minimum number of accounts which should be available for the use
of the student resume package would be 1 more than the number of
classes.  There would then be 1 account to be used by all the students
in a single class and 1 account to be used both by the administrator
and for storage of the resumes for all of the classes.
.skip.test page 3
With a lot of care on the part of everyone, a single account could
actually be used for all of these purposes.  The RESUME.WHO file would
then have to be changed whenever any administrative functions were
needed.  The RESUME.WHO file would have to be changed back again when
the students were allowed to run the RESUME program.  The use of just
a single account would also mean that the files in which the resumes
are stored would be visible to the students.  The most obvious danger
which would result from the storage of the resumes in the account which
is used by the students is that any student could accidentally or
intentionally delete the files containing the resumes of all of the
students.  Experience with student exercises in which the files are
stored in the accounts used by the students has demonstrated that such
destruction of the files is likely.  Also, processing of the resumes
for just a single class would be difficult if the students from several
classes shared the same account, since a single account cannot be used
for the entry of resumes having different class numbers.

.skip.test page 4.indent -12
SCHOOL.XXX##contains the description of the degree program in which
the student is currently enrolled.  XXX represents the class number.
If the class number is less than 100, then extra zeros are inserted
at the left to obtain 3 digits.  The contents of this file are inserted
into the resume after the name and address sections when the RESUME

being used to run the program.  If this number is less then 100000,
then extra zeros are inserted at the left to obtain 6 digits.  These
files are written into the account being used by the students when
the students select the PAPER command in the RESUME program.

inserted at the left to obtain 6 digits.  XXX represents the class
number.  If the class number is less than 100, then extra zeros are
inserted at the left to obtain 3 digits.  Each resume is contained
in a separate file.  These files are written into the resume storage
account when the students select the commands EXIT, PAPER, SAVE and
SUBMIT in the RESUME program.  The files are read by the RESUME program
when it starts, by the RSMADM administrative program, and by the RSMMIX
administrative program.

RESUME.SRT##contains a list of the students and the numbers which
identify the files containing their resumes.  This list is sorted in
alphabetical order based upon the students' names.  The file is produced
by the RSMSRT program.  The RESUME.SRT file lists all of the students
listed in the RESUME.LST file, but the formats of these 2 files are
different and cannot be used interchangeably.  The RESUME.SRT file
can be typed to be used as a check-off list.  The RESUME.SRT file can
also be read by the RSMADM program to control the order in which the
resumes are to be processed.
.skip.test page 3
The procedure which is used to process the resumes in alphabetical
order based upon the students' names is first to run the RSMADM program
to select resumes by some criteria from those listed in the RESUME.DIR
file in the resume storage account, and to have the RSMADM program
write the information about these resumes into the RESUME.LST file.
Then the RSMSRT program is run to read the RESUME.LST file and to write
the RESUME.SRT file.  Finally the RSMADM program is run again to process
the resumes in the order indicated by the RESUME.SRT file.

VALIDATION OF ACCOUNTS FROM WHICH PROGRAMS ARE RUN

---------- -- -------- ---- ----- -------- --- ---

The RESUME program and the administrative programs can only be run
from accounts which are specified in a validation file which resides
in the resume storage account.  The validation file is named RESUME.WHO
and contains 1 line for each account, or for each group of accounts,
from which the programs can be run.  Lines are read from the validation
file until a line is found which exactly specifies the account from
which the program is being run or which specifies a group of accounts
of which the current account is a member.  The subsequent lines in
the validation file are ignored even if they also specify the current
account.  It is thus possible to treat a few members of a group of
accounts differently than the rest of the members of the group by
inserting lines which specify the accounts to be treated specially
before the line which specifies the rest of the group of accounts.

.skip.test page 3.fill
then the account <F.PUBLICATIONS> would be able to edit submitted
resumes for class 999 and the account <S.PUBLICATIONS> would be able
to edit submitted resumes for classes 1 through 4.  The account
<F.STAFF> could perform all administrative functions for class 999
and the account <S.STAFF> could perform all administrative functions
for classes 1 through 4.
.skip.test page 3.indent-2
=#0 through 999, allows the account to be used to run the RESUME program
to create or modify a resume.  The administrative programs cannot be
run.  NUMBER1 is taken to be the class number.  The RESUME program
works identically for all classes.  The class number appears in the
name of the file in which the resume is stored so that the resumes
for the various classes can be kept separate.  The class number also
determines from which file the description of the current degree program
is to be read and which messages are to be shown to the students.
.skip.test page 3.indent-2
=#1000 or greater, prevents running of the programs from this account.
The programs also cannot be run from accounts which do not match any
of the accounts specified in the file.  However, putting in a line
with NUMBER1=1000 can be used to block use of the programs by a subset
of a group of accounts validated by a later line.
.skip.test page 3
For example, if the file contained the lines
.skip.nofill.test page 2
1000 0 0 2 <S.O.SMITH>
   2 0 0 2 <S.O.*>
.skip.fill.test page 3
then accounts such as <S.O.JONES> and <S.O.JOHNSON> which are validated
by the second line would be able to run the RESUME program, and would
be taken to be in class 2, but the account <S.O.SMITH> would not be
able to run the program.
.skip.test page 3.indent-10
NUMBER2#=#if NUMBER1 is -1 or less so that administrative functions
are enabled for this account, then NUMBER2 specifies the lowest class
number of the resumes which can be processed by this account.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then NUMBER2 specifies
whether each student will use a separate account or whether the students
will run the RESUME program from a shared account.  If the students
run the program from a shared account, then NUMBER2 also specifies
whether they use passwords which are assigned to them or will choose
their own passwords.
.skip.test page 3
All of the accounts which are used by the students in the same class
must have identical values for NUMBER2.  If it is really desired that
some of the students in a particular academic class run from a common
account and use passwords to get into the program and that other
students in the same class use their separate accounts without issuing
passwords to get into the program (they still would have to use their
login passwords to gain access to their accounts) then these 2 groups
of students should be assigned different values of NUMBER1 and each
of these groups would need to have its own separate default education
and message files.  The reason for this is that the names of the resume
storage files are based only on the value of NUMBER1 and a second number
which represents either the password or the account.  The program
protects against ambiguity in the conversion of the password to a
number, and the account numbers are unique, but there is no protection
against the password being converted to a number which happens to also
be the account number of another student.
.skip.test page 3
For example, a student running from a shared account might choose the
letter Z as a password which would be converted to the number 26. If
the same class number were used both for students running from the
shared account and for those running from individual accounts, then
a student running the program later from an individual account for
which the account number also happened to be 26 would gain access to
the resume started by the first person.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#-1, and if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then the members
of the class are told that they are not allowed to run the RESUME
program at this time, but any messages in the file named MESAGE.XXX,
where XXX is the class number, are displayed to them before they are
kicked off.  The students will not be asked for their passwords, and
will not be able to obtain paper copies of their submitted resumes.
NUMBER1 could instead be set to 1000 to prevent the students from
running the program, but the students would then be told that they
are not authorized to run the program and no special messages would
be displayed.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#0, and if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then it is expected
that each student has a separate account.  There can only be 1 resume
associated with each of these accounts.  The student will not be asked
to supply a password to identify which resume belongs to the student.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#1, and if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then several students
can use the same account.  The student can access any resume for the
current class for which the password is known.  To create a new resume
the student merely enters a password which is not already in use.  It
is not necessary that a resume which is to be modified have been created
from the same account, only that it have been created using a password
chosen by the student from an account having the same class number.
There might, for example, be 5 accounts any of which could be used
by any of the students at any time, but all of these accounts would
need to have the same value of NUMBER2.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#2, similar to NUMBER2=1, except that the student must supply both
a number and a password which the RESUME program administrator has
assigned to the student.  This number and password combination must
appear in a file named PASWRD.XXX where XXX is the class number.  This
file must be in the resume storage account.  Each line in this file
starts with a number which must be unique to that student in the class,
followed by 1 or more spaces and then by a password to be associated
with this number.  The number must be in the range 0 through 999999
and must be composed only of the digits 0 through 9.  It is recommended
that there not be any duplication of the passwords within a class,
but such duplication will not cause the programs any difficulty.  The
password can consist of 1 or more words.  Spaces between the words
merely mark word boundaries.  It does not matter if just 1 or several
spaces appear between the words.  An exclamation mark followed by a
comment or by the student's name can appear to the right of the
password.  The following would be a typical line in the password file.
.skip
2164 sticks and stones!John Doe
.skip.test page 3
The file can be terminated by a line which starts with or contains
only an equal sign, although such a line is not necessary.  Any lines
following the line which starts with the equal sign will not be read
and will be ignored.  The student must type at least 1 space between
pairs of words, and at least 1 space must appear between the words
on the lines in the file, but the exact number of spaces is ignored.
The password can contain up to 20 characters, counting the separations
between words as 1 character each.  The passwords can be constructed
from any printing characters.  The capital and small forms of the
alphabetic letters A through Z are considered to be equivalent, both
in the file and in the password typed by the student.
.skip.test page 3.indent-10
NUMBER3#=#if NUMBER1 is -1 or less so that administrative functions
are enabled for this account, then NUMBER3 specifies the highest class
number of the resumes which can be processed by this account.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then NUMBER3 specifies
whether the final resumes will be typed on a letter quality typewriter
or will be typeset.  Most installations will select the typed option
here.  The page width and length for typeset resumes are based upon
a particular type font, and the installation will have to arrange for
insertion of the proper typesetting commands and for the shipping of
the files.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#0, and if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then the width and
length of the pages will be based on the proportions of a particular
type font.  More characters will be allowed on a line which contains
many narrow characters such as 1 or I than on lines which contain many
wide characters such as M or W.  The tables now in the program are
for the Univers (no final letter e) type font as produced on a
Mergenthaler typesetter.  These tables were obtained by measuring the
widths of the characters on existing typeset resumes.  They are not
based upon any specifications provided by the manufacturer of the
typesetter.  Conversion to another type font would be much easier if
such tables could be obtained from the manufacturer.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#1 or greater, and if NUMBER1 is in the range 0 through 999, then
NUMBER3 is the maximum number of pages which can be included in a
submitted resume which will be typed on the letter quality typewriter.
The width and length of the pages will be based on that appropriate
for typing at 12 characters per inch and 6 lines per inch on an 8 1/2
by 11 inch page.  Resumes to be included in the resume book should
be limited to a single page.  However, after the resume book has been
completed, the limit should probably be increased to 4 or 5.  Putting
in a value of over 5 would be pointless since the array space in the
program is dimensioned for a maximum of 300 lines.
.skip.test page 3.indent -10
NUMBER4#=#specifies the type of terminal which will be used by most
of the students using this account.  This specifies the general type
of display, not the particular brand or model of terminal.  If some
students use a different type of terminal, then these students will
have to specify the type of terminal which they are using each time
that they run the RESUME program.  The terminal type can be changed
either when the RESUME program asks if the student wants general
instructions or any time the program asks the "WHAT NEXT?"  question.
If NUMBER1 is -1 or less, then NUMBER4 specifies the type of terminal
which will be used by the administrator when the RESUME program is
used to edit submitted resumes.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#0, the terminal produces paper output or does not match any of the
other terminal types supported by the RESUME program.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#1, the terminal is a video terminal which scrolls the lines currently
being displayed upwards to display the new lines at the bottom and
to discard the oldest lines at the top.  The terminal cannot clear
the screen when a form feed character is issued.  The screen can display
24 lines of 80 columns each.  The RESUME program will scroll short
dialogs but will stop whenever the screen fills and wait for the student
to press the RETURN key when typing drafts or proofs of the resume
and when typing lengthy help messages.  The program will scroll the
next page of text onto the screen after the student presses the RETURN
key.
.skip.test page 3.indent -2
=#2, same as NUMBER4=1 except that the screen can be cleared by issuing
a form feed character.  The RESUME program will scroll short dialogs,

The accounts which can be used to run the programs are specified by
name on the DECsystem20.  Accounts are arranged in a tree structure
with periods separating the list of nodes.  The account names which
appear to the right of the numbers in the validation file should be
preceded by a less than sign and followed by a greater than sign
although any sequence of printing characters which does not start with
a left square bracket is also taken to be an account name.  There must
not be any blanks either between the leading less than sign and the
name of the account or within the name of the account.  The alphabetic
letters A through Z in the account names can appear in either upper
or lower case.  An asterisk can be included at the right end of the
account name if any sequence of nodes is to be allowed starting at
that point.  A period can appear between the names of the nodes to
the left and the asterisk but is not required.  In order to be matched,
the name of the account being used must include a node at the location
of the asterisk.  An account name consisting only of nodes to the left
of the location of the asterisk will not be matched.

bracket, followed by the project number, a comma, the programmer number
and a right square bracket.  Spaces can appear on either side of the
numbers and can replace the separating comma.  A question mark can
appear anywhere in either number where any digit is to be allowed.
An asterisk can appear instead of a number if any number is to be
allowed.  A comma can separate the asterisk from the other number but
is not necessary.

USING THE RSMPSW PROGRAM TO ASSIGN PASSWORDS
.center
----- --- ------ ------- -- ------ ---------
.skip.test page 3
The students can be required to use a number and a password assigned
to them by the administrator to identify themselves to the RESUME
program.  This feature is enabled by setting NUMBER2 to have the value
2 in the entry in the RESUME.WHO file for the account or accounts being
used by the students.  The instructions for validating accounts should
be consulted for additional information.
.skip.test page 3
The numbers and the passwords by which the students identify themselves
to the RESUME program must be specified by a file named PASWRD.XXX,
where XXX is the class number.  There must be one of these files in
the resume storage account for each class for which passwords are being
assigned.  Each line in this file contains a number followed by the
associated password.  An exclamation point followed by a comment can
appear to the right of the password.  The comment might consist of
the students' names to aid a visual search of the file, but the comment
is ignored by the password checker in the RESUME program.  The file
can be terminated by a line starting with an equal sign and containing
nothing else.
.skip.test page 3
Although the password file could be constructed by hand, selection
of hundreds of such passwords soon becomes a mental word association
exercise.  Provided that a file which contains a list of the student
names and any arbitrary text file containing at least several pages
of text are available, the RSMPSW program can be used to select words
at random from the text file and assign these as passwords to the
students.  Each line in the resulting file contains a number, a
password, an exclamation point and the student's name.
.skip.test page 3
The RSMPSW program also produces a second file which can be used to
insert the student's name, number and password into a form letter
telling the student how to gain access to the RESUME program.  This
file contains 2 lines for each student.  The student's name is on the
first line and the number and password are on the second line.  This
file is meant to be processed, along with a file which describes the
basic form letter, by the FROFF word processor.  An example of the
file which describes the basic form letter is shown below.
.skip.nofill.test page 13
_.open splice.loop;To:
_.splice 1.skip
You will use the following number and password to identify
yourself when you run the RESUME program.
_.skip.indent 5.splice 1.skip
This password was chosen at random from a list of common
short words.  You can type the number and the password on
the same line, or you can type the number on the first line,
and the password on the next line.
_.skip
If you have any difficulties with the program, please
contact the RESUME program administrator.
_.reset.end loop
.fill.skip.test page
The _.OPEN#SPLICE and .LOOP commands at the start of the file and the
_.RESET and .END#LOOP commands at the end merely prepare for and
terminate each form letter respectively.  The _.SPLICE 1 commands each
insert the contents of the next line from the second file produced
by the RSMPSW program at that point into the letter.
.skip.test page 3
The file of student names which is processed by the RSMPSW program
must contain only 1 name per line.  The maximum length of a single
name is 40 characters, counting each of the spaces between words.  The
names are copied into the resulting files in the order in which they
appear in the original file.  It is suggested that these names should
have been sorted in alphabetical order before they are processed by
the RSMPSW program so that a visual search can be used to locate the
entry belonging to a particular student.  It should be noted that the
RSMMIX program is not meant to be used for sorting these names.
.skip.test page 3
The RSMPSW program can extract passwords from any text file which
contains enough words so that the same password does not have to be
assigned to many students.  The RSMPSW program would operate correctly
even if this file only contained a single word, but the resulting
duplication of passwords wouldn't really be acceptable.  However, it
doesn't matter if a few of the students have the same password, since
it is only the combination of number and password which must be unique.
The lines in the file can each contain up to 80 characters.  Only words
containing from 4 to 8 letters each are used as passwords.  The
passwords can also be based upon the file named RSMPSW.DAT which is
supplied with this package.  The RSMPSW.DAT file contains 5000 different
words 4 to 8 letters in length sorted by the frequency of the appearance
of these words in a variety of text files which originally contained
over 7.5 million words.
.skip.test page 3
The RSMPSW program is able to skip over any number of initial words
in the file from which the passwords are being extracted.  The RSMPSW
program stores 250 words read from the file in a hopper.  The passwords
are selected from this hopper at random and are then discarded from
the hopper.  If only a fraction of the words in the file are being
used as passwords, then the words which are to be discarded without
having been used are also selected at random from the hopper.  When
the hopper is empty, the next group of words read from the file are
placed into the hopper.  Once all of the words in the original file
have been processed, the hopper is filled with words from the start
of the original file again.  Duplicates are discarded each time the
hopper is filled, but a password assigned in 1 filling of the hopper
might have appeared in a previous filling of the hopper.
.skip.test page 10
The RSMPSW program asks the following questions.
.skip.test page 8.nofill
FILE CONTAINING LIST OF STUDENT NAMES?
FILE CONTAINING LIST OF PASSWORDS?
OUTPUT FILE FOR PASSWORD CHECKER?
OUTPUT FILE FOR WORD PROCESSOR?
.fill.skip
These questions merely establish the names of the various files.  On
the DECsystem10 and DECsystem20 computers, these file names must consist
of 1 to 6 letters or digits, a period which must be typed, and an
optional 1 to 3 letters or digits.
.skip.test page 5
KERNEL FOR RANDOM NUMBERS?
.skip
Either zero or a positive integer should be typed in response to this
question.  The number is used to select the sequence of numbers which
are returned by the random number generator.
.skip.test page 5
DISCARD HOW MANY INITIAL PASSWORDS?
.skip
Discarding the initial passwords is really useful only if a single
large file containing many possible passwords is being used repeatedly.
The number typed here would then be the number of passwords processed
the last time that passwords were selected from the file.  If a
different file is being used, or if a different sampling interval
selected by the next question is being used, or if the file was scanned
more than once the last time, then 0 should be typed here.
.skip.test page 5
ON AVERAGE, USE 1 PASSWORD OUT OF HOW MANY?
.skip
If the same large file containing many possible passwords is being
used repeatedly, and if the contents of this file might be known by
the students, then a portion of the possible passwords can be rejected
to make guessing the passwords based upon the known contents of the
original file more difficult.  If either 0 or 1 is typed here, then
all of the passwords in the file will be used until enough have been
obtained.  If a number greater than 1 is typed here, then this is the
number of possible passwords which are discarded each time 1 is used.
If 10 is typed here, then only 1 out of 10 possible passwords is used.
.skip.test page 6
NUMBER TO ASSIGN TO FIRST STUDENT?
.break
INCREMENT EACH STUDENT NUMBER HOW MUCH?
.skip
The answers to these questions are used to obtain the numbers which
are assigned to the students.  If the initial number is 10 and the
increment is 5, then the students would be assigned the numbers 10,
15, 20, 25, etc.

.left margin 1.list.le
Build the account in which the resumes will be stored.  This account
should have the following characteristics:
.list.display element'',LU,'.'.le
Disk storage allocation of about 2 pages per student.  Most resumes
require just 1 page, but some require 2, and there has to be room for
a modest set of deleted former versions which have not yet been
expunged.  There should also be enough disk allocation for a duplicate
set of resumes for any class.  This is necessary since the RSMADM
program produces a new copy of each resume each time that the resume
changes state.
.le
Default file protection of 776400.  This prevents other accounts from
using the directory commands to find out what files are in the account.
The files can be overwritten by new versions.

Directory protection of 774400.  This allows accounts in the proper
user group to write new files into the resume storage account.

Directory group the same as the user group of the accounts which will
run the RESUME program.  If this cannot be done, then make sure that
the right 2 digits of the various protection codes are all the same
as the middle 2 digits instead of 00.

The resume storage account must contain several files which are to
be read from the students' accounts, but which should not be able to
be rewritten from these accounts.  These files should have 775200
protection.

Insert the name of the account where the resumes will be stored into
the DATA statement which defines the NUMDIR character string in the
BLOCK DATA routine.  This character string must contain exactly 40
characters.  Fill out the right end of the string beyond the end of
the name with spaces.  Do not include the less than and greater than
signs in the name.
.le
If the resume storage account already exists, delete any resumes in
it from the previous graduating class.
.le
Validate an account or accounts to act as the various classes of
administrator by inserting their account names into the RESUME.WHO
file.  Instructions for validating these accounts are given elsewhere
in this manual.
.le
If this is the first year that these particular students have run the
RESUME program, validate their accounts by inserting a line describing
their accounts into the RESUME.WHO file.
.le
If the students are all to use a single account to run the RESUME
program, set up this account.  It should be in the same user group
as the directory group of the resume storage account.  Insert this
account name into the RESUME.WHO file and indicate that the students
must use passwords to run the RESUME program.
.le
If the passwords are to be assigned to the students, rather than
selected by the students, then construct a file named PASWRD.XXX, where
XXX is the class number, in the resume storage account.  This should
have 775200 protection.  This file can be constructed using the RSMPSW
program, or by hand using a text editor.  The contents of this file
and the use of the RSMPSW program are described elsewhere in this
manual.
.le
If resumes from the previous year are to be used again, but words which
were entirely capitalized are to have the second and following letters
converted to lower case, then construct a file named RESUME.WRD
containing any words which are to be left entirely in upper case.  The
contents of the RESUME.WRD file are described elsewhere in this manual.
Then run the RSMMIX program to perform the conversion on all words
except those listed in the RESUME.WRD file.
.le
If the resumes from the previous year are to be used again, change
the validation of the student accounts in the RESUME.WHO file to
indicate whether the final output is to be typed or typeset.
.le
If this is the first year that the students in this class have used
the RESUME program, construct a file named SCHOOL.XXX, where XXX is
the class number, which describes the degree program in which the
students are enrolled.  The first line should contain only the EDUCATION
section name.  The next lines should define the contents of the start
of the EDUCATION section.  An asterisk should appear at the start of
each line which is also to start a new line in the finished resume.
If the second line starts with an asterisk, then it will appear 1 line
below the section name in the resume.  If it does not start with an
asterisk, then it will appear on the same line but to the right of
the section name.  Use circumflexes in front of each word of the school
name to indicate that these words are to be darkened.  The final line
should contain only an equal sign.
.skip.test page 3
The SCHOOL.XXX file should define no more lines than will require 7
lines to be displayed on the terminal, allowing 80 characters per line
and the use of an extra line below underlined or darkened letters.
A _.PAGE POSITION +9 command in the rough form of the help messages
for the RESUME program adjusts the count of the lines displayed on
the screen to allow room for the insertion of the description of the
degree program in which the students are currently enrolled and room
for blank lines before and after this description.  If more lines would
be required, then the _.PAGE POSITION command will have to be changed
correspondingly where these lines are displayed, and the rough form
of the help messages will have to be reprocessed by the FORMAT program
to produce new FORTRAN source code.
.skip.test page 8
A typical SCHOOL.XXX file is shown below.

.skip.fill.test page 3
The asterisk at the start of the line containing the school name forces
the school name to appear on the line below the name of the section.
If this asterisk is removed, then the name of the school would appear
on the same line as, and to the right of, the word EDUCATION.
.le
If the printing service is to have its own account, build it with the
same default file protection code and the same directory protection
code as were used for the resume storage account.  Insert the name
of this account into the definition of the NUMYPS character string
in the BLOCK DATA routine.  If this account already exists, clean out
any old resumes left over from the previous year.
.le
Replace the account named in the RESUME.CTL file by the current name
of the resume storage account.  Either in the resume storage account,
or preferably from an account higher in the directory tree, submit
the RESUME.CTL to run a batch job.  This expunges the resume storage
account, writes a new version of the directory file RESUME.DIR into
the resume storage account, and resubmits itself to run again later.
The time until the next run of the batch job must be short enough that
the resume storage account will not run out of disk space until then.
A half hour interval is suggested.
.le
Compile, load and save the RESUME program, the RSMADM administrative
program, the RSMSRT name sorting program, and the RSMMIX case conversion
program.  Rename or copy the resulting _.EXE files into the system
storage account.  If the resume storage account and the printing service
account are unchanged, then the versions of these files from the
previous year can still be used.
.le
If the students will be sharing a single account, then some students
will probably type the login password when the RESUME program itself
asks for a password.  To protect against this, log into the shared
account, use the RESUME program to construct a dummy resume which can
be accessed using the login password, and then use the RSMADM program
to block further access to this resume.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE RSMADM PROGRAM
.CENTER
------------ --- ----- --- ------ -------
.skip
The RSMADM program is used by the administrator to list the authors
and the states of the resumes, to change the states of the resumes,
to proof the resumes, to rename the resumes, to copy the resumes into
the printing service account, and to block the resumes from further
use.  The program asks for the administrator to identify the function
which is to be performed, then asks for the administrator to specify
the criteria by which the resumes are to be selected.  The resumes
can be selected individually by class and by password or account number,
or else a group of resumes can be selected by some combination of class,
date of last modification and state.  A group of resumes can either
be selected in the order in which they appear in the directory of the
resume storage account, or can be selected in predetermined order based
upon an alphabetic sort of the students' names.
.skip 2.test page 15
Specifying the Function to be Performed
.left margin 5
.skip.test page 3
The program first asks the following question to determine what function
is to be performed.
.skip.left margin 5.test page 10.nofill
Specify 1 number to select among following functions
1=List student names, status and numbers in output file
2=Unsubmit

WHICH FUNCTION?
.fill
.left margin 5
.skip
The functions which are selected by the numbers are described below.
The program can only perform one of these functions each time it is
run.  The program will have to be run again if a second function is
to be performed.
.SKIP.left margin 10
.indent -3.test page 3

.skip.indent -3.test page 3
3##Submit the resume.  The resume can originally be in any state.  The
resulting resume will be in the SUBMITTED state even if it was in a
later state such as EDITED or TRANSMITTED.
.skip.indent -3.test page 3
4##Proof the resume.  The program will ask for the administrator to
specify the type of proofs which are desired.
.skip.indent -3.test page 3
5##Transmit the resume.  Later, when the resume is about to be
transmitted, the program will ask for the administrator to select a
number by which the typesetter can refer to the resume.  The transmitted
file will have this number as its name, nothing more.  Neither _.DOC
nor _.LST nor anything else will appear to the right of the number
used as the file name.  If the administrator assigns the number 12
to the resume, then the name of the transmitted file will be just 12.
This number does not correspond to and has no correlation with the
6 digit number by which the administrator identifies which resume is
to be transmitted.
.skip.indent -3.test page 3
6##Proof and unsubmit the resume.  This combines the proofing and
unsubmitting functions in a single function.  After the resume book
has been completed, some students want to customize their resumes for
particular companies.  If the resume collection was typeset, then the
RESUME.WHO file will also have to be changed to allow typed resumes.
The students can submit their resumes to indicate that they want the
administrator to produce new copies of their resumes typed on the letter
quality typewriter.  After the new copies have been typed, this function
unsubmits the resumes so that they can be modified further.  If the
RSMADM program is run from an account which is validated for use by
the word processing office, rather than by the administrator, then
this function is selected automatically.
.skip.indent -3.test page 3
7##Change the 6 digit number or password which can be used to access
the resume or change the class number associated with the resume.  This
copies the file giving the copy a new name.  The administrator will
be asked which type of naming scheme is to be used for the new file.
The names will depend upon whether the students run from their own
accounts without passwords, or use passwords assigned by the
administrator, or select their own passwords.  The administrator will
be asked to specify the new password and/or the new number, whichever
is appropriate, for each resume which is renamed.  The resume will
be copied into a new file with the number as its name or with a number
based upon the password as its name.  The old file is also rewritten
and is marked internally as being replaced.  The existence of the old
file will be ignored if the RESUME program is used to access it again.
.skip.indent -3.test page 3
8##Block the resume from further use.  The student will be told to
contact the administrator if the student attempts to access this resume
from an individual account or using an assigned password.  If the
student is selecting a password, then the RESUME program will tell
the student to select a different password.  A blocked resume might
be used to prevent any student from selecting the login password as
the password used within the RESUME program to select an individual
resume.
.left margin 5.skip.test page 3
If either function 4 or 6 which produce proofs of the resumes is chosen,
then the administrator will be asked the following question to determine
the format of the resumes.
.left margin 5
.skip.test page 6
CONTINUOUS, PAGED OR TYPESET FORMAT?
.skip
The answer to this question selects the overall format of the resumes
which are generated.  The administrator must select 1 of the following
formats.
.left margin 10
.skip.test page 3.indent -5
CONTINUOUS##If the final copies of the resumes will be included in
the typed resume book.  The resume for each student will be typed on
a separate page.  No page breaks will be inserted into resumes which
are longer than 60 lines and the letter quality typewriter will not
enforce 60 lines per page.  This usually allows resumes which have
increased in length slightly due to editing by the administrator to
still fit onto a single sheet of paper.
.skip.test page 3.indent -5
PAGED##For resumes which have been individually requested by the
students after the resume book has been finished.  The pages will be

If either function 4 or 6 is chosen, then the administrator will also
be asked the following question to determine the type of output device
which will be used to type or print the proofs of the resumes.
.skip.test page 3
TYPE OF BOLDING (NONE, PRINTER, TYPEWRITER)?
.skip
Bold or darkened lettering must be indicated quite differently on the
fast printer than on the letter quality typewriter.  On the fast
printer, it is sufficient to merely print the line containing the
characters to be darkened several times.  The fast printer is imprecise
enough that the several strikes of the letter blur sufficiently to
give dark letters.  The letter quality typewriter, however, types each
strike exactly over the other so that, except for filling in any gaps
in the strokes that form the letters, the second and subsequent strikes
do not make the letters visually darker.  Therefore, for the letter
quality typewriter, a second strike is made exactly over the first
strike, then the third strike is offset by 1/120th inch.  The various
types of boldfacing which are available are selected by the following
responses.
.left margin 10

.skip.test page 3.fill.left margin 5
The names of the files in which the resumes are stored are constructed
from the class number and a number which identifies the account from
which the resume was entered or which is based upon a password chosen
by the student or which is assigned along with a password to the
student.  Function 7 could be chosen to change either or both of these
numbers.  The program will report if some other resume has already
been created which corresponds to the new numbers.  The administrator
must type 1 of the following numbers in response to this question to
select the type of account which will be used in the future to access
the resumes.
.skip.test page 3.left margin 10
.indent -3
1##If the students in the new class use their own accounts.  It will
be necessary for the administrator to add lines specifying the new
classes which are to be associated with these accounts to the RESUME.WHO
file.  These lines must appear before the lines which specify the
default class for the group of accounts containing these particular
accounts.  The program will ask for the new class number and student
number for each resume.  If a file already exits for this class number
and student number, then the administrator will be asked to specify
a different student number.
.skip.test page 3.indent -3
2##If the students in the new class use passwords which are assigned
to them by the administrator.  The program will ask for the new class
number, new student number and new password which are to be associated

student number, then the administrator will be asked to specify a
different student number.
.skip.test page 3.indent -3
3##If the students in the new class use passwords which they themselves
select.  The program will ask for the new class number and password
for each resume.  If a file already exists for this class number and
the 6 digit number which the program calculates from the password,
then the administrator will be asked to specify a different password.

This password can either have been chosen by the student or have been
assigned by the administrator.  Regardless of who chose the password,
if the other students in the new class have also been assigned
passwords, then the administrator will be asked to specify a number
to be used with the password.  If the students are running the RESUME
program from their own individual accounts, then the administrator
must identify the programmer number of each of these accounts.  This
question is not asked if the students are allowed to choose their own
passwords.

PRODUCTION OF THE RESUME BOOK
.center
---------- -- --- ------ ----
.skip.test page 3
The various procedures which must be performed to produce the typed
resume book are described below.  Where references are made to the
staff of the publications office, these are the people who will be
editing the the resumes, both for style and correctness.  The resume
book is produced for the placement office.  The placement office has
the ultimate say as to which resumes are included in the book.
.skip.test page 3
The list given here should be used only as a general guide.  The actual
sequence of events will depend greatly on human factors:  for example,
upon whether some students request that exceptions be made for them
after the deadlines; upon whether the placement office asks that the
list of students be modified; and upon how many times the resumes have
to be proofed, edited and transmitted.  It is essential that the
administrator understand why the various operations are performed so
that exceptions can be handled easily.
.left margin 1.list
.le
After the deadline for the submission of all resumes has passed, check
the terminal room to see if any students are still putting in their
resumes.  If so, urge them to finish.
.le
Issue the monitor command SYSTAT ALL which will list all users currently
on the system.  Check the type-out to insure that no student is still
running the RESUME program.
.le
In the RESUME.WHO file in the file storage account, change the second
number on each line which validates the students just completing their
resumes to the value -1.  This prevents them from running the program
again, but gives them the messages in the MESAGE.XXX file, where XXX
is the class number with leading zeros, before kicking them off.  This
prevents the students from getting paper copies of their submitted
resumes while the resumes are being edited by the publications office
staff.
.le
Change the message in the MESAGE.XXX file to tell the students in the
class that the program is closed to them.  They will see this message
if they try to run the RESUME program and will then be kicked out of
the program.
.le
Make a copy of all of the resume files for the current class in another
account just in case you goof up somewhere.
.le
Run the RSMADM program and ask for a list of all of the students in
the current class.  When the program asks for the earliest modification
date which is to be accepted, give a date just a little before the
start of the period when the students could run the RESUME program
this time.  This will reject any resumes from students who were in
the class the previous year but who have since dropped out.  The list
of students will be written to a file name RESUME.LST.
.le
If some students have worked on their resumes, but have not submitted
them, then some of these may still have to be included in the resume
collection.  The question of what to do with unsubmitted resumes is
complicated when the students select their own passwords.  Some of
the students will compose several resumes and then only submit one.
Other students will practice using the program, then enter their real
resumes with different passwords rather than just cancelling the
practice resumes.  Some will just have forgotten to submit their
resumes.
.skip.test page 3
The RSMADM program will have to be used to produce proofs of the
unsubmitted resumes.  Some of these resumes can obviously be discarded.
For example, any resume which does not start with a student's name
can be discarded.  An unsubmitted resume which starts with the name
of a student who also submitted another resume can also be discarded.
The resumes should be discarded by using the RSMADM program to transfer
them into a class number reserved for junk.  The students responsible
for the rest of the unsubmitted resumes should be contacted to determine
whether they just forgot to submit their resumes.  If some of these
resumes are to be included in the resume collection, then the RSMADM
program should be used to submit these resumes.  Alternatively, the
RESUME program can be opened up again for awhile and the students can
be asked to finish their resumes and submit them.
.skip.test page 3
Finally, when all questions concerning the unsubmitted resumes have
been resolved, run the RSMADM program again to produce a fresh list
of the students.
.le
Run the RSMSRT program to sort the student names in the RESUME.LST
file which was produced by the RSMADM program.  The RSMSRT program
will write a file named RESUME.SRT which will list the students sorted
by last name.  The program is able to recognize most suffixes of the
names, such as II or Jr., but if an unusual suffix is used, this could
be treated as a last name causing the student to be out of alphabetical
order.  The RSMSRT program has its array space dimensioned for 400
students.  The appearance of 400 in the DIMENSION and DATA statements
will have to be increased if there are more than 400 students who must
be included in alphabetical order in a single resume collection.  Type
at least 3 copies of the RESUME.SRT file.
.le
Run the RSMADM program to produce proofs of the resumes for all of
the students in the class.  When the program asks whether the resumes
are to be processed in a preselected order, respond "YES" so that these
can be processed in the order in which these were sorted by the RSMSRT
program.  The CONTINUOUS format should be selected with bolding for
the TYPEWRITER.
.skip.test page 3
Follow the directions given later in this manual for typing these
resumes on the letter quality typewriter.  Photocopy the resulting
resumes and give the photocopy of the resumes and 1 copy of the printout
of the RESUME.SRT file to the placement office staff so that they can
verify that the list is correct.  Give the originals of the resumes
and 2 copies of the printout of the RESUME.SRT file to the publications
office staff who will be editing the resumes.
.le
Modify the RESUME.WHO file, if necessary, so that the account used
by the publications office is listed as an administrator for the current
class.  If they will only be doing editing but will not be using the
RSMADM program themselves, then do not give them full administrator
privileges.
.le
If some students come in and say that they forgot to enter their
resumes, some provision will have to be made to insure that they can
enter their resumes.  If the administrator is not concerned that other
students who did not submit their resumes might use the opportunity
of the RESUME program being opened to enter their own resumes, then
all that is necessary is to change the entry for the class in the
RESUME.WHO file so that the class can run the RESUME program again.
In a class of about 150 persons, usually at least 1 will have forgotten
to enter a resume during the official period but will then become very
concerned afterwards.
.skip.test page 3
About 5 to 10 people in a class of 150 will discover errors in their
resumes after the deadline has passed.  Unless the resumes require
a lot of modification, it is usually easiest to have the administrator
make these changes for the students.  If the changes have to be made
by the students, then the administrator will have to run the RSMADM
program to unsubmit the resumes which are to be changed.
.skip.test page 3
The following instructions suggest how to open the RESUME program to
particular students but keep it closed to other students who did not
submit their resumes.
.skip.test page 3
If the students are using their own individual accounts, then all that
is necessary is to add lines opening their accounts to the RESUME.WHO
file.  These lines would have to appear before the lines which specify
the group of accounts used by the students since by now the group of
accounts is closed to the RESUME program.
.skip.test page 3
If the students have been running from a single account and were using
passwords which were assigned to them, then it will be necessary to
move or copy the lines which define the passwords for the students
who are still allowed to run the program to the start of the PASWRD.XXX
file, where XXX stands for the class number, and to insert a line
containing only an equal sign between these lines and the lines which
specify the passwords which are not active.  The rest of the lines,
and in particular the line containing just an equal sign at the end
of the file, should be retained so that the entire list of students
can be allowed access later merely by removing the line containing
the equal sign which was inserted into the middle of the file.  The
line which specifies the shared account in the RESUME.WHO file will
also have to be changed to allow use of the RESUME program again.
.skip.test page 3
If the students have been running from a single account and have been
selecting their own passwords, then it will be necessary to change
the entry in the RESUME.WHO file so that the students use assigned
passwords instead.  Also, this line will have to be changed to allow
use of the RESUME program.  A PASWRD.XXX file will have to be created
which contains the passwords which the students selected.  The numbers
which appear to the left of the passwords in this file must be the
6 digit numbers to which the RESUME program converts the passwords.
A listing of either the RESUME.LST or RESUME.SRT file can be consulted
to obtain these numbers.  Alternatively, either the RESUME program
or the RSMADM program can be run by the administrator to obtain these
numbers.  The students will have to be told the values of the 6 digit
numbers.  The students who will be starting or changing their resumes
after the deadline will have to use both the numbers and the passwords
to run the RESUME program.  It is not necessary that the administrator
change the files which contain the resumes in any way.  Although both
the number and the password appear in each resume file, it makes no
difference to the programs whether an assigned number is selected at
random by the administrator or is the same as the value which the
program would produce when it constructs a number based upon the
password.  Later, to open the RESUME program to all of the students
after the resume book has been completed, it will only be necessary
to change the single line entry in the RESUME.WHO file to allow student
selected passwords again and to delete the PASWRD.XXX file.
.LE
If the placement office decides that some of the students who have
entered their resumes are not entitled to have their resumes in the
resume book, then the RSMADM program will have to be run for these
students to move their resumes to some other class or to a class
reserved for junk resumes.  It is suggested that the class numbers
should be based upon the right 2 digits of the expected year of
graduation for the class and that the hundreds digit indicate the type
of account being used.
.skip.test page 3
For example, the following class numbers might be chosen for the class
of '85.
.skip.test page 3.left margin +5.i-3
85#if the student is running from the shared account.
.skip.test page 3.i-4
185#if the student is running from an individual account.  This account
is a member of a group of similar individual accounts used by the
members of this class.
.left margin -5
.skip.test page 3
Students who were using their own accounts for the original class will
continue to use their own accounts for the new class.  Students who
were using a shared account for the original class will have to use
the different shared account which is being used for the new class.
.skip.test page 3
In most cases if the students chose their own passwords to run the
RESUME program, then their original passwords can continue to be used
for the new class.  If a password already being used by someone else
in the new class matches their old password, then the RSMADM program
will block the transfer and will require that the administrator select
another password.  The RESUME.WHO file does not have to be changed,
but the students will have to be told how to gain access to the shared
account being used for the new class and will have to be told the new
passwords if these had to be changed.
.skip.test page 3
If numbers and passwords were assigned to the students, then the lines
defining the passwords must be moved from the PASWRD.XXX file for the
old class to that of the new class.  Since the number portion of each
combination of number and password assigned by the administrator must
be unique within the class, it is likely that the administrator will
have to pick a new number but the password can be left unchanged even
if it duplicates a password already in use in the new class.  The
RESUME.WHO file does not have to be changed, but the students will
have to be told how to gain access to the shared account being used
for the new class and will have to be told what the new numbers are.
.skip.test page 3
If the student has been using an individual account, then a line must
be inserted into the RESUME.WHO file defining the new association of
the account with the class number.  This line must be inserted before
the line which defines the class for students using similar accounts.
The student will not see any change.

When the list of students who will be included in the resume collection
has finally settled down, run the RSMADM program to list the resumes
again, and then run the RSMSRT program to sort the list.  Type the
RESUME.SRT file and give copies to the placement office staff and to
the publications office staff.
.le
Whenever some students have been added to the list, or some of the
resumes have been edited, run the RSMADM program again to produce proofs
of their resumes.  The resumes for added students can be produced by
selecting resumes in the SUBMITTED state, and those which have been
edited can be produced by selecting the EDITED state.  Both of these
states can be selected for in a single run of the RSMADM program.  Type
the resumes on the letter quality typewriter as before, and give the
resulting resumes to the publications office staff.
.le
When all of the resumes have been checked and verified, a final typed
copy of all of the resumes may have to be prepared to be used as the
master copy for production of the resume book.  Alternatively, if the
final copies of each resume which have been checked by the publications
office staff have not been marked and are still clean, then that set
might be used as the master.
.le
Finally, after the master copy of the resume book has been prepared,
use the RSMADM program to unsubmit the resumes so that the students
can modify the resumes and type them on the letter quality typewriter.
Change the third number on each of the lines in the RESUME.WHO file
which validate the accounts which can be used by the class from 1 which
allowed them just a single page resume to a value of 4 to allow them

The following is a complete list of the steps necessary for typing
the resumes on the letter quality typewriter attached to the Yale
DECsystem20 computer once the RSMADM program has written the resumes
into the RESUME.PRF file.  This procedure will differ elsewhere.  The
HC (HardCopy) program which is used in this procedure reads a file
and types it onto the controlling terminal.  The HC program is used
because it causes escape characters (the alt-mode) and control
characters to be transmitted unchanged to the terminal.  This is
necessary for the proper positioning of the multiple strikes used for
darkening the student names, section names, school names and company
names in the resumes.  The HC program is not distributed with the
student resume system.

back 1/4th inch to the right.  Load the 8 1/2 x 11 bond 25% cotton
paper into the sprocket drive mechanism.  This paper has very tiny
perforations so that it looks like ordinary typing paper when the edges
are torn off.

Press the FF switch located above the keyboard.  Use the knobs at the
ends of the platen to line up the perforations between the next two

.center
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPED AND TYPESET RESUME BOOKS
.center
----------- ------- ----- --- ------- ------ -----
.skip
The RESUME program can prepare the resumes either to be typed on a
letter quality typewriter or to be typeset.  Typed resumes are assumed
to have pages which are 87 characters wide and to be typed with a pitch
of 12 characters per inch.  Extra characters are inserted into the
file to cause overstriking to be misaligned slightly in order to darken
selected words.  The characters which are inserted are specific for
the Diablo 1600 series and Xerox 1700 series of terminals and will
probably have to be changed for use on other types of letter quality
typewriters.  The program can also produce darkened characters on a
fast printer.  The imprecision inherent in such fast printers misaligns
the characters enough that darkened words can be obtained merely by
overprinting the words several times.
.skip.test page 3
The technique used for darkening characters on the Diablo terminal
is to shift the typing slightly before overprinting the characters.
The entire line is first typed normally.  Then a carriage return is
issued without a line feed and the portion of the line which is to
be darkened is overprinted.  This insures that a complete strike of
each letter has been obtained, but does not produce much darker
characters since the 2 strikes are precisely aligned.  After another
carriage return, special characters are sent to the terminal to cause
it to make all characters be 1/120 inch wide, a space is sent to the
terminal which will move the printhead 1/120 inch, and then more special
characters are sent to the terminal to set the character width back
to 1/12 inch.  Finally the characters to be darkened are typed a last
time but now they will be shifted 1/120 inch to the right.
.skip.test page 3
When the resumes are to be typeset rather than typed, the RESUME program
calculates the width of each word based upon the character widths in
a particular type font.  The proofs which the students can print on
the fast printer will have a very ragged right edge because the number
of characters in each line is calculated to match the typeset resumes.
After the resumes have been completed, the RSMADM program copies the
resumes into an account used by the printing service.  In the resumes
copied into the printing service account, the words in adjacent lines
which are not prevented from being wrapped around are combined into
single lines which can become very long.  Initial spaces are removed
and multiple spaces are compressed to single spaces.  The rules between
sections are indicated by the capitalized word RULE.  Other than this,
the resumes copied into the printing service account are pretty much
what the students saw.  No typesetting commands are inserted.  It is
the responsibility of the printing service to copy the files onto their

commands.

The character widths currently defined in the BLOCK DATA routine are
for the Univers font.  These widths were obtained by measuring each
character in the typeset resumes from a previous year.  The allowed
maximum length of a line was adjusted until the correct number of words
in a line was obtained in most cases.  A new set of character widths
would have to be determined in order to use any other font.
.skip.test page 3
The proofreading copies of the resumes which are to be typeset are
printed on a fast hardcopy terminal.  Since both the maximum number
of characters on a line and the maximum number of lines on a page are
greater than would be acceptable for normally proportioned pages, the
hardcopy terminal should be capable of producing reduced size letters.
Alternatively, larger sheets of paper could be used.  The hardcopy
terminal which is used for production of the proofreading copies of
the resumes is a DECWRITER LA120.  Narrow 8.5 inch wide paper should
be put into the DECWRITER terminal.  The DECWRITER should be set to
give 16 characters per inch, 8 lines per inch, and 88 lines per page.
The left margin should be about 1.5 inches to the right of the left
edge of the paper after the perforations are removed.  To change these
settings, hold down the SETUP key and press the H (for horizontal)
key until the 12 appears, then the V (for vertical) key until the 8
appears, and then the F (for form length) key until the 88 appears.
Still holding down the SETUP key, press the space bar until the number
15 appears showing that the printhead is in column 15, then press the
numeric key in the upper row which has MARGIN LEFT written above it.
If the left margin were to be set before setting the pitch (characters
per inch), then the margin setting would be lost.  Release the SETUP
key and adjust the paper position until there is a 1.5 inch left margin
and about a 0.5 inch top margin.  Finally use the HC program to type
the file.  If a TYPE command is used instead to type the file, then
the monitor command must be issued which allows long lines.  On the
DECsystem20, the command shown below would be issued to allow long
lines to be typed on the terminal.

The RESUME.SRT file is used by the RSMADM program both to determine
the order in which the resumes are processed, and to determine the
numbers which will be used as the names of the files which are
transmitted to the printing service.  The RSMSRT program should not
be run after the publications office has started to use these numbers
to identify the resumes.  If resumes are added to or removed from the
collection but the original numbering must be maintained, then the
text editor should be used to modify the RESUME.SRT file rather than
running the RSMSRT program again.  Care must be taken when editing
the RESUME.SRT file to insure that the numbers are placed into the
proper columns in the added lines and that no duplicates appear in
the numbers at the left end of the lines.  Care should also be taken
that no non-numeric characters are placed into the columns which contain
numbers.  The non-numeric stuff on the lines is not used by the RSMADM
program and need not be duplicated on the added lines although it is
a good idea to insert the student's name where this appears in the
original lines.
.skip.test page 3
The first time that the RSMADM program is used to copy resumes to the
printing service account, the question about whether the resumes are
to be processed in a preselected order should be answered "YES".  This
sends the resumes in the alphabetical order of the students' names
and gives them names which are based upon the numbers appearing at
the start of the lines in the RESUME.SRT file.
.skip.test page 3
If all of the edited resumes must be transmitted again, then these
can also be transmitted in preselected order.  The RSMADM program will
use the numbers which appear at the left ends of the lines in the
RESUME.SRT file as the names of the files which are copied into the
printing service account.  If the resumes which are to be transmitted
again are selected individually, or are selected as a group but not
in the preselected order, then the program will ask for the
administrator to specify the numbers to be used as the names of the
transmitted files.  The administrator will have to consult a copy of
the RESUME.SRT file to determine these numbers.

CONVERSION FROM FIRST YEAR RESUME FORMAT TO SECOND YEAR

.skip
The final version of the resume book for the first year class is typed
on a Diablo terminal.  The second year resumes are typeset at the
printing service.  The resumes which the students entered during their
first year form the starting point for the second year collection.
Since typed and typeset resumes have different line widths and different
line spacings, the RESUME program must know upon which device the
resumes will be produced.  This is specified by the third number on
the line in the RESUME.WHO file which validates the accounts from which
the RESUME program will be run.  Before the students start to modify
their resumes for the second year collection, the third number on the
line or lines which validate their accounts should be changed from
the value 1 or greater which specified the maximum number of pages
of typed output to the value 0 which specifies typeset output.
.skip.test page 3
If the students are running the RESUME program from their own accounts,
but these accounts have changed, then the RSMADM program will have
to be used to rename the files containing the resumes.  The RSMADM
program will also have to be run to unsubmit any submitted resumes
in the new second year class.  Resumes for the previous graduating
class should be deleted.
.skip.test page 3
For the first year collection, the students are instructed to use only
capital letters for their own names and for the names of the sections
of the resumes and for the names of organizations.  An exception was
made for last names which have prefixes such as du or La or Mc, in
which the use of lower case letters in the conventional locations in
the prefix was recommended.  For the second year collection, the
students are instead asked to capitalize only the first letters of
the words in most names.  The students could be instructed to make
these case conversions themselves, but the administrator should use
the RSMMIX program to perform these conversions in all of the resumes
for the entire class.
.skip.test page 3
The RSMMIX program converts the second and subsequent letters in
sequences formed entirely of capital letters to lower case.  The program
does not change any letters which are already in lower case.  In a
name such as McDONALD, in which there is an embedded lower case letter
c, both the capital letter at the start of the name and the capital
letter after the lower case letter are left capitalized.  All of the
files which are read and written by the RSMMIX program are in the resume
storage account.  The account from which the RSMMIX program is run
must be able to both read and write into the resume storage account,
and must be validated for all administrative functions by the RESUME.WHO
file.  The RSMMIX program can process the resumes for up to 10 class
numbers each time that it is run.  The RSMMIX program asks the
administrator to specify which classes are to be processed, then
processes the files which are specified for these classes in the
RESUME.DIR directory file.
.skip.test page 3
A file named RESUME.WRD which specifies the words which are to be left
capitalized by the RSMMIX program is also read from the resume storage
account.  The RESUME.WRD file is not required.  Each line in this file
should contain a single word which is to be left capitalized when the
resumes are processed.  The appearance of this word in the RESUME.WRD
file must itself be capitalized.  If a word which is entirely
capitalized in the resumes is to be converted entirely to lower case,
as for example if the words AND and OR appear in company or school
names which were originally entirely capitalized, then the capitalized
version of each word should be followed on the same line by 1 or more
spaces and then by the desired lower case form of the word.  The 2
appearance of the word on the line must each contain the same number
of letters.  The RSMMIX program cannot be used to change to or from
the abbreviations of words.  There can be at most 1000 reserved words
containing a total of 5000 letters.

CALCULATION OF FILE NAMES BASED ON PASSWORDS
.center
----------- -- ---- ----- ----- -- ---------
.skip
The names of the files in which the resumes are stored are constructed
from the class number and from a number which uniquely identifies a
particular student in that class.  If the students are running the
RESUME program from their own individual accounts, then the numbers
by which the computer system identifies their accounts from all others
are used as the student numbers.  If the students are each assigned
a number and a password by the administrator, then these numbers are
used in the construction of the file names and it is the responsibility
of the administrator to make sure that these numbers are unique among
all of the students in the class.
.skip.test page 3
If the students select their own passwords, then the program calculates
a number based upon the password, and the program verifies that this
number is not being used for any other resume in the same class.  The
alphabetic letters A through Z and the digits 0 through 9 are allowed
in the passwords.  The password can consist of up to 20 of these
characters counting each separation between words as 1 character.  The
program converts this password into a 6 digit number.  The resulting
numbers are not unique since there are many more possible passwords
than resulting numbers.  For example, all of the numbers 0 through
1 less than 10 to the 20th power could be used as passwords, and then
there are all of the possible combinations of up to 20 alphabetic
letters and digits.
.skip.test page 3
If half a million students in the same class were to put in their
resumes using the program, there would be 1 chance in 2 that the next
student who had not run the program before would choose a password
which would be converted to a number which was the same as that
calculated from a password which was already in use.  To guard against
this student from gaining access to an existing resume, the password
selected by the student is stored in the same file as the resume.  The
program then checks the password stored in the selected file against
the password which the user has typed in, and if these do not match,
then the user is instructed to select another password.  Although both
the password as typed by the student and that stored in the file must
be divided into the same number of words, capitalization and the actual
number of spaces between the words are ignored.
.skip.test page 3
The method used to convert the password to a number treats the password
as a radix 37 number.  Each allowed character is assigned a value in
the range 0 through 36.  Moving from the right end of the password,
the value assigned to the first or rightmost character is multiplied
by 1, the second is multiplied by 1*37 (where * represents times or
multiplied by) and is added to the first, the third is multiplied by
1*37*37 or 1369 and is added to the sum of the first and the second,
and so on.  This is analogous to the way in which an ordinary decimal
number is evaluated, except that, in the ordinary case, the second
number is multiplied by 1*10 and the third by 1*10*10 and so on.  The
values which are assigned to the allowed characters are as follows:
.skip.test page 3.nofill
            0 = The separation between words
 1 through 26 = the alphabetic letters A through Z
27 through 36 = the digits 0 through 9
.skip.fill.test page 3
When the resulting number is 1000000 or greater, only the rightmost
6 decimal digits are retained.  Thus, the number corresponding to the
password S0QB, in which the second character is the digit zero, would
be calculated in the following manner:
.skip.nofill.test page 8
S has a value of 19
0 has a value of 27
Q has a value of 17
B has a value of  2
.skip
19*1*37*37*37 + 27*1*37*37 + 17*1*37 + 2*1
=    19*50653 +    27*1369 +   17*37 +   2
=      962407 +      36963 +     629 +   2
=     1000001
.skip.fill.test page 3
The resulting rightmost 6 digits have the value 1, which is identical
to the value calculated for a password consisting of the single letter
A.  The first 20 passwords for which the rightmost 6 digits of the
numbers calculated from them have the same value as that for a password
consisting of the single letter A are listed below.
.skip.nofill.test page 5

.skip.fill.test page
Since the space between words is represented by the absence of a
character, there are no passwords with rightmost spaces.  This is unlike
the evaluation of ordinary decimal numbers in which 1 is not equivalent
to 10 or to 100 since zero is itself a placeholder.  As one progresses
through all possible passwords, some of the corresponding values are
therefore skipped.  For example in the following table
.skip.test page 3.nofill
  99  = 1368    A 9  = 1405    A99  = 2737    B 9  = 2774
(A--) = 1369   (AA-) = 1406   (B--) = 2738   (BA-) = 2775
 A A  = 1370    AAA  = 1407    B A  = 2739    BAA  = 2776
.skip.fill.test page 3
the passwords shown in parentheses with minus signs where the word
separations would be necessary for the calculation of the indicated
values would have to have word separations beyond the rightmost words
and are impossible.  There are, of course, longer passwords which have
the rightmost 6 digits of their calculated values equivalent to the
values corresponding to these impossible cases so all values in the
range 0 through 999999 can actually be used for file names.
.skip.test page 3
The file name is constructed of the 6 digit number followed by a period
and then by the class number represented as a 3 digit number.  Both
numbers are right justified with zeros being filled in at the left.
The password B used by a member of the class of '83 would select a
file having 000002.083 as its name.

The students who use the RESUME program have no way of knowing the
language in which it is written.  All of the logic in the programs
in the student resume system is written in FORTRAN.  Together, the
programs contain 6000 FORTRAN statements.  Most of this code is
completely machine independent.  However, a few of the things which
the programs do must be performed differently on different computers.
In so far as possible, these machine dependent aspects of the programs
have been isolated into routines which perform no other functions.
.left margin 1.list
.le
The BLOCK DATA routine specifies the locations of the resume storage
account and the printing service account.  These are specified as octal
project and programmer numbers in the DECsystem10 version and as the
account names in characters strings in the DECsystem20 version.
.le
The BLOCK DATA routine specifies the sequence of characters which must
be sent to the Diablo terminal to move the printhead 1/120 inch to
the right in order to misalign overprinting to get darkened letters.
These characters are specified as several 36-bit values which can be
written into the output file using a multiple of an A1 format.  The
sequence of characters will have to be changed for other terminals.
The bit codes will have to be changed for other computers.  These
characters are used only in the RSMPRF routine which writes the
reformatted resumes into an output file.
.le
The BLOCK DATA routine specifies the relative widths of the characters
in a particular type font for typesetting.  This table will have to
be redefined if any other type font is used instead.  The table is
not used if the resumes are typed on a letter quality typewriter.
.le
The RSMHLP routine which issues the help messages has been built
assuming that the RESUME program will be run from video terminals which
can display 24 lines on the screen.  The _.PAGE LENGTH command in the
rough form of these messages specifies a value which is 2 lines less
than the maximum number of lines which can be shown on the screen,
so that there is room at the bottom for the "PRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE"
message.  The _.PAGE LENGTH command will have to be changed
correspondingly if the program is run from terminals which cannot show
a full 24 lines on the screen, and the FORMAT program will have to
be run again to produce a new version of the RSMHLP routine.  The RSMHLP
routine does not have to be rebuilt if the program is being run from
a hardcopy terminal instead.
.le
The GETLIN routine which reads in a line from the terminal discards
control characters on the DECsystem10 and DECsystem20 computers.  Any
character read by a multiple of an A1 format which has a value between
0 (integer zero, not '0') and '#' (the space character) is discarded.
The 2 statements which perform these tests will have to be removed
for use on any other computer.
.le
The OPEN statements in the RSMOPN routine and the CLOSE statements
in the RSMCLS routine will have to be changed for use on other
computers.  On the DECsystem10 and DECsystem20 computers, the RSMDIR
routine also opens, reads from and closes a file which contains a
directory of the account in which the resumes are stored.  Other than
this, all opening and closing of files is performed by the RSMOPN and
RSMCLS routines.
.le
A few simple assembly language routines are used to control the manner
in which the computer system manages the typing of characters onto
the terminal, to identify the account being used to run the program
and to exit gracefully without the usual time usage messages.  The
following is a complete list of these assembly language routines.
.skip.test page 3
TTYSET sets the characteristics of the controlling terminal.  The most
important of these is the turning off the pausing after a certain number
of lines have been displayed on the screen.  The RESUME program does
its own parcelling out of lines to the screen.
.skip.test page 3
JOBINF returns information about the account from which the program
is being run.  The information which is returned includes the name
of the account, the corresponding project number which on the
DECsystem20 always has the value 4, and the corresponding programmer
number.  The DECsystem10 version of this routine is called PPNU which
stands for Project Programmer NUmber.
.skip.test page 3
LEAVE exits from the program without the time statistics produced by
the FORTRAN STOP statement.
.le
The RSMWIP routine clears the screen of a video terminal by typing
a form feed.  This may have to be done differently on other computer
systems.
.le
The NEWDAT routine returns the current date as the numeric month, day
and year.  These are obtained by decoding a double precision word
containing the date in a form similar to '10-Oct-83'.  Since FORTRAN
has no standardized date routine, this also will have to be done
differently on other computer systems.
.le
The RSMCUL routine screens out characters which appear on an ASCII
keyboard but which do not appear on an 88 character Diablo printwheel.
The list of these characters will have to be changed if the program
is used with a different letter quality typewriter or if the program
is used on a computer in which FORTRAN does not allow all of these
characters to appear in DATA statements.
.le
The DAVERB routine which is used to identify words typed by the user
contains an array of the lower case alphabetic letters 'A' through
'Z' sorted in numerical order.  On the DECsystem10 and DECsystem20,
this order also happens to be the same as the alphabetic sort.  If
the numeric values of 'a' through 'z' sort in some other order, then
the array containing the lower case characters will have to be changed,
and the array containing the upper case characters will have to be
changed to remain parallel to the new ordering.
.le
The RSMSRT program sorts the student names assuming that the numerical
sort of the upper case letters 'A' through 'Z' is the same as the
alphabetic sort of these same characters.  The sorting procedure will
have to be changed if this is not the case.
.le
The RSMWHO routine calls the JOBINF routine to obtain the name of the
current account and the programmer number of this account.  The RSMWHO
routine then converts these into a form which can be used by the rest
of the program.  This conversion is machine dependent.
.le
The RSMDIR routine returns the student number and class number of the
next resume file in the resume storage account.  It does this by reading
a file produced by the DIRECTORY command.  This routine will have to
be changed for use on other computers.
.le
The DAHEFT, DAMISS and DAVERB routines are general routines which
interpret a line of text read from the terminal.  These routines all
treat a horizontal tabulation or tab character as equivalent to a space.
In order to identify the tab character, a variable named ITAB is defined
as the octal value "045004020100 in each of these routines.  This
definition will have to be changed on other computers, either to the
actual numeric value of 'tab' or 1Htab, or else to 'space' or 1Hspace,
where the words tab and space are meant to represent the nonprinting
characters tab and space respectively.
.list element
The RSMPSW program contains code for accepting file names from the
user, and OPEN and CLOSE statements.  This FORTRAN code is simple, but
will have to be changed for use on other computers.

The RSMPSW program contains a call to the SETRAN routine which
initializes the RAN random number function.  The corresponding routine

The student resume system was developed on a DECsystem20 computer.
The programs have been modified for the DECsystem10.  These computers
have basically the same hardware.  Only the operating systems are
different.  The main differences between the versions for the 2
computers result from the differences in the account structures.
.skip.test page 6
The following is a list of the differences between the DECsystem10
and the DECsystem20 versions.
.left margin +1.list
.le
In the BLOCK DATA routine in the DECsystem10 version, the account in
which files are stored and the account used by the printing service
are specified by project and programmer numbers.  Each of these accounts
is specified by an integer array dimensioned at 3.  The project number
is in the first location, the programmer number is in the second
location and a zero is in the third location.  In the DECsystem20
version, the locations of these accounts is specified by name in
character strings which are each dimensioned for 40 characters.
.le
In the RSMOPN routine in the DECsystem10 version, the OPEN statements
which open the files which are to be written into the storage account
and into the printing service account specify a protection code of
octal 100.  This allows subsequent versions of the same files to replace
the current versions.  In the DECsystem20 version, the default file
protection for the accounts into which the files are being written
can be set so as to allow overwriting by subsequent versions so it
is not necessary that the OPEN statements specify the protection codes.
.le
In the RSMDIR routine in the DECsystem10 version, it is assumed that
the file names in the file containing the directory of the storage
account each start in column 1 and that there is a tab character between
the 6 character name and the 3 character extension.  In the DECsystem20
version, the file names start in column 2 and a period appears between
the name and the extension.
.le
In the RSMWHO routine in the DECsystem10 version, the name of the
account is assumed to just be the octal project and programmer numbers
converted so that these can be written with a 40A1 format.  The unique
number which is returned for the account is actually the programmer
number so that the programmer can access the same resume from any
project for which the programmer has an account if passwords are not
being used to gain access to the RESUME program.  In the DECsystem20
version, the actual account names are used.  All accounts have the
same project number.  The programmer number is unique to the particular
account so only the account which was used when the resume was started
can modify it if passwords are not being used.
.le
In the assembly language routines in the DECsystem10 version, UUO's
are used.  The routine which sets terminal characteristics is just
a dummy entry point.  In the DECsystem20 version, JSYS's are used
instead of UUO's.  UUO's and JSYS's are the names given to the monitor
calls for the 2 operating systems.
.end list.left margin  0
.skip.test page 3
When setting up the accounts on the DECsystem10, the user file
directories or UFD's of the accounts into which files are to be written
from other accounts should be given protection codes of 777.  The
procedure for this would be to log into the accounts, and then to run
the PIP program to rename the UFD for each disk structure.  For example,
the following dialog could be used to change the protection of the
account on the DSKB_:  structure.
.skip.nofill.test page 3
R PIP
/R<777>=DSKB:[123,456].UFD
_^C
.SKIP.FILL.TEST PAGE 3
It must be noted that the UFD for a structure will disappear when the
job is logged off unless there is at least one file in the UFD on that
structure.  Therefore, a dummy file, perhaps named A_.  to force it
to be first in the sorted directory, should be created on each
structure.
.SKIP.FILL.TEST PAGE 3
The batch control file which is used on the DECsystem20 both expunges
the storage account and creates a file containing a list of the files
in this account.  The expunging is the most important part of this
process, since the students could be blocked from running the program
by old versions of the resumes if the disk quota were to be exceeded.
The directory file could be created using a command given manually.
Files are always expunged immediately on the DECsystem10, so the only
function which the batch control file would serve would be the making
of the directory.  A batch control file is not included for the
DECsystem10 version, so the administrator will have to create a
directory file before using the administrative programs to process
a collection of resumes.  The procedure here would be to log into the
file storage account and issue the command
.skip.nofill
DIRECT RESUME.DIR=*.*
.FILL
.skip.test page 3
The RSMCHK routine which determines whether the account being used
is allowed to run these programs is able to handle either the
DECsystem10 account numbers or the DECsystem20 account names.  The
contents of the entries in the RESUME.WHO file control which type of
account specification is matched.  If the file contains numbers enclosed
between square brackets, then the DECsystem10 account numbers are
matched.  If the file contains account names enclosed between less
than and greater than signs, then the DECsystem20 account names are
matched.

RSMHLP.FOR##The FORTRAN source code which produces the help messages
which can be typed by the RESUME program.  This file is produced by
using the FORMAT program to process the rough form of the messages
in the RSMHLP.RNO file.  The RSMQUO.FOR file contains the same messages
specified in apostrophe notation, rather than the H notation in which
they appear in the RSMHLP.FOR file.
.skip.test page 3.indent -12
RSMHLP.RNO##The rough form of the help messages which can be typed
by the RESUME program.  This must be processed by the FORMAT program
to produce FORTRAN source code which can be loaded with the RESUME
program.  The version of the FORMAT program which is used must be from
the summer of 1983 or later.

RSMPSW.RNO##A file which can be processed by the FROFF word processor,
together with one of the files produced by the RSMPSW program, to
produce form letters which can be given to the students telling them
what their passwords will be.  The description in this file of the
account to be used will have to be changed.

RSMQUO.FOR##A version of the FORTRAN source code which produces the
help messages.  These messages are specified in apostrophe notation,
rather than the H notation in which they appear in the RSMHLP.FOR file.
The RSMQUO.FOR file was produced by inserting a _.USE' command into
the RSMHLP.RNO file before it was processed using the FORMAT program.
