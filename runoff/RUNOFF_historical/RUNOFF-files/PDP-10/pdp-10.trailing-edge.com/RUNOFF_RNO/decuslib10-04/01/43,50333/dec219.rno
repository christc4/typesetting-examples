Were all files present and complete? If not, which files or
parts thereof were missing?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
The source file was the only file included or needed.
.S 1

Were all files readable in the format you requested?
If not, indicate the format requested for the programs and
describe the problems you had.

Yes.

Does the documentation accompanying the program meet or
exceed the standard? If not, what improvements are required?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Documentation was adequate.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Is the documentation complete?  (Are there unstated
restrictions or features?  If so, please indicate them.)
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
I believe so.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Is the documentation easy to use?  Suggest reasonable
reorganization if possible.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Yes.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Is the program abstract in the catalog accurate in its
description of the program?  What amendments would you
suggest?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Yes.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Are there "dangerous" features which installation management
might want to disable before putting the program onto
a system?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
No.

.LM 10;.LE
Did the program files all compile without errors?  If not,
list the names of files which did not compile or attach
listings of the compilations.  Also include the name and
version of the compiler.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Not compiled (see below).
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Did the program files load correctly? List names of
missing global references. Include the name and version of
the compiler.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
(not applicable)
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Can the loading process be revised to take advantage
of the LINK overlay feature to produce programs
which run more efficiently?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
(not applicable)
.S 1

If you loaded the ".REL" files you created, did the ".SAV"
OR ".SHR" files distributed match the file you created?

<RESPONSE:
(not applicable)
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Does the program perform as documented? List any
undocumented program error messages or monitor error
messages you discovered.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Not run (see below).
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
List deficiencies which might be easily remedied or any
error-detecting which should be implemented within the
program.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Not run (see below).
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Is the program easy to use? Are the commands or input
data formats ambiguous?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Not run (see below).
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Is the program documented internally well enough for a user
to make minor changes easily if necessary?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
Probably.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
If you have made improvements to the programs or
documentation (if it is machine-readable) which might be
of general use, please attach the changed files as you now
have them and a FILCOM between your version and the
distributed version.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
None.

.S 1;.UC;.LS
.LM 10;.LE
Does the program provide the same service as programs
already available on the DECsystem-10? Which ones?
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
In a way.  A program could easily be written in BASIC or AID in a few minutes
to perform the same function.
.S 1
.LM 10;.LE
Please enter below any general comments you have about
the program or its documentation.
.S 1
<RESPONSE:
This is essentially a "toy" program.
The program was not run, since it is written in FOCAL, and there has
never been any interest in FOCAL at this site.  We would not put
up FOCAL just to run this program.  It appears to do what it claims,
but a program could be written in BASIC or AID to do the same in a
very short time.  It is too bad that the program was not
written in BASIC.  If the "extended summary" feature is not used,
a calculator would be easier to use than this program.
