	<COMPAR IS  A PART OF <SOUPR (SEE <SOUPR.DOC).
	^THE INPUT TO <COMPAR CONSISTS
OF TWO <ASCII FILES KNOWN
AS THE BASE FILE AND THE USER FILE. <COMPAR WILL
COMPARE THE TWO FILES AND CREATE A CORRECTION
FILE. ^THE CORRECTION FILE DETAILS
HOW THE USER FILE DIFFERS FROM THE BASE FILE.
.B 1
^THE COMMAND FORMAT IS:
.BR
_.^R <COMPAR
.BR
*COR-SPEC=BASE-SPEC,USER-SPEC_/SWITCHES
.B 1
^SWITCHES:
.LM 16
.TS 16
.I -16
/<BASE	^DO WILDCARDING ON THE BASE-SPEC
.I -16
/<BLANK	^IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE /<MATCH SWITCH, THE /<BLANK
SWITCH DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT BLANK LINES SHOULD BE COUNTED.
/<BLANK MEANS THAT BLANK LINES SHOULD BE COUNTED, AND /<NOBLANK
MEANS THAT BLANK LINES SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED.
^THE DEFAULT IS /<NOBLANK.
.BREAK
<^EXAMPLE: ^SUPPOSE WE USE THE SWITCHES /<MATCH:3/NOBLANK.
^SUPPOSE A SEQUENCE OF 6 LINES IN THE BASE FILE IS EXACTLY EQUAL TO
A SEQUENCE OF 6 LINES IN THE USER FILE, BUT 4 OF THESE 6 LINES ARE
BLANK.
^THIS SEQUENCE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A MATCH.
^THERE ARE ONLY 2 NON-BLANK LINES THAT MATCH, AND THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED
TO BE SUFFICIENT. THERE MUST BE AT LEAST 3 NON-BLANK LINES THAT MATCH.
.BREAK
^NOTE THAT A BLANK LINE IS DEFINED AS ANY SEQUENCE OF SPACES, TABS,
AND CARRIAGE RETURNS FOLLOWED BY A BREAK CHARACTER.
.BREAK
^NOTE THAT THE USE OF /<NOBLANK DOES NOT MEAN THAT BLANK LINES
ARE IGNORED. ^A BLANK LINE IN THE BASE FILE MUST COMPARE IDENTICALLY
WITH THE BLANK LINE IN THE USER FILE (DIFFERENCES IN WHITE SPACE
ARE NOT IGNORED). ^THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF 6 LINES FROM THE BASE FILE
MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL TO THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF 6 LINES FROM THE
USER FILE. ^THE /<NOBLANK SWITCH DOES NOT MEAN THAT BLANK LINES ARE
IGNORED, IT MEANS ONLY THAT THEY ARE NOT COUNTED WHEN DETERMINING
THE TRESHOLD FOR /<MATCH.
.I -16
/<EXIT	^EXIT TO MONITOR (SAME AS _^^Z)
.I -16
/<HELP	^TYPE THIS TEXT
.I -16
/<LETTER	^THIS SWITCH IS SIMILAR TO /<NUMBER EXCEPT THAT
INSTEAD OF A NUMERIC SUFFIX, AN ALPHABETIC SUFFIX IS USED.
^FOR EXAMPLE, </NAME:9347/LETTER WILL LABEL THE
EDITS AS <9347A, <9347B, <9347C, ETC.
.I -16
/<LOG	^LOG FILE NAMES (DEFAULT)
.I -16
/<MATCH:<N	^A DISSIMILARITY DOES
NOT END UNTIL N LINES MATCH.
^THE DEFAULT IS 3.
.I -16
/<NAME:<FOO	^EACH PATCH IS
LABELED WITH THE SIXBIT
NAME FOO. ^WHEN CORRECTION
FILES ARE MERGED, THIS
LABEL  CAN BE USED TO
IDENTIFY THE ORIGIN OF
THE PATCH. ^LABELS
CAN ALSO BE USED AS CONDITIONALS.
.I -16
/<NAME:<"STRING"	^EACH PATCH IS
LABELED WITH THE <ASCII STRING.
^ONLY THE FIRST WORD IS SIGNIFICANT
FOR CONDITIONALS.
.I -16
/<NOBASE	^SAME AS /<USER
.I -16
/<NOBLANK	^DO NOT COUNT BLANK LINES (DEFAULT).
.I -16
/<NOLETT	^DON'T USE ALPHABETIC SUFFIXES (DEFAULT).
.I -16
/<NOLOG	^DON'T LOG FILE NAMES
.I -16
/<NONUMB	^DON'T USE NUMERIC SUFFIXES (DEFAULT).
.I -16
/<NOUSER	^SAME AS /<BASE
.I -16
/<NUMBER	^IN ADDITION TO LABELING THE EDITS, NUMBER
THEM AS WELL. ^FOR EXAMPLE, </NAME:FOO/NUMBER WILL LABEL THE
EDITS AS <FOO1, <FOO2, <FOO3, ETC.
.I -16
/<USER	^DO WILDCARDING ON THE USER-SPEC (DEFAULT)

8.	^CONSIDER THE FILES: <A.MAC, <B.MAC, <C.MAC, <A.NEW, AND <B.NEW.
^THE COMMAND <*.COR=*.MAC,*.NEW/BASE WILL PRODUCE AN ERROR MESSAGE
BECAUSE <C.NEW DOES NOT EXIST. ^THE COMMAND <*.COR=*.MAC,*.NEW/USER, HOWEVER,
WE PROCEED WITHOUT ERROR.
