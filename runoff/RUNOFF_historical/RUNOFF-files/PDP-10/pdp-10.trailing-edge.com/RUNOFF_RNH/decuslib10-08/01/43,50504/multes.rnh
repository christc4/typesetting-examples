 ^IF THE DISTURBANCES ARE MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT AND NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED 
(WITH ^E(E)#=#0 AND VAR(E)#=#^ISIGMA_^2) AND WITH A (PRESET) LEVEL OF 
SIGNIFI- CANCE ALPHA, A SIGNIFICANCE TEST FOR A PARTICULAR 
REGRESSION COEFFICIENT CAN BE PERFORMED, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY:
THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS:
.SK;.I10;^H0: AI = 0 (GIVEN THAT ALL OTHER AJ ARE IN THE MODEL),
.SK;WHICH IS TESTED AGAINST THE ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:
.SK;.I10;^H1: AI IS NOT EQUAL TO ZERO,
.SK;BY TREATING ^F^RI = BI_^2/VAR(BI) AS A REALIZATION OF A ^FISHER(1,N-P) VARIATE.
 ^HOWEVER, THIS TEST MUST BE USED WITH CAUTION, BECAUSE WITH THE (PRESET) 
LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE ALPHA, ONLY ONE COEFFICIENT CAN BE TESTED 
PROPERLY, WHILE THE COMPUTER OUTPUT LISTS STATISTICS FOR ALL COEFFICIENTS.
^IT SEEMS VERY TEMPTING TO TEST THE COEFFICIENTS SERIALLY ONE AT A TIME, 
BUT ONE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT IN DOING SO THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE 
OF THE WHOLE TEST RISES ABOVE THE NOMINAL VALUE.

.TS16,22,40,54,64
 ^IN THE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TABLE THE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TOTAL 
UNCORRECTED SUM OF SQUARES <Y'Y (WHICH IS THE FIRST PART IN THE TABLE) ARE GIVEN. 
 ^THE SECOND PART OF THE TABLE ASSUMES THE PRESENCE OF AN (UNKNOWN) CONSTANT 
TERM IN THE MODEL; IF THIS TERM IS ABSENT, THE 'MEAN'-LINE 
DISAPPEARS AND IN THE 'REGRESSION'-LINE P-1 CHANGES INTO P AND 
B'^X'^Y-NU_^2 CHANGES INTO B'^X'^Y.
 ^THE THIRD PART OF THE TABLE IS ONLY PRESENT WHEN REPEATED OBSERVATIONS 
FOR THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE ARE AVAILABLE, IN WHICH CASE:
.BR;K##IS THE NUMBER OF GROUPS OF REPLICATIONS,
.BR;MI IS THE NUMBER OF REPLICATIONS IN GROUP I, AND
.BR;^W = (W1,...,WK)', WITH WI = ^SUM(J,1,MI,YIJ) / ^SQRT(MI), FOR I = 1,...,K.
 ^THE FOURTH PART OF THE TABLE IS ONLY PRESENT IF A REDUCTION 
IS REQUESTED AND POSSIBLE. <SSQ THEN STANDS FOR THE RESIDUAL SUM 
OF SQUARES FROM A REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH THE FIRST P-Q OUT OF THE
P INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (1 _<= Q _<= P-1),
WHILE <SSE STANDS FOR THE RESIDUAL SUM OF SQUARES FROM A REGRESSION 
ANALYSIS WITH THE ORIGINAL P INDEPENDENT VARIABLES.
