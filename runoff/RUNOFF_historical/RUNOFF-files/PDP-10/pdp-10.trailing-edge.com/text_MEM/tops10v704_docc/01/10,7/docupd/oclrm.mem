|            This manual describes  the  commands  an  operator
|            needs.  These include commands to the OPR program,
|            the OPSER program, and the monitor  commands  that
|            require operator privileges.  It also includes the
|            following OPR command subsets:   CATALOG,  CONFIG,
|            LCP, NCP, QUOTA.

   1.1  INTRODUCTION TO OPR   1.1  INTRODUCTION TO OPR

   The Operator Command Language (OPR) enables you  to  communicate  with
   the programs that make up the GALAXY batch and spooling system.  These
   programs are:

         o  QUASAR, the  nucleus  of  the  GALAXY  and  mountable  device
            allocation systems

         o  BATCON, the batch job controller

         o  CATALOG, the system catalog manager

         o  LPTSPL, the line printer spooler

         o  CDRIVE, the card reader spooler

         o  SPRINT, the reader interpreter

         o  SPROUT, the card punch, paper tape punch, and plotter spooler

         o  PULSAR, the label processor for tapes and structures

         o  NEBULA, the output job router between DECnet nodes

         o  QUEUE, the user interface to submit print and batch jobs

   In addition, you use  OPR  to  communicate  with  programs  requesting
   operator  action,  such  as  the  PLEASE program, or with users on the
   system.

   The program that receives the OPR commands and communicates  with  all
   the  other  system programs is ORION.  ORION also logs messages in the
   operator's log file, OPERAT.LOG.

                                RUNNING OPR


   1.2  RUNNING OPR   1.2  RUNNING OPR

   To run OPR, you must have one of the following privileges.  (See  your
   system manager to obtain one of these privileges if you do not already
   have them.)

        1.  SYSTEM operator  privileges,  which  enable  you  to  control
            devices and tasks on the host system and on any remote nodes.

        2.  HOST operator privileges, which enable you to control devices
            and tasks at your local host system only.

        3.  REMOTE operator  privileges,  which  enable  you  to  control
            devices  and  tasks  at the remote station node where you are
            located.

   The tasks in this chapter and in following chapters  assume  that  you
   have  more  than  one terminal available to perform them.  If you have
   more than one terminal available to you, you may want to dedicate  one
   terminal  to  running  only  OPR,  and  use another terminal for other
   tasks, for example, running BACKUP.

   The following sections explain how to start and exit from OPR.



   1.2.1  Starting OPR   1.2.1  Starting OPR

   To start OPR type the following:

         _ ________        .R OPR<RET>

        OPR>

   If your installation has  more  than  one  terminal  assigned  to  its
   operators,  you  can  run separate OPRs from different terminals.  All
   OPRs work the same way.  ORION, OPR's controlling program, can  handle
   an unlimited number of OPRs.



   1.2.2  Exiting from OPR   1.2.2  Exiting from OPR

   To exit from OPR, press <CTRL/Z> or type EXIT.  OPR returns  your  job
   to  monitor  command  level.  The period prompt (.) indicates that you
   are at monitor command level.  For example:

            _________        OPR>EXIT<RET>

        .

   1.2.3  Issuing OPR Commands to/from Remote Stations   1.2.3  Issuing OPR Commands to/from Remote Stations

   The system operator at the host system has control  of  all  jobs  and
   devices  at  all nodes within the network system.  If you are a Remote
   Station Operator, you can control only  the  devices  at  your  remote
   station.   In addition, you have complete control over all active jobs
   and jobs queued for devices at your node.  All your  commands  default
   to  your  location  or  node.  Some OPR commands, however, include the
   /NODE switch which enables you to send commands to other nodes in  the
   network.   The /NODE switch is available with many of the OPR commands
   described in later sections of this manual.  The /NODE  switch  allows
   you  to  specify  the  logical identifier of any remote station or any
   node in the network system.  The format of the /NODE switch is:

        /NODE:node-id

         _______   where node-id is the number or the name of the remote station.



   1.2.4  Multiple Operators on the System   1.2.4  Multiple Operators on the System

   You can have more than one OPR running on the same  operating  system.
   ORION   keeps   track   of   each   OPR   and  sends  the  appropriate
   acknowledgement messages to the OPR who sent the command.

   If you have networking software at your installation, messages sent to
   a node from a user (with the SEND OPR monitor command) are sent to all
   OPRs running on the node.

   You can enable or disable messages displayed at each terminal  running
   OPR.   See  Section  1.7.1  for information on controlling OPR message
   output.



   1.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES   1.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES

   OPR has features that enable you to:

         o  List available commands

         o  Use ESCape recognition

         o  Obtain help text

         o  Reprint faulty commands

         o  Continue long command lines

   The following sections describe these command features in detail.

                            OPR COMMAND FEATURES


   In addition, other CTRL/character commands, such  as  CTRL/R,  CTRL/U,
   and  CTRL/W,  function  at  OPR  command  level  as they do at monitor
   command level.

                                    NOTE

           These OPR command features are not applicable when OPR
           is a subjob of OPSER.



   1.3.1  Listing Available Commands   1.3.1  Listing Available Commands

   To list all available OPR commands, type a question mark  (?)  to  the
   OPR>  prompt.   You  can  type  ?   whenever you need help with an OPR
   command.  For example:

         o  When you type ?  while entering a command, OPR lists  command
            keywords, arguments, or switches for the OPR command and then
            redisplays your OPR command up to the point where  you  typed
            the ?.

         o  When you type  ?   after  the  OPR>  prompt,  OPR  lists  the
            available commands.

         o  When you type ?  after an OPR command, OPR lists the keywords
            to that command and redisplays the command.

         o  When you type ?  after the keyword,  OPR  lists  the  values,
            arguments, and/or switches to that keyword and redisplays the
            command and keywords up to the point where you typed ?.

         o  When you type ?  after an entire OPR  command,  OPR  displays
            the  message  "Confirm with carriage return", redisplays your
            entire command, and waits for you to press the RETURN key.

   Example

   After you have started OPR and the system displays  the  OPR>  prompt,
   type ?.

         _ ___ _____        .R OPR <RET>

   1.3.2  Using ESCape Recognition   1.3.2  Using ESCape Recognition

   ESCape recognition helps you to enter commands by:

         o  Completing command keywords and switches to  the  point  that
            they become unambiguous with other keywords and switches

         o  Allowing you to type shortened versions of commands

         o  Providing guide words that prompt you for more information

   You can press the  ESCape  key  as  soon  as  you  have  typed  enough
   characters  to  uniquely  identify  a  command  to OPR.  The number of
   characters necessary for OPR to accept the command varies and requires
   some experimentation on your part.

                                    NOTE

           The terminal bell rings when you press the ESCape  key
           if  you  have  not typed enough characters to uniquely
           identify a command.  If  this  happens,  type  another
           character  and  press  the ESCape key.  Continue to do
           this until the characters you have  typed  identify  a
           specific command.

   The following keyword table and dialog illustrate the  ESCape  command
   completion feature:

        DEVICE-A-TABLE-OFF

        2.  Type A<ESC>.

                ______      ______            OPR>D<ESC>EVICE-A<ESC>-TABLE-O

            OPR responds by providing "-TABLE-O" and then beeps.

        3.  Type F<ESC>.

                ______      ______        ______            OPR>D<ESC>EVICE-A<ESC>-TABLE-OF<ESC>F

            OPR responds by providing  "F"  and  completes  the  keyword,
            "DEVICE-A-TABLE-OFF".

   The following example illustrates the ESCape recognition feature:

        1.  Type the ABORT command.

        2.  Press the ESCape key to display the ABORT guide words.   (The
            characters <ESC> are not echoed on your terminal.)

   When you issue a correct command to OPR, OPR  passes  the  command  to
   ORION.   If  the  command is incorrect, OPR displays an error message.
   If you receive an  error  message,  you  can  retype  the  entire  OPR
   command,  or  press  <CTRL/H>  to  reprint the command up to the point
   where the error occurred.

   To use the <CTRL/H> feature do the following:

        1.  Press <CTRL/H> to redisplay the command up to the point where
            the  error  occured.   (The characters <CTRL/H> and <ESC> are
            not echoed on your terminal.)

   1.3.4  Getting Help   1.3.4  Getting Help

   The OPR HELP command provides  information  about  specific  commands.
   When  you type HELP, followed by an OPR command name, OPR displays the
   command's function and its format, keywords, arguments, and switches.

   The following example illustrates the HELP feature:

   If you specify  HELP  RELEASE,  OPR  displays  the  function,  format,
   keywords, and arguments of the RELEASE command.

            _________       _______ _____        OPR>HELP<ESC>(with) RELEASE <RET>

   The RELEASE command allows you to release a job request that was  held
   with the HOLD command.  The format is:

        RELEASE keyword

         _______   where keyword must be one of the following:

        BATCH-JOBS
        CARD-PUNCH-JOBS
        PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH-JOBS
        PLOTTER-JOBS

   1.3.5  Line Continuation   1.3.5  Line Continuation

   Commands to OPR are often long and cumbersome, especially if  you  use
   ESCape recognition.  The OPR program enables you to continue a command
   on the next line.  To continue a  command  line,  type  a  hyphen  (-)
   before  you  press  <RET>.  This prevents OPR from processing the line
   until it reaches a <RET> that is not preceded by a hyphen.  (You  must
   include  the  entire  command  name,  keyword, argument, or switch and
   value before you type the hyphen.)

   1.4  CONTROLLING SYSTEM EVENTS   1.4  CONTROLLING SYSTEM EVENTS

   OPR  enables  you  to  control  certain  system  activities  known  as
   "events".  These events are:

         o  Billing file closure (BILCLS)

         o  Scheduled system shutdown (KSYS)

         o  ORION log file closure (OPRFIL)

         o  Command file execution (TAKFIL)

         o  Usage file closure (USGFIL)

   You can use the following commands to control system events:

         o  CLOSE

         o  SET KSYS

        NOW                causes the event to occur immediately.

        +hh:mm:ss          schedules the event to occur in the number  of
                           hours  from  the current time, as specified by
                           hh:mm:ss.  (Specifies a relative time for  the
                           event to occur.)

        hh:mm:ss           schedules the  event  to  occur  at  the  time
                           specified by hh:mm:ss.  (Specifies an absolute
                           time for the event to occur.)

        dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss

                           schedules the event to occur on the  date  and
                           time specified by dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss.

        DAILY hh:mm:ss     schedules the event to occur every day at  the
                           time specified by hh:mm:ss.

        EVERY "DAY" hh:mm:ss

                           schedules the event to occur every week on the
                           day  and  time  you  specify.  DAY specifies a
                           particular day of the week.

   Other commands that control system events  are  the  CANCEL  and  SHOW
   QUEUES EVENTS commands.



   1.5  CONTROLLING FAL   1.5  CONTROLLING FAL

   FAL, the File Access Listener, provides network remote access  to  the
   TOPS-10   file   system,   and   is   an   integral  part  of  network
   communications.  FAL makes network  file  transfers  possible  in  the
   following ways:

         o  It acts as a target for NFT (Network File Transfer)  programs
            on other DECnet and ANF-10 hosts.

         o  It determines a user's access privileges to a requested file.

                              CONTROLLING FAL


   You can  use  the  following  OPR  commands  to  control  the  network
   connections known as FAL-STREAMS:

         o  SET

         o  START

         o  ABORT

         o  STOP

         o  CONTINUE

         o  DEFINE

   These commands function  much  as  the  commands  that  control  batch
   streams.   For  example,  to  define the type of network (DECnet) with
   which FAL stream 2 will communicate, use the SET command as follows:

   1.6  CONTROLLING NQC STREAMS   1.6  CONTROLLING NQC STREAMS

   The Network  Queue  Controller  (NQC),  using  the  Distributed  Queue
   Service  (DQS)  protocol,  allows  output  requests  to be sent to the
   output queue of a remote node.

   NQC streams control spooling requests for the  NEBULA  remote  queuing
   software.    Current   versions   of  NEBULA  run  as  internal  ORION
   applications that are available with the standard monitor distribution
   and GALAXY CUSPs.  However, in order to implement remote queuing, your
   system must be running DECnet-10 Version 3 and the remote queuing node
   must be a VAX/VMS system running DQS software Version 1.0, or later.

   You can use the following OPR commands to control NQC streams:

         o  ABORT           - Terminates active NQC stream requests

         o  CONTINUE        - Continues stopped NQC stream requests

         o  DEFINE          - Defines network nodes and remote queues for
                              NQC streams.

   1.7  ORION TO OPR MESSAGES   1.7  ORION TO OPR MESSAGES

   ORION to OPR messages are one of the two types of  messages  displayed
   on  your  OPR  terminal,  the  other  type are OPR messages indicating
   errors in your  commands  (see  Section  1.8).   The  types  of  ORION
   messages displayed are:

         o  Error  messages  showing  that  ORION  does  not   have   the
            appropriate  devices,  streams,  nodes,  or jobs to process a
            command

         o  Messages from jobs that start processing in a stream or on  a
            device

         o  Messages from jobs that end processing in a stream  or  on  a
            device

         o  Messages  specifying  actions  you  must  take  for   various
            devices, streams, or jobs

         o  Messages to which you must RESPOND

         o  Results from TAKE command files

   The first eight characters of the message ORION displays is  the  time
   stamp.  ORION time-stamps each OPR command it accepts and executes, as
   well as all error messages.

   In the following example, ORION displays the time (in hours,  minutes,
   and seconds) that it accepted and executed the SET PRINTER command.

            ___ _______ _ __________ ______ _____        OPR>SET PRINTER 0 FORMS-TYPE NARROW <RET>

                           ORION TO OPR MESSAGES


   ORION displays error messages in the same format.   In  the  following
   example,  ORION  acknowledges  the SHOW MESSAGES command by displaying
   the information message shown below:

            ____ ________ _____        OPR>SHOW MESSAGES <RET>

        12:00:00        -- No Outstanding Messages --

   When a particular job starts to process in a  batch  stream  or  on  a
   device,  ORION  displays  a  message  to notify you that the stream or
   device is active.  For example, ORION displays the  following  message
   when  a  job  named  TEST begins to process in batch stream 0 for user
   ZINA:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  -- Begin --
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA [27,1234]

        OPR>

   Likewise, when a particular job  ends  processing,  ORION  displays  a
   message  to notify you that the stream or device is not active and the
   job has completed.  For example, ORION displays the following  message
   when  a  job  named  TEST  ends the process in batch stream 0 for user
   ZINA.

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  -- End --
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA [27,1234]

   1.7.1  Controlling OPR Message Output   1.7.1  Controlling OPR Message Output

   You may want to control  the  types  of  messages  displayed  at  your
   terminal.   For  example,  if you have multiple terminals running OPR,
   you can set the OUTPUT-DISPLAY to suit the  needs  of  each  OPR.   To
   control  OPR  message  output,  enter  the  ENABLE  or DISABLE command
   followed by the keyword,  OUTPUT-DISPLAY,  and  one  or  more  of  the
   following arguments:

        ALL-MESSAGES (the default argument)
        BATCH-MESSAGES
        CARD-PUNCH-MESSAGES
        CARD-READER-INTERPRETER-MESSAGES
        FAL-MESSAGES
        MOUNT-MESSAGES
        PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH-MESSAGES
        PLOTTER-MESSAGES
        PRINTER-MESSAGES
        READER-MESSAGES
        USER-MESSAGES

                           ORION TO OPR MESSAGES


   The  ENABLE  and  DISABLE  commands  also  have  the  following  three
   switches.  If you do not specify one of these switches with one of the
   above arguments, the system assumes all three types of messages.

        /INFORMATION-MESSAGES
        /JOB-MESSAGES
        /OPR-ACTION-MESSAGES

   Because the default is ALL-MESSAGES,  you  must  disable  ALL-MESSAGES
   then  enable the specific types of messages you want to see.  For more
   information about these commands and switches see Chapter 2.



   1.8  OPR ERROR MESSAGE DESCRIPTIONS   1.8  OPR ERROR MESSAGE DESCRIPTIONS

   OPR error messages are also displayed on your terminal.  All OPR error
   messages begin with "?" and are followed by the message explaining the
   error.  Note that "?" does not represent a fatal error in OPR,  as  it
   does in some other system programs.

   When you receive an OPR error message, you can type <CTRL/H> to retype
   your  OPR  command  up  to  the  point where you entered the incorrect
   keyword, switch, or  value  and  specify  the  correct  input  to  the
   command.

   Each error message described in this section gives an  explanation  of
   the cause of the error message and the possible solution.


   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous

   Reason:        You issued an OPR command, but  did  not  complete  it.
                  For  example,  you  may  have  left  out  the necessary
                  keyword or switch that would make the  command  execute
                  properly.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the necessary keyword or switch.


   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous switch or keyword

   This chapter describes each of the OPR commands in  detail.   All  OPR
   commands  must end with a carriage return (that is, you must press the
   key labeled RETURN or CR).

   There are seven possible headings in each command description.   These
   headings  are  listed  and  explained  in  the  following text and are
   omitted when not applicable to the command:

        Function            Contains  one  or   two   sentences   briefly
                            describing what the command does.

        Format              Describes  the   syntax   of   the   command,
                            including   its   command   name,   keywords,
                            switches, and switch values.

        Keywords            Describes the attributes or values that  must
                            be supplied with the command.

        Switches            Describes the attributes that are preceded by
                            a  slash  (/) and are optional to the command
                            string.  Switches that have values  can  also
                            have default values (supplied by <ESC>).

        Arguments           Describes  the  additional   attributes   and
                            values  that  are  optional  to  the  command
                            string.  An argument that takes a  value  (or
                            word)  can  also  have  a  default  value (or
                            word)(supplied by <ESC>).

        Restrictions        Describes the limitations  and  peculiarities
                            of  the  command.   It  also  explains common
                            error messages you can  receive  while  using
                            the command.

        Examples            Shows a few common ways to use the command.

   Keywords

        BATCH-STREAM       aborts the specified batch  stream.   A  batch
                           stream  is  a  pseudo-terminal  that interacts
                           with the system to execute a batch job.

        CARD-PUNCH         aborts the specified card punch job.

        FAL-STREAM         aborts the specified FAL stream.

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies the stream number of the batch, NQC,
                           or  FAL  stream  to  be  aborted,  or the unit
                           number of  the  input/output  device  that  is
                           currently  processing a job.  You must specify
                           an argument.

        n:m                specifies a range of stream or unit numbers.


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies a remote node for which the  command
                           will   be   effective.    For   example,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026 to specify the node named KL1026.
                           If  you do not specify a node identifier, your
                           own node is the default.  Note that you cannot
                           abort jobs at a remote host node.

        /ERROR-PROCESSING  specifies that any error  recovery  procedures
                           specified  by the user who submitted the batch
                           job will not be ignored.

        /NOERROR-PROCESSING

                           specifies that any error  recovery  procedures
                           provided  by  the user who submitted the batch
                           job be ignored when the batch job is aborted.

        /PURGE             aborts the specified job and all  output  from
                           the  job.   When you purge a batch-stream job,
                           no log file is printed.

        /REASON:comment    allows you to include a comment explaining why
                           the  request  has been canceled.  This comment
                           appears in the  batch  log  file  and  at  the
                           user's  terminal.   If  the  comment is longer
                           than one line, type a hyphen before you  press
                           RETURN  and  continue  the comment on the next
                           line.  If you press RETURN  immediately  after
                           the  colon, OPR responds with the instruction:
                           ENTER TEXT AND TERMINATE  WITH  ^Z.   You  can
                           then enter as many lines of text as necessary.
                           When your comment is complete, press <CTRL/Z>.

                                   ABORT


   Restrictions

        The only switches available to the READER keyword are  the  /NODE
        and  /REASON  switches,  because a card reader input job does not
        become a request until the last card ($EOJ card) has been read.

        The only switch available to the NQC-STREAM keyword is /NODE.

        The /ERROR-PROCESSING and /NOERROR-PROCESSING switches are  valid
        only with the BATCH-STREAM keyword.


   Examples

        1.  Use the ABORT command  to  abort  a  batch  stream  job  with
            NOERROR-PROCESSING  because  you  were instructed to do so by
            the user who submitted the job.

   2.2  ALIGN   2.2  ALIGN




   Function

        The ALIGN command prints a "forms-alignment" file  repeatedly  on
        the line printer so that you can align the paper.

        You may have to align special forms for a particular line-printer
        job,  such  as  payroll  checks  or  invoices.  The ALIGN command
        allows you to adjust the forms and the line printer as many times
        as necessary to print the job correctly.


   Format

        OPR>ALIGN keyword nn /switch (or) argument<RET>


   Keyword

        PRINTER nn         specifies the  line  printer  (output  device)
                           unit  number  (nn)  that  will print the forms
                           alignment file (for example, 0 for LPT0, 1 for
                           LPT1,  and  so  forth).   You must specify the
                           PRINTER keyword and the unit number.


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

        /PAUSE:nnnn        specifies the time in seconds (nnnn) that  the
                           line  printer  waits  between  repeats  of the
                           particular print  job.   The  default  of  the
                           /PAUSE switch is 10 seconds.

        /REPEAT-COUNT:nnnn

                           specifies the number of  times  to  print  the
                           file   (starting  from  the  beginning).   The
                           default value of the /REPEAT-COUNT is 25.

        /STOP              specifies that normal printing be resumed  and
                           stops  the  alignment  of  forms  on  the line
                           printer.

   Argument

        alignment-filespec

                           specifies a file to be  printed  for  aligning
                           the  forms.  The default file specification is
                           SYS:formsname.ALP, where formsname is the name
                           of  the  form  to  be aligned, such as NARROW.
                           This  alignment  file  has  a  format  of  one

   Restrictions

        If you specify the ALIGN command and the alignment file cannot be
        found, the following error message appears:

             hh:mm:ss        Printer n  -- Alignment Error --
                        Cannot read ALIGN file 'filespec'

        If you specify the ALIGN command with the /STOP switch while  the
        print request is printing, the following error message appears:

             hh:mm:ss        Printer n  -- /STOP Illegal --
                        Alignment not in Progress

        If you specify  the  ALIGN  command  while  an  alignment  is  in
        progress, the following error message appears:

             hh:mm:ss        Printer n  -- Alignment already in Progress --


   Examples

        1.  Specify line printer 0 in the ALIGN  command  to  align  some
            special forms and specify a repeat-count of 15.

   Function

        The BACKSPACE command reprints pages in the file currently  being
        printed on the line printer.

        You may have to backspace a file that is currently being  printed
        on  the  line printer, if the forms become jammed in the printing
        mechanism.  The BACKSPACE command allows  you  to  backspace  the
        print  file  so  that  the  pages of the file that were jammed or
        incorrectly printed can be repeated.


   Format

        PRINTER nn         specifies the  line  printer  (output  device)

                           backspace the  file  currently  being  printed
                           (for  example,  0 for LPT0, 1 for LPT1, and so
                           forth).  You must  specify  the  unit  number;
                           there is no default.


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

                                 BACKSPACE


        You must specify one of the following switches:

        /COPIES:nnnn       specifies the number of additional  copies  to
                           be  printed.   The number you specify is added
                           to the number of copies that the  user  queued
                           with  the  PRINT  command.   For example, if a
                           user issues the command:

                                PRINT FOO.BAR/COPIES:25

                           and  you  issue  the  BACKSPACE  command  with
                           /COPIES:10  while  FOO.BAR is being printed on
                           the line printer, the total number  of  copies
                           printed will be 35.

        /FILE              specifies that one file be backspaced  when  a
                           multi-file  PRINT  request has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command:

                                PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the BACKSPACE command with /FILE
                           while  FOO3.BAR  is  being printed on the line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR will be printed again.

        /PAGES:nnnn        specifies the number of pages to be backspaced
                           for  the file that is currently being printed.
                           The  /PAGES  switch  is  the  default  of  the
                           BACKSPACE  command.   If  you  do  not specify
                           either the /COPIES or the /FILE  switch,  then
                           you  must  specify  the  /PAGES  switch.   The
                           number  you  specify  (nnnn)  refers  to   the
                           physical number of pages and not to the number
                           of disk pages used for storing the file.


   Examples

        1.  Specify line printer 0 in the BACKSPACE  command  to  add  an
            additional 15 copies to a print request of 15 copies.

   Restriction

        You cannot cancel mount requests after the tape or structure  has

   2.5  CLOSE   2.5  CLOSE




   Function

        The CLOSE command closes the current ORION log file, renames  it,
        and  creates a new log file.  The command arguments enable you to
        specify a date and time to close the ORION log file.

        The ORION log file, OPERAT.LOG, records all OPR-to-ORION commands
        and  transactions  performed at the operator's console.  When you
        issue  the  CLOSE  command,  OPR  transfers  these  commands  and
        transactions  to  the ORNLOG.nnn file and clears the buffer file,
        OPERAT.LOG.  You can then print the ORNLOG.nnn file to  obtain  a
        hard-copy of all the operating processes for a given time period.
        OPERAT.LOG  is  now  open  for  more  OPR-to-ORION  commands  and
        transactions.

        You may choose a name other than OPERAT.LOG  for  the  ORION  log

                           pseudo-terminal that interacts with the system
                           to execute a batch job.

        CARD-PUNCH         continues the specified card-punch  (or  range
                           of such devices).

        FAL-STREAM         continues a specified FAL stream or  range  of
                           FAL streams.  You may not use the /NODE switch
                           with this keyword.

        NQC-STREAM         continues a specified NQC stream or  range  of
                           NQC streams.

        PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH   continues the specified  paper-tape-punch  (or
                           range of such devices).

        PLOTTER            continues the specified plotter (or  range  of
                           such devices).

        PRINTER            continues the specified line-printer (or range
                           of such devices).

        READER             continues the specified card-reader (or  range

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies the stream number of the batch, NQC,
                           or  FAL  stream  to  be continued, or the unit
                           number of the  input/output  device  that  has
                           been  temporarily stopped.  You must specify a
                           stream/unit number.

        n:m                specifies a range of stream/unit numbers.  You
                           can  specify  this  range  instead of a single
                           stream/unit number.  The colon  must  separate
                           the   two   numbers.   The  n  represents  the
                           low-order number  and  the  m  represents  the
                           high-order number.


   Switch

        /NODE:identifier   specifies a remote node for which the  command
                           will  be  effective.   For example, to specify
                           the node named KL1026, use  /NODE:KL1026.   If
                           you do not specify a node identifier, your own
                           node is the default.

                           The HASP multileaving remote  station  is  the
                           default type.

        mode               specifies a host  or  a  remote  station  with
                           which  the  IBM node is to communicate.  Valid
                           communication modes are:

                           EMULATION      specifies a host.

                           TERMINATION    specifies a remote station.

                           TERMINATION  is  the  default   communications
                           mode.

        port               specifies the port number from the  front  end
                           to the TOPS-10 host.

        line               specifies the line number from the  front  end
                           to  the  modem  communicating  with the remote
                           site.

        /SIGNON-REQUIRED   specifies that the node  must  send  a  signon
                           card when starting up or starting a job.  This
                           is the default.

        /NO-SIGNON-REQUIRED

                           specifies that the node does not have to  send
                           a signon card.


   Restrictions

        For a KL10, the port number can be either 11 (for DTE1), 12  (for
        DTE2),  or  13  (for  DTE3).   For a KS10, the port number can be
        either 10 (for KMC/DMC line 0) or 11 (for KMC/DMC line  1).   For
        DL10s,  the  port numbers are in a range from 0 through 7.  Never
        use port 10 on a KL10.

        For a KL10, the line number must be from 0 to 5; for a KS10,  the
        line number must be either 0 or 1.

        If you specify a port number other than 11, 12, or 13, or a  line
        number  greater  than  5,  either of the following error messages
        appears:

             ?  First nonspace character is not a digit

   Keywords

        JOB-SCHEDULING     removes a specified CPU from the  system  pool
                           of  available  resources.  The CPU may perform
                           I/O, but it does not schedule user jobs.

        LOGGING            disables the centralized logging  facility  of
                           ORION.    (This  facility  logs  all  messages
                           passing  through  the  operating  system   and
                           stores  these  messages  in  a log file.) When
                           this  facility  is  disabled,  there  are   no
                           records  kept of the messages and interactions
                           between ORION and the  system.   However,  the
                           CTY shows all messages and interactions if you
                           have  not  DISABLEd  the   OUTPUT-DISPLAY   of
                           ALL-MESSAGES  at the CTY.  This keyword has no
                           additional arguments or switches.

        OUTPUT-DISPLAY     disables the display of specified messages  on
                           your  console.   The  message  types  are  the
                           arguments and switches to this keyword.

        QUEUES             disables all users from making queue  requests
                           for the specified devices.

        STRUCTURE-RECOGNITION

                           specifies that the system should not read  the
                           home blocks of all volumes of a structure when
                           it is mounted on a disk  drive.   The  DISABLE
                           STRUCTURE-RECOGNITION   command   affects  all
                           structures to be  mounted,  but  it  does  not
                           affect currently mounted structures.

        VOLUME-RECOGNITION

                           disables volume recognition for labeled  tapes
                           and structures.  Volume recognition allows you
                           to  mount  labeled  tapes  and  structures  on
                           tape/disk  drives  without  having to identify
                           the tape or structure  to  the  system.   When
                           volume  recognition  is  disabled  for  a disk
                           drive (or all disk drives), you must  use  the
                           RECOGNIZE  command  to  force  the  system  to
                           recognize the mounted structure.  When  volume
                           recognition  is  disabled for a tape drive (or
                           all tape drives), you must use  the  RECOGNIZE
                           command  to  force the system to recognize the
                           mounted labeled tape.  (The  IDENTIFY  command
                           is   for  unlabeled  tape  mounts.)  For  more
                           information, see the  IDENTIFY  and  RECOGNIZE
                           commands.

   2.11  DISMOUNT   2.11  DISMOUNT




   Function

        The DISMOUNT command  allows  you  to  dismount  (and  remove)  a
        structure  currently  mounted on a disk drive, or a magnetic tape
        currently mounted on a tape drive.

        When  you  issue  the  DISMOUNT  command  for  a  structure,  the
        structure is queued for removal.  If other users have mounted the
        structure,  a  message  appears  listing  statistics  about   the
        structure  and  asks  you  to  respond  with  ABORT to cancel the
        dismount, or PROCEED to permit the dismount.

        When you issue the DISMOUNT command for a tape  drive,  the  tape
        rewinds  itself completely from the take-up wheel, providing that
        no user is currently using the tape.  If a user is using the tape
        on  the  specified  tape  drive,  OPR  will  reject  the DISMOUNT
        command.


   Format

   Keywords

        STRUCTURE          specifies a disk structure  currently  mounted
                           on a disk drive.

        TAPE-DRIVE         specifies a tape drive  that  has  a  magnetic
                           tape mounted and ready on it.

   Arguments

        structure-name:    specifies the logical name of the structure to
                           be  dismounted and removed.  The colon must be
                           included with the  structure  name  specified.
                           An example of a logical name is DSKC:.

        tape-drive-name:   specifies the logical name of the  tape  drive
                           which   currently  has  the  desired  tape  to
                           dismount on it.  The colon  must  be  included
                           with  the tape drive name.  The name is in the
                           format  of  MTxn:,  where  x   is   the   tape
                           controller  identification  and  n is the tape
                           drive  number.   For  example,  MTA0:   is   a
                           magtape device name.

   Switches

        /NOCHECK           specifies  that  the  structure   is   to   be
                           dismounted   without  regard  to  the  current
                           status and/or users on  the  structure.   With
                           the /NOCHECK switch, the system does not check
                           the mount count of the structure or any  other
                           warning  conditions  and  you receive no error
                           messages.    The    dismount    is    executed
                           immediately.

        /REMOVE            specifies that the structure will be  removed.
                           With  the /REMOVE switch, the structure ceases
                           its   rotation   and   comes   to    a    stop
                           automatically,  so that you can remove it from
                           the disk drive.  Without the specification  of
                           the  /REMOVE  switch,  you must press the STOP
                           button on the drive to  stop  and  remove  the
                           structure.


   Restrictions

        When you issue a DISMOUNT command for a structure that is in  the
        Active  Swapping  List,  System  Search  List,  Crash  Dump List,
        contains the STRLST.SYS file, or has the [3,3] UFD directory, you
        receive  a  warning  message.  This message allows you to respond
        with either ABORT to cancel the dismount, or PROCEED  to  proceed
        with  the dismount.  In addition, this warning message appears if
        any other user has  requested  this  structure  mount  (refer  to
        Example 1).

        If there are other users who have mounted the structure  and  you
        really  wish  to remove the structure, it is recommended that you
        send a message to all users of the system before you respond with
        PROCEED,  to  allow  all  users  to  complete their tasks on that
        structure.

        You can  use  the  LOCK  command  to  prevent  other  users  from
        accessing  the  structure.   See the LOCK command description for
        more information.

                           default.
   Examples

        1.  You have previously disabled queue requests  to  allow  those
            requests  in  the  queues  to  be  processed  before  a shift
            turnover.  You can now enable queue requests.

        2.  You have started OPR on a  terminal  to  display  only  mount
            messages.   By default, when OPR is started, all messages are
            displayed.  Therefore, you must disable all messages and then
            enable mount messages.

        The ENTER command allows you to work with the  following  command
        subsets:

        Each of the  above  has  its  own  set  of  commands.   For  more
        information  about  these  command subsets see Chapter 3.  If you
        are unfamiliar with a command subset, do not attempt  to  use  it
        until you have read the appropriate section of Chapter 3.

        To exit from a command subset  use  either  the  RETURN  or  EXIT
        commands.   The  RETURN  command  returns your job to OPR command
        level.  The EXIT command returns  your  job  to  monitor  command
        level.

   Restriction

        Because OPR takes time to respond to some commands, the immediate
        action  of  the  EXIT  command may prevent you from seeing output
        from previously issued commands.  However, the processing of  the
        previous commands will not be interrupted when you EXIT from OPR.


   Examples

        1.  Use the EXIT command to  leave  OPR  and  return  to  monitor
            command level.

   Function

        The FORWARDSPACE command  spaces  the  print  file  on  the  line
        printer in a forward direction, so that you can skip the printing
        of a job, file, or page(s).  The FORWARDSPACE command allows  you
        to  forwardspace  the  print  file so that you can save paper and
        print only what is needed as output.

        You may have to forwardspace a particular file that is  currently
        printing  on  the  line  printer if, for example, a user requires
        only a portion of some printed output.


   Format

        PRINTER nn         specifies the line printer (output device) and
                           unit   number   to   forwardspace   the  forms
                           currently printing (for example, PRINTER 0 for
                           LPT0,  PRINTER 1 for LPT1, and so forth).  You
                           must specify  the  PRINTER  keyword  and  unit
                           number.


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

                                FORWARDSPACE


        You must specify one of the following switches:

        /COPIES:nnnn       specifies the number of copies to  be  skipped
                           over  printing.   The  number  you  specify is
                           subtracted from the  number  that  was  queued
                           with  the  PRINT  command.   For example, if a
                           user issued the command:

                           PRINT FOO.BAR/COPIES:25

                           and you issue the  FORWARDSPACE  command  with
                           /COPIES:10  while  FOO.BAR  is printing on the
                           line  printer,  the  total  number  of  copies
                           printed will be 15.

        /FILE              specifies to  forwardspace  one  file  when  a
                           multifile  PRINT  request  has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command:

                           PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the  FORWARDSPACE  command  with
                           /FILE  while  FOO1.BAR is printing on the line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR starts printing on the  line
                           printer.   The remaining pages of FOO1.BAR are
                           skipped.

        /PAGES:nnnn        specifies  the   number   of   pages   to   be
                           forwardspaced  for  the file that is currently

                           the /COPIES or the /FILE switch, then you must
                           specify the /PAGES  switch.   The  number  you
                           specify  (nnnn)  refers to the physical number
                           of pages and not to the number of  disk  pages

   2.18  IDENTIFY   2.18  IDENTIFY




   Function

        The IDENTIFY command allows you to service tape mount requests by
        enabling you to:

         o  Satisfy a user tape mount request for an unlabeled tape.

         o  Assign a volume identification (volid)  for  a  user  who  is
            writing on an unlabeled or labeled tape.

        When a user issues a mount request for  an  unlabeled  tape,  you
        must  physically locate, mount, and prepare the requested tape on
        an available tape drive and then identify the tape mount  request
        to the tape drive.

        If you have volume recognition enabled and your installation uses
        labeled  tapes, you do not need to use the IDENTIFY command after
        you mount and ready a tape on a tape drive.

                           is the tape drive number.  You must specify  a
                           colon at the end of the unit number.


   Arguments

        REQUEST-ID nn      specifies that you are attempting to  use  the

        VOLUME-ID volid    specifies the volume identifier (volid) of the

                           drive.  The volid can consist of from 1  to  6
                           alphanumeric   characters.    If   the   volid
                           contains      nonalphanumeric       characters
                           (characters  other  than  A  through  Z  and 0
                           through 9), the  volid  must  be  enclosed  in
                           double quotes.

           If someone mounts a tape  and  you  do  not  know  its
           identity, you can use the RECOGNIZE command to display
           the volume identity  before  you  issue  the  IDENTIFY
           command.   For  more  information,  see  the RECOGNIZE
           command description.



   Example

        A user requests that you mount an unlabeled tape.  After the tape
        mount  request  appears,  you mount and prepare the tape and then
        identify the tape to the mount request.

   2.19  LOCK   2.19  LOCK




   Function

        The LOCK command prohibits  users  from  accessing  a  disk  file
        structure so that you can remove the structure from the system.

        If a timesharing job is  accessing  the  structure,  the  job  is
        refused  access  after  its  current program has completed.  If a
        batch job is accessing the  structure,  the  LOCK  command  takes
        effect after the batch job is completed.

        When the LOCK command takes effect,  the  structure  is  unloaded
        from the disk drive.

        of the LOCK command.

                           that  is  currently  known to the system.  The
                           structure must be mounted  and  on-line.   The
                           name must end with a colon(:).

        date-and-time      specifies an optional date and time  when  the
                           structure  will be LOCKed so that users cannot
                           access it.  The  date  is  in  the  format  of
                           "mm-dd-yy,"  where  mm is the month, dd is the
                           day, and yy is the year, separated by hyphens.
                           The time is in the format of "hh:mm," where hh
                           is the hour and mm is the  minutes,  separated
                           by  a colon.  The time is based on the 24-hour
                           clock.

                           disk pack.  If this switch is  not  specified,
                           the  structure  is  unloaded  (stops spinning)
                           from the disk drive.


   Restrictions

        If you specify a structure name not known to the system, you  get
        the following error message:

             ? No such device

        If you specify a structure name that is currently LOCKed, you get
        the following message:

             hh:mm:ss        --- Structure name: already LOCKed ---

        If you specify an optional date without a time, the time defaults
        to 00:00:00 (or the start of that date).

        If you specify an optional time without a date, the date defaults
        to  the  current  date.  If the time has already occurred for the
        current date, the time applies to the next day.


   Examples

        1.  Use the LOCK command to restrict all users from accessing the
            structure SYS1: so that you can refresh it.

   2.20  MODIFY   2.20  MODIFY




   Function

        The MODIFY command allows you to change either of the following:

         o  The priority  of  a  job  request  waiting  in  a  queue  for
            processing

         o  The disk unit or structure name in one of the system lists.

        When you modify the priority of a job  request,  you  change  the
        importance  of  that job request in relationship to other jobs in
        the queues waiting to be processed.

        When a user submits a job request for  processing,  its  priority
        number  defaults to a value that is set at GALGEN time.  The user
        who requests  the  job  can  set  the  priority  value  with  the
        /PRIORITY:   switch.   However, the MODIFY command permits you to
        override the priority value for any job request.

        When you change a system list, you remove or add a disk-unit name
        (or  structure)  to  either  the active-swapping list, crash-dump
        list, or system-search list.

                                      NOTE

                Consult your  system  manager  before  using  the
                MODIFY  command to change system lists.  Removing
                or adding a structure or disk unit to any of  the
                lists  can greatly affect the performance of your
                system.

        The system lists are determined by the disk HOME blocks when  the
        monitor  is  brought  up.  To check the current system lists, use
        the SHOW SYSTEM command.

   Arguments

        request-id-number  modifies a single request  from  a  particular
                           user, as specified by the appropriate keyword.

        [PPN]              modifies  all  jobs  as   specified   by   the

                           identifies the user.

        *                  modifies  all  requests  from  all  users   as
                           specified by the keyword.

        PRIORITY nn        modifies the priority  number  (nn)  that  the
                           request(s)  will be set to.  The number can be
                           in the range from 1 to  63.   The  higher  the
                           number  is,  the greater the importance of the

                           list.  The disk unit name can be from 1  to  4
                           alphanumeric characters in length, followed by
                           a colon.

        structure:         specifies the name of the file structure to be
                           excluded  or included in either the crash-dump
                           list or the system-search list.  The structure

                           characters in length,  followed  by  a  colon.
                           The  structure  must be mounted before you use
                           the MODIFY command.

   Restriction

        You cannot MODIFY the priority of a job request once it has begun
        to process in a batch stream or on an output device.

        If you attempt to exclude or include a disk unit  (or  structure)
        name  that  has  not  been  recognized by the system, you get the
        following error message:

             ? Unknown device: "device"

        If you specify  a  disk  unit  (or  structure)  that  is  already
        included in the system list, you get the following error message:

             hh:mm:ss     Device "str" -- Is already in "system" list --

        the name of the system list.

   Examples

        1.  Modify a printer request so that its priority will be greater
            than  the next request to be printed.  Thus, if print request
            13 was the next print request and you modify print request 15
            to be 50, print request 15 prints before print request 13.

   Function

        The MOUNT command mounts a structure and assigns it an alias name
        when structure and/or volume recognition is disabled.

        When both structure and volume recognition  are  disabled,  first
        mount  and prepare the structure.  Then use the RECOGNIZE command
        to force MDA to  read  the  HOME  blocks  of  the  structure  and
        recognize  the volume mounted.  Finally, use the MOUNT command so
        that the system acknowledges the structure as mounted.

   Keyword

        STRUCTURE          specifies a file structure.  You must  include
                           the keyword STRUCTURE in the MOUNT command.

   Arguments

        structure-name:    specifies the logical  identification  of  the
                           file  structure  you  have  mounted  and  made
                           ready.  The structure name can be from 1 to  4
                           alphanumeric  characters  in  length  followed
                           with  a  colon.   An  example  of  a   logical
                           structure name is DSKA:.

        alias-name:        specifies a 1-to 4-alphanumeric character name
                           when two file structures are of the same name.
                           For example, if two file structures  exist  as
                           DSKA:,  the  second  structure  could  have an
                           alias of ADSK:.

        The NEXT command allows you to specify the request that  will  be
        serviced  next in an input queue.  When you use the NEXT command,
        the request that  you  specified  starts  immediately  after  the
        current request is finished.

                            the job.

   Switch

        /NODE:identifier    specifies the name of a node in the  network.
                            It  identifies  a  remote  node for which the
                            command should be effective.  For example, to
                            specify    the   node   named   KL1026,   use
                            /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not specify  a  node
                            identifier, your own node is the default.

   Example

        A user (MORRILL) requests that his print job be moved to the  top
        of  the  print  queue  to be printed when a printer is available.
        You   must   examine   the   print   queue    to    obtain    the
        request-identification  number  for  his print request.  Then you
        use the NEXT command to place his request next in the queue.

   Function

        The PUSH command enables  you  to  enter  monitor  command  level
        without  exiting  the  OPR program.  For example, you may want to
        use PUSH  so  that  you  can  enter  operator-privileged  monitor
        commands.  To return to OPR, use the monitor command POP.

        For more information about PUSH and POP, see the CONTEXT  command

   2.24  RECOGNIZE   2.24  RECOGNIZE




   Function

        The RECOGNIZE command forces the system to read the volume labels
        of  a  tape  or  structure.   This command need only be used when
        hardware restrictions limit the use of  volume  recognition.   In
        addition, this command is useful in the following situations:

         o  When a labeled tape has been mounted on a tape drive after an
            unassigned  labeled  tape  has  been unloaded by pressing the
            UNLOAD button on the tape drive (TU70, 71, 72, 73 only).

         o  When a tape is mounted on a drive  which  does  not  generate
            on-line interrupts (for example, TU40).

         o  When VOLUME-RECOGNITION has been disabled for the tape  drive
            or disk drive.

                           number.


   Restriction

        If the tape drive is unavailable, you  must  first  use  the  SET
        TAPE-DRIVE AVAILABLE command, and then the RECOGNIZE command.

                                 RECOGNIZE


        If the tape  volume  is  unlabeled  and  you  use  the  RECOGNIZE
        command, the following message appears:

        hh:mm:ss        Device MTAn  -- Unlabeled Volume Mounted --

        You must then  use  the  IDENTIFY  command  to  have  the  system
        recognize  the  unlabeled  tape volume to a particular tape mount
        request.   See  the  IDENTIFY  command   description   for   more
        information.

        Do not press the UNLOAD button on TU70 tape drives to unload  and
        remove a tape.  Always use either the monitor command DISMOUNT or
        the OPR command DISMOUNT to unload a tape from a TU70 tape drive.


   Examples

        1.  You have volume recognition disabled on tape drive 1  (MTA1:)
            and  you mount a labeled tape on MTA1:  in response to a user
            MOUNT request.  After the tape has been brought to a  "ready"
            state,  you must use the RECOGNIZE command to have the system
            recognize the labeled tape on the tape drive.

   Function

        The REQUEUE command stops a job request that is in progress, puts
        the  job request back in the queue in the HOLD state, and cancels
        the in-progress job request.  To  reschedule  the  job,  use  the
        RELEASE command.

        BATCH-STREAM       requeues a particular batch stream that has  a
                           job currently active within it.

        CARD-PUNCH         requeues a particular card-punch  that  has  a

   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  the  remote node for which the
                           command is effective.  For example, to specify
                           the  node  named KL1026, use /NODE:KL1026.  If
                           you do not specify a node identifier, your own
                           node is the default.

        /REASON:comment    allows you to include a comment explaining why
                           the  job  has  been  requeued.   This  comment
                           appears in the  batch  log  file  and  at  the

   Arguments

        BEGINNING-OF       specifies  that  requeuing   starts   at   the
                           beginning  of  the  COPY,  FILE, or JOB.  This
                           argument is  valid  when  you  requeue  a  job
                           currently  processing on a device, such as the
                           line printer.  This argument is  invalid  with
                           the BATCH-STREAM keyword.

             COPY          specifies  that  requeuing   starts   at   the
                           beginning of the current copy being processed.
                           (Refer  to  the  BACKSPACE  and   FORWARDSPACE
                           commands.)

             FILE          specifies  that  requeuing   starts   at   the
                           beginning of the current file being processed.
                           (Refer  to  the  BACKSPACE  and   FORWARDSPACE
                           commands.)

             JOB           specifies  that  requeuing   starts   at   the
                           beginning  of the current job being processed.
                           With JOB, the entire job is requeued.

        CURRENT-POSITION   specifies the current position  (line  number)
                           of  the  job on unit number nn at the time you
                           issue the REQUEUE command.

   Function

        The RESPOND command allows you to reply to any  message  sent  to
        you  by  means  of  WTOR (Write-To-Operator with Response) from a
        user or from a batch job.

        When a user or software task sends you a message that requires  a
        response,  OPR  assigns the message a number so that you can keep
        track of all messages sent to operations.  Use the SHOW  MESSAGES
        command, to display outstanding messages.

        You must specify a message number with the RESPOND command.

        text               specifies a single- or multiple-line response.
                           If you press carriage return immediately after
                           the message number, OPR  responds  with  ENTER
                           TEXT  AND  TERMINATE  WITH  ^Z.   You can then
                           enter as many lines of text as needed.  To end

        The RESTRICT command limits the use of a specified device to  the

   2.30  ROUTE   2.30  ROUTE




   Function

        The ROUTE command changes the destination of output requests,  so
        that  the  output  intended  for  a  specific unit(s) (the source
        unit[s]) will automatically be output  on  another  unit(s)  (the
        destination unit[s]).  The source and destination units may be on
        the same node, or they may be on different nodes.

        This function is useful when a unit malfunctions and  the  output
        from that device is necessary immediately.

        If you are an operator at a central site, you  can  route  output
        from  one  unit  to  another,  on  the  same  or  any other node.
        However, output cannot be processed on another host  system.   If
        you  route  output to another host node, the request(s) remain in
        the queue indefinitely because the request cannot  be  processed.
        If  you  are an operator at a remote node, you can route requests
        from one unit to another on your node.

        All device routing is entered into the system route  table.   You
        can   examine   the  route  table  with  the  OPR  command,  SHOW
        ROUTE-TABLE.

        To end routing and delete the entry from the system route  table,
        use  the ROUTE command and omit the information pertaining to the
        destination unit(s) and node.

        Because the format and arguments  used  with  the  ROUTE  command
        depend  largely  on the keyword you use, it is highly recommended
        that you use the  recognition  feature  (<ESC>)  until  you  feel
        comfortable with the command format.

                           destination-information, any existing  entries

        source-information

                           specifies the unit and  node  from  which  the
                           output  will  be  routed.   The unit number is
                           specified as either n (for a specific unit) or
                           ALL-UNITS,  to  designate  that all output for
                           the appropriate device is to be routed.   Note
                           that  if  you  specify a unit number, only the
                           requests made for that specific unit (with the
                           /UNIT  switch)  will  be  routed.  The node is
                           specified by the switch /NODE:name  (described
                           below).   If  you omit the node specification,
                           the  node  to  which  you  are  connected   is
                           assumed.

        destination-information

                           specifies the  unit  and  node  to  which  the
                           output  will be routed.  The unit is specified
                           by n, the unit number, or ALL-UNITS.  The node
                           is  specified  by the switch /NODE:name, which
                           is described below.  If  you  omit  the  /NODE
                           switch, the node to which you are connected is
                           assumed.


   Switch

        /NODE:name         specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.


   Restrictions

        You cannot route output from ALL-UNITS to a specific unit number.
        If you type this command, the following error occurs:

        OPR>ROUTE PRINTER ALL-UNITS/NODE:KL1026 0/NODE:DN200<RET>
        OPR>
        15:15:36        -- Cannot Route a Generic Unit --
        OPR>

        This error is produced to prevent output from being processed  on
        a unit that does not have certain necessary characteristics.  For
        example,  if  printer  0  at  DN200  does  not   have   lowercase
        capability,  and  if  the requests being routed require a printer
        with lowercase capability, then the requests cannot be  processed
        on printer 0 at DN200.


   Examples

        1.  To route the output that is destined for printer  unit  0  to
            printer unit 1, on the same node, use the following command:

                _____ _______ _ ______            OPR>ROUTE PRINTER 0 1<RET>

        2.  To end the routing for printer 0 and to delete the entry from
            the routing table, use the following command:

        3.  To route all the output that is going to node DN200  to  node
            KL1026, use the following command:

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies a batch-stream number.   The  number
                           is  usually  from 0 to 5, but can be larger if
                           your  installation   uses   additional   batch
                           streams.

        n:m                specifies a range of batch streams.  You  must
                           include  a  stream  number  or range of stream
                           numbers with the SET BATCH-STREAM command.

        ATTRIBUTE          specifies whether the  batch  stream  operates
                           with the BATCON or the SITGO program.

             BATCON        specifies that the batch stream is to use  the
                           BATCON   controller.    (This  is  the  system
                           default batch controller.)

             SITGO         specifies the  SITGO  batch  processor,  which
                           consists   of  a  fast  FORTRAN  compiler  for
                           compiling FORTRAN programs in a batch stream.

        MEMORY-LIMITS nn   
                      n:m
                           specifies the maximum number of  memory  pages
                           allowed for a batch stream or a range of batch
                           streams.  If you specify  a  range  with  this
                           keyword, the range is from a minimum number of
                           memory pages to a  maximum  number  of  memory
                           pages.

        NOOPR-INTERVENTION 
                           specifies that a user cannot make any requests
                           in  the  batch job that require you to perform
                           an action of some kind or require you to  send
                           a    message.     If    a    batch   job   has
                           NOOPR-INTERVENTION set, any messages it  sends
                           are  ignored, and you are not asked to perform
                           any action.

                           For  example,  If  the  batch   job   requests
                           mountable  devices,  and  if the job must wait
                           until the device is mounted, an error  message
                           results.

        OPR-INTERVENTION   specifies that the user can pass  messages  to
                           you  and  that  you  are  available to perform
                           actions that a user or batch job requests.

        PRIORITY-LIMITS nn
                        n:m

                           stream  or  a  range  of  batch streams at the
                           central site or at a node.  The numeric  value
                           associated  with this argument means that only
                           batch  jobs  submitted  by  users   with   the
                           /PRIORITY:   switch  specifying the number (or
                           range)  you  set  for  the  batch  stream  can
                           execute in that stream.  The numeric value for
                           the PRIORITY-LIMITS argument can be from 1  to
                           63.   The  higher  the  number, the higher the

        SYSTEM-OPR-INTERVENTION

                           a  given  batch  stream  or  a  range of batch
                           streams.  When a  batch  job  enters  a  batch
                           stream,  it receives a default execution time,
                           such as five minutes.  If the job exceeds this
                           time  limit, and if the user who submitted the
                           batch job set up his control  file  to  handle
                           time limits, the batch system gives the job an
                           additional 10% of the allocated time.  If  the
                           job  exceeds  this  additional 10%, the job is
                           canceled.  The TIME-LIMITS argument allows you
                           to specify that batch jobs that are set to run
                           a certain length  of  time  will  run  in  the
                           specified batch-stream number (or range).  The
                           numeric value for the TIME-LIMITS argument can
                           be from 0 to 99999, representing minutes.

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

   Function

        The SET CARD-PUNCH command enables you to  specify  the  kind  of
        jobs  to  schedule  on  this  device.  You can set the form type,
        output limits (maximum number of cards), priority limits, and the
        action  to  be taken when a job exceeds the output limit that the
        user specifies.  This command allows you to change the parameters
        that  are set at GALGEN time.  You must supply a unit number or a
        range of unit numbers with this command.

        The card-punch device handles standard 12-row, 80-column cards.

        The defaults for the card punch are set by your system manager at
        software-installation   time   through   the  generation  of  the
        SYS:SPFORM.INI file.

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies  a  card-punch  unit  number.    The
                           number  is  usually  from  0  to 5, but can be
                           larger  if   your   installation   uses   more
                           card-punch devices.

        n:m                specifies a range of card-punch unit numbers.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the type of  card-punch  forms.   By
                           setting the FORMS-TYPE, you are specifying the
                           type of forms in the card punch.

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken
                           if a card-punch job that is currently punching
                           exceeds the set limit of output.   (The  limit
                           is  set  by  the  user with /LIMIT.) There are
                           three possible  actions  associated  with  the
                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you be asked what to do if  the
                           card-punch  job  exceeds  the  card  limit  on
                           output.  You then have the option to  continue
                           or  abort  the  card-punch  job.   This is the
                           default.

             ABORT         specifies   that   the   card-punch   job   is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             PROCEED       specifies that the  card-punch  job  continues
                           automatically and the limit is ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMITS cards

                           specifies the maximum card limit  for  punched
                           output.   This  argument  can  also  specify a
                           range of card limits.  The card  limit  refers
                           to   the  number  of  output  cards  that  are
                           punched.  This command restricts the  size  of
                           jobs  that  can  start  on  the card punch you
                           specify.

        PRIORITY-LIMITS nn

                           specifies   the   priority   limits   (numeric
                           importance) of a card punch or a range of card
                           punches at the central site or at a node.  The
                           numeric  value  associated  with this argument
                           means that only card-punch jobs  submitted  by
                           users  with  the /PRIORITY switch specifying a
                           number in the range you set for the card punch
                           can  execute  on that card punch.  The numeric
                           value for the PRIORITY-LIMITS argument can  be
                           from  1  to  63.   The  higher the number, the
                           higher the priority.

   Restriction

        To set a KSYS time that is less than one hour  from  the  current
        time,  you  must  specify  the  time  in  hours and minutes.  For
        example, to SET KSYS for five minutes from the current time,  you
        must use the form:

             SET KSYS +0:05

        SET KSYS +5 sets the KSYS time for 5 hours from the current time.


   Example

        Set the KSYS time to midnight for 21-Nov-84.

   2.38  SET NODE   2.38  SET NODE




   Function

        The SET NODE command applies only if your  installation  has  IBM
        Communications software.

        The SET NODE command allows you to specify the modem-related  and
        data-transfer-related  parameters  for  IBM  Communications nodes
        that perform IBM communications.  Before you set  the  parameters
        for  a  node,  you must define the node name, type, and mode with
        the DEFINE command.


   Format

        OPR>SET NODE keyword arguments<RET>

        where keyword

             specifies the node  name  of  the  remote  station  for  IBM
             communications.    The   name   can   be  from  one  to  six
             alphanumeric characters long.


   Arguments

        BYTES-PER-MESSAGE b

                  specifies the number of bytes per message, b, that  the
                  front end uses to communicate with the remote site.

        CLEAR-SEND-DELAY d

                  specifies  a  clear-to-send  delay,  where  d   is   an
                  arbitrary  number of clock ticks used by the front end.
                  This value is not an element of a discrete set.  It can
                  be any positive integer value.

        RECORDS-PER-MESSAGE r

                  specifies the number of records per  message,  where  r
                  can equal any positive integer.  The defaults of r are:

                  0 for unlimited number of records (the default for HASP
                    and 3780)

                  2 for a 2780 unit with no multirecord feature

                  7 for a unit like an  IBM  2780  with  the  multirecord
                    feature (the default for 2780)

        TIMEOUT-CATEGORY P/S

                  specifies the timeout category where you specify either
                  P   or  S.   P  represents  PRIMARY  and  S  represents
                  SECONDARY.   Timeout  category  is  used  by  the   BSC
                  protocol  to  determine  how connecting systems bid for
                  use of the line.  Two systems bidding for the use of  a
                  line  may  not  be  in the same timeout category, since
                  this condition can result in simultaneous  bids  for  a
                  line,  which  causes  a deadlock.  To prevent this, one
                  system is placed in the PRIMARY (P)  category  and  the
                  other  in  the  SECONDARY (S) category.  For emulation,
                  the  timeout  category  is  normally  SECONDARY.    For
                  termination, the timeout category is normally PRIMARY.

        TRANSPARENCY ON/OFF

                  specifies a transmission mode where the recognition  of
                  most  control  characters  is  suppressed (TRANSPARENCY
                  ON).  The argument can be  specified  only  when  using
                  HASP.  The default TRANSPARENCY is OFF.


   Example

        Specify the SET NODE command to set the clear-to-send delay of  3
        for node IBM1.

   Argument

        OUTPUT-STREAM      specifies  that  the  given  NQC  stream  will
                           transmit output jobs to remote nodes.  This is
                           the default.


   Switch

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

   Function

        The SET PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH command specifies the kind of jobs to be
        scheduled  on  this  device.   You can set the forms type, output
        limits (in number of feet of paper tape),  priority  limits,  and
        the action to be taken when a job exceeds its output limit.  This
        command allows you to change  the  parameters  that  are  set  at
        GALGEN  time.  You must specify a specific unit number or a range
        of unit numbers.

        The defaults for the paper-tape punch  are  set  by  your  system
        manager  at  software-installation time through the generation of
        the SYS:SPFORM.INI file.  These defaults are usually referred  to

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies a paper-tape-punch unit number.  The
                           number  is  usually  from  0  to 5, but can be
                           larger   if   your   installation   has   more
                           paper-tape-punch devices.

        n:m                specifies a range of paper-tape punches.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name of the type  of  paper-tape

                           exceeds its limit of output.   (The  limit  is
                           set by the user with the /LIMIT switch.) There
                           are three possible actions associated with the
                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you be asked what to do if  the
                           paper-tape  job  exceeds  the  fold  limit  on
                           output.  You then have the option to  continue
                           or abort the paper-tape job.

             ABORT         specifies   that   the   paper-tape   job   be
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             PROCEED       specifies that  the  paper-tape  job  continue
                           automatically and the output limit be ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMITS feet

                           specifies  the  maximum  number  of  feet   of
                           punched  paper-tape  output  for  jobs  on the
                           specified  paper  tape  punch  device.    This
                           command  restricts  the  size of jobs that are
                           sent to the specified paper-tape punch.

        PRIORITY-LIMITS nn

                           specifies   the   priority   limits   (numeric
                           importance)  of  a paper-tape punch or a range
                           of paper-tape punches at the central  site  or
                           at  a node.  The numeric value associated with
                           this argument means that only paper-tape  jobs
                           submitted  by  users with the /PRIORITY switch
                           specifying a number within the range  you  set

                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

   Function

        The SET  PLOTTER  command  specifies  the  kind  of  jobs  to  be
        scheduled  on  this  device.   You can set the forms type, output
        limits (step limits), priority limits, and the action to be taken
        when  a job exceeds its output limit.  This command allows you to
        change the parameters that are set  at  GALGEN  time.   You  must
        specify a unit number or a range of unit numbers.

        The   plotter   device   draws   (or   plots)   ink   plots    of
        computer-generated data.  Its movement in producing the output is
        measured in "steps." The steps refer to the speed per  second  of
        the  plotter  and the distance (or size) that the pencils move on
        the output paper.  The paper for the plotter is  either  drum-fed
        or bed-fed.

        The defaults for plotter output are set by your system manager at
        software-installation   time   through   the  generation  of  the
        SYS:SPFORM.INI file.  At some installations, the default  setting
        for the plotter form type is referred to as NORMAL.

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies a plotter unit number.   The  number
                           is  usually  from 0 to 5, but can be larger if
                           your installation has more plotter devices.

        n:m                specifies a range of plotter unit numbers.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name  of  the  type  of  plotter
                           forms.   Typically,  the  normal plotter paper
                           form is roll-fed or bed-fed,  but  it  can  be
                           referred  to as type ROLL, DRUM, or BED.  Your
                           installation can have different form names for
                           different plotter types.

                           the unit number you specify exceeds the output
                           limit.  (The limit is set by the user with the
                           /LIMIT switch.) There are three possible words

                           plotter  job  exceeds  the  output limit.  You
                           then have the option to continue or abort  the
                           plotter job.

             ABORT         specifies   that   the    plotter    job    be
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             PROCEED       specifies  that  the  plotter   job   continue
                           automatically  and  the specified output limit
                           be ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMIT minutes

                           specifies  the  maximum  number   of   plotter

                           plotters at the central site  or  at  a  node.
                           The   numeric   value   associated  with  this
                           argument  means   that   only   plotter   jobs

                           specifying the number within the range you set
                           for the plotter can be output on that plotter.
                           The  numeric  value  for  the  PRIORITY-LIMITS
                           argument  can be from 1 to 63.  The higher the

   Function

        The SET  PRINTER  command  specifies  the  kind  of  jobs  to  be
        scheduled  on  this  device.   You  can  set the forms type, page
        limits, priority limits, and the action to be taken  when  a  job
        exceeds  its  limit.   This  command  allows  you  to  change the
        parameters that are set at  GALGEN  time.   You  must  specify  a
        specific  unit  number  or a range of unit numbers.  In addition,
        you can specify ranges for the page and priority limits.

        The defaults for the line printers at your installation  are  set
        by  your system manager at software-installation time through the
        generation of the SYS:n-CONFIG.CMD file (where n is  the  TOPS-10
        software  generation  number)  and  the  <SYSTEM>LPFORM.INI file.
        These  defaults  are  usually  referred  to  as  NORMAL  in  most

                           the printer is referred to  as  1-ply-wide  or
                           1-ply-narrow.   These can be abbreviated as 1W
                           or 1N, or can be given some other name by your
                           system  manager.   Your  installation can have
                           different  names  for   different   types   of

                           the unit number you specify exceeds the  limit
                           of  output.  The limit is set by the user with
                           /LIMIT.   There  are  three  possible  actions
                           associated   with   the  LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION
                           argument.  They are:

                           do  if  the printer job exceeds the page limit
                           on  output.   You  then  have  the  option  to
                           continue or abort the printer job.

             ABORT         specifies that the print job be  automatically
                           canceled when the limit has been exceeded.

             PROCEED       specifies  that   the   print   job   continue

                           characteristics.  The command does not  affect
                           a  printer that is started, but the command is
                           remembered, and if the printer is SHUTDOWN and
                           restarted,  the  new value takes effect.  This
                           is the default for ANF printers.

        MAGTAPE            enables the print spooler to write  non-system

        NO LP20-SIMULATION disables LP20 Print Controller simulation.

        PAGE-LIMITS pages  specifies the maximum page limit  for  printed
                           output.   This  argument  can  also  specify a
                           range of page limits.  The page  limit  refers
                           to   the  number  of  output  pages  that  are
                           printed.  This command restricts the  size  of
                           jobs that are sent to the printer you specify.

        /TRACKS: (7, 9, or DEFAULT)

                           sets the number of tracks for a magtape volume
                           set  to 7, 9, or DEFAULT.  If the tape density
                           you specify is 1600 or 6250 BPI, then 9 is the
                           default  number  of  tracks.  You must specify
                           the number of tracks when you specify  any  of
                           these tape densities:  200, 556, or 800 BPI.

        /VOLUME-SET:string

                           specifies the name of the cataloged volume-set
                           ("string").


   Examples

        1.  Use the SET PRINTER command  to  set  the  default  printer's
            forms  type  to  1-ply-wide  for  all  line  printers at your
            installation.  NORMAL has  been  previously  defined  in  the

   Function

        The SET TAPE-DRIVE command sets the availability  characteristics
        of  a  particular  tape-drive device.  The SET TAPE-DRIVE command
        allows you to do the following:

         o  Allow users to request that tapes be mounted

         o  Disallow users' requests to mount tapes

         o  Initialize tapes

        You must specify the logical tape-drive  name,  and  one  of  the
        keywords:  AVAILABLE, INITIALIZE, or UNAVAILABLE.

                           tape-drive number.  You must include the colon
                           at  the  end  of  the  name.   An example of a

                           Tape Drive 0.


   Arguments

        AVAILABLE          makes the specified tape drive  available  for
                           user   tape  mount  requests.   This  argument
                           cancels  the   effect   of   the   UNAVAILABLE
                           argument.   The  tape  drive remains AVAILABLE

        INITIALIZE         makes the specified tape drive unavailable for
                           user  mount requests so that you can use it to
                           initialize   tapes.    A   labeled   tape   is
                           initialized    when   you   write   a   volume
                           identification at the beginning of the tape in
                           the  standard  ANSI format.  An unlabeled tape
                           is  initialized  when  you  write   a   record
                           containing 80 null characters at the beginning
                           of  the  tape.   When  the  tapes  have   been
                           INITIALIZEd,   the  tape  drive  automatically
                           becomes available  for  user  mount  requests.
                           You   specify   the  number  of  tapes  to  be
                           initialized with the /COUNT switch.

        UNAVAILABLE        makes the specified tape drive unavailable  to
                           user   tape-mount   requests.   This  argument
                           cancels the effect of the AVAILABLE  argument.
                           If  a  user  is currently using a tape on this
                           tape drive, the tape drive becomes unavailable
                           after  the  user  completes  his work.  If the
                           system crashes or is shut  down,  the  command
                           SET  TAPE-DRIVE  MTAn:  UNAVAILABLE remains in
                           effect after the system is in operation again.

                                                NOTE

                               Drives that are set UNAVAILABLE can be
                               ASSIGNed  by  user  jobs.   This could
                               pose a security problem, as  no  label
                               processing    or    verification    is
                               performed  by   the   system   on   an
                               UNAVAILABLE drive.

                           When you specify UNAVAILABLE, you can enter  a
                           single-  or multiple-line reason and terminate
                           it  with  a  carriage  return;  or   you   can

                           return after the UNAVAILABLE keyword  and  OPR

        /COUNT:nn          specifies the  number  (nn)  of  tapes  to  be

                           unloaded and the tape drive is ready to accept
                           the next tape to  initialize.   When  as  many
                           tapes  as  specified by the /COUNT switch have
                           been initialized, the tape  drive  returns  to
                           the AVAILABLE (off-line) state.

                           If you use this switch, the volid you  specify
                           in  the  /VOLUME-ID  switch must have trailing
                           numerics which will allow  the  numeric  value
                           specified by the /INCREMENT switch to be added
                           after each tape is initialized.

        /DENSITY:nn        specifies the BPI (bits-per-inch)  density  of
                           the  tapes to be initialized.  The number (nn)
                           can be 200, 556, 800, 1600, or 6250.   If  you
                           do   not  specify  the  /DENSITY  switch,  the
                           density defaults to 1600 BPI.

        /INCREMENT:nn      specifies the numeric value (nn) by  which  to
                           increment  the  tape volumes .  This switch is
                           valid only when specified with the  /VOLUME-ID
                           switch.   If  you  do not include this switch,
                           the default increment value is 1.   (Refer  to
                           /COUNT.)

        /LABEL-TYPE:type   specifies the type of label to be  written  on
                           the  tape.   The  type can be ANSI, EBCDIC, or
                           UNLABELED.  If  you  specify  any  label  type
                           other  than  unlabeled,  you  must include the
                           /VOLUME-ID switch.

        /OVERRIDE-EXPIRATION: (YES or NO)

                           specifies whether to check for the  expiration
                           date  of the data on the tape.  If you specify
                           NO and attempt to reinitialize a labeled  tape
                           whose  first  file  is not expired, the system
                           issues  an  error   message   and   does   not
                           reinitialize  the  tape.   If you specify YES,
                           each tape  is  reinitialized  unconditionally.
                           If  you  are initializing brand new tapes, you
                           should specify YES to prevent the  tape  drive
                           from  "running away" when PULSAR tries to read
                           a label from the tape.

                           The default for this switch is YES.

        /OWNER:[PPN]

                           specifies the project-programmer number of the
                           owner  of  the  tapes to be initialized.  This
                           switch affects only ANSI  and  EBCDIC  labeled
                           tapes.   If  you  do  not  specify  the /OWNER
                           switch, the  tape  is  initialized  for  owner
                           [0,0].

        /PROTECTION:nnn    specifies  a  3-digit  octal  number  as   the
                           protection  number of the tape.  The number is
                           usually from 000 (where  anyone  can  use  the
                           tape)  through  777  (where no one can use the
                           tape).  If you do not specify the  /PROTECTION
                           switch, the default is 000.

        /TAPE-DISPOSITION:condition

                           specifies what is to be done to the tape after
                           it  is  initialized.   The  condition  can  be
                           either HOLD or UNLOAD.  If you  specify  HOLD,
                           the  tape  is initialized and is not unloaded.
                           A user requesting the tape can use it  without
                           your  having  to  reload  it.   If you specify
                           UNLOAD,  the  tape  is  initialized   and   is
                           unloaded  from the tape drive.  The default is
                           UNLOAD.   If  a  value  greater  than   1   is
                           specified    by   the   /COUNT   switch,   the
                           /TAPE-DISPOSITION switch applies to  the  last
                           tape initialized.

        /VOLUME-ID:"volid" specifies  a  volume  identification  for  the
                           tape.    The   volid  must  be  from  1  to  6
                           characters.  If the volid is  to  contain  any
                           nonalphanumeric  characters, the volid must be
                           enclosed in double quotes (").  This switch is
                           not necessary if the tape is being initialized
                           as an unlabeled tape.


   Restriction

        If you set a tape drive to be UNAVAILABLE before you set the tape
        drive to INITIALIZE, the following error message appears:

        hh:mm:ss        Device MTxn  -- Illegal For UNAVAILABLE Device --

                                     CAUTION

                Setting a tape drive unavailable  can  produce  a
                system  deadlock  if insufficient resources exist
                to satisfy outstanding  disk  and  tape  resource
                requests.


        The SET TAPE-DRIVE command to INITIALIZE must be given for a tape
        drive  that  is  AVAILABLE.  When the initialization is complete,
        the tape drive is left in an AVAILABLE (off-line) state.


        Examples

        1.  A user (JONES.J) has  requested  a  tape  mount  of  an  ANSI
            labeled  tape  with  a volid of FOOBAR and has requested that
            you initialize the tape first.   The  volume  is  initialized
            with ANSI labels and a volid of FOOBAR.  (The system defaults
            to density [1600 BPI] and protection [000].) When the tape is
            mounted  on  the  drive,  the  tape  is  initialized and then
            becomes  available  to  the  user   (/TAPE-DISPOSITION:HOLD).
            Volume recognition takes over and satisfies the mount request
            for FOOBAR.

        TYPE and the model name or number.

        In addition, you  can  set  your  terminal  to  have  OPR  keypad
        functions.   Keypad functions allow you to give an OPR command by
        pressing one of the PF keys to the right of the keyboard on  VT52

   Function

        The SET USAGE command allows you to control the usage  accounting
        system  during  system  operation.   Consult  your system manager
        before you use the SET USAGE command.  Your installation may have
        specific   usage   accounting   requirements  for  billing  users
        accessing the system.

        Normally, the SYS:SYSTEM.CMD file contains the SET USAGE command.
        Your  system  manager  may have set up an accounting billing rate
        for prime time users (for example, from 08:00 to 18:00)  and  for
        off-prime  time  users (for example, from 19:00 to 07:00).  There
        may also be another accounting billing rate for weekend users.

        The usage accounting file, ACT:USAGE.OUT, can be used to  collect
        accounting information such as CPU time, spooled output requests,
        and disk space used.  Depending on the method you use, accounting
        data  is  collected and/or written to the ACT:USAGE.OUT file when
        you give the SET USAGE command.

                           16:00 and  19:00,  and  you  set  the  billing
                           closure  at  18:00 to collect prime time usage
                           between 16:00 and 18:00.

        FILE-CLOSURE       specifies  that  the  current  usage  file  be
                           closed  and renamed, and that a new usage file
                           (USAGE.OUT) be opened.  The old usage file  is
                           renamed in the format of yymmdd.hhx, where:

                           yy    is the year.

                           mm    is the month.

                           dd    is the day.

   Arguments

        hh:mm              specifies the time  (24-hour  clock  time)  in
                           hours  (hh)  and  minutes  (mm) separated by a
                           colon.

        DAILY hh:mm        specifies file closure on a daily basis  at  a

                           (mm).

        EVERY day hh:mm    specifies file closure on a particular day  at
                           a  particular  time  in hours (hh) and minutes
                           (mm).   The  day  parameter  for   the   EVERY
                           argument   can  be  SUNDAY,  MONDAY,  TUESDAY,
                           WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, or SATURDAY.

        NOW                specifies file closure to occur immediately.

        mm-dd-yy hh:mm     specifies  a  date  and  time  when  the  file
                           closure will occur.  The date is in the format
                           of "mm-dd-yy," where mm is the  month,  dd  is
                           the  day,  and  yy  is  the  year separated by
                           hyphens.  (You can optionally specify the date
                           in  the format of "dd-xxx-yy," where xxx is an
                           abbreviated month name.) The time  is  in  the
                           format of "hh:mm," where hh is the hour and mm
                           is the minutes separated by a colon.  The time
                           applies to a 24-hour clock.

   2.48  SHOW ALLOCATION   2.48  SHOW ALLOCATION




   Function

        The  SHOW  ALLOCATION  command  displays  allocations   for   all
        mountable  devices  (disk  drives and tape drives).  This command
        displays the disk drive name, the structure name, and, for tapes,
        the  track  size  and  BPI density of the allocated resource.  It
        shows the number of devices allocated and the number  of  devices
        mounted.   You  can  display the mountable device allocations for
        all job requests, all batch  job  requests,  a  particular  batch
        request, or a particular job request.

        Use the SHOW ALLOCATION command when you need to know what  types
        of  disk or tape drives are allocated to a job that is waiting in
        the batch queue.  The job could be waiting because another  batch
        job  has  already  allocated  the  needed  resources.   Thus, the
        waiting batch job allocation requests can not  be  answered.   In
        addition,  this  command  is  useful  when  you need to know what
        mountable device allocations have been made by timesharing users.


   Format

        OPR>SHOW ALLOCATION argument<RET>


   Arguments

        ALL-REQUESTS       specifies  display  of  the  mountable  device
                           allocations  for  all  job requests (batch and
                           timesharing) that are currently  logged-in  or
                           waiting in the batch queue to be executed.

        BATCH-REQUEST nn   specifies display of the allocations  for  the
                           batch  request  with the identification number
                           nn.  If you do not specify the  batch  request
                           number   (nn),  all  batch  job  requests  are
                           displayed.

        JOB nn             specifies  display  of  the  mountable  device
                           allocation  for a particular job (either batch
                           or timesharing).  You  must  specify  the  job
                           number (nn) with this argument.

        This command enables you to display a particular stream while the
        job  is  processing, to see any possible problems that might come
        about due to an incorrect command, and to check whether there are

   Function

        The SHOW MESSAGES command displays any outstanding messages  that
        require  you  to  perform  an  action  or  reply with the RESPOND
        command.

        With the SHOW MESSAGES command, you can  specify  an  outstanding
        message number or a node.  If you do not specify either a message
        number or a node, OPR responds with all outstanding messages that
        you are enabled to receive.

        Use the RESPOND command to respond  to  any  outstanding  message
        displayed by this SHOW command.

        nnnn               specifies  the  outstanding  message   number.
                           Valid  message  numbers  can  range  from 0 to
                           9999.  If you do not specify a message number,
                           all  outstanding  messages with their sequence
                           numbers, if any, are displayed,  provided  you
                           have enabled the messages to appear at the OPR
                           terminal.


   Switch

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

                           If you do not specify the  /NODE  switch,  all
                           outstanding   messages   with  their  sequence
                           numbers, if any, are displayed, provided  that
                           the  messages are enabled to appear at the OPR
                           terminal.

   Restriction

        If you have disabled the output display  of  ALL-MESSAGES  and/or
        OPR-ACTION-MESSAGES, or if there are no outstanding messages, OPR
        responds with the message:

        hh:mm:ss        -- No Outstanding Messages --

        where hh:mm:ss is the time (in hours, minutes,  seconds)  of  the
        response.


   Examples

        1.  Use the SHOW MESSAGES  command  to  display  all  outstanding
            messages  with  their  sequence  numbers.  You are enabled to
            receive the output display of all messages.

   Function

        The SHOW OPERATORS command displays the terminal and job  numbers
        of  all  users  on  the  system who are running OPR.  The display
        shows the node, terminal number, job number, and user's name.

        In addition, you can specify the /NODE switch (network  software)
        to  display all users running OPR at a remote station.  If you do
        not specify the /NODE switch, all operators on  the  system  (all
        nodes included) are displayed.

   Switch

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node

   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   displays the given  queue  for  the  node  you
                           specify.   For example, /NODE:KL1026 specifies
                           the node named KL1026.  If you do not  specify
                           a  node  identifier,  your  own  node  is  the
                           default.

        /ALL               displays a full queue listing.  A full listing
                           includes   column  headers,  as  well  as  the
                           switches (for  example,  /HOLD),  and  default
                           parameters that apply to the jobs.

        /SHORT             displays  an  abbreviated  queue  listing.   A
                           short  listing  displays the job name, request
                           number, scheduled run time or expiration,  and
                           the  user  name  of  each job in the queue.  A
                           short listing does not display column headers,
                           switches, or default parameters.

        /USER:[PPN]        displays only jobs submitted by  a  particular
                           user.    The   user   is   identified  by  his

   2.56  SHOW STATUS   2.56  SHOW STATUS




   Function

        The  SHOW  STATUS  command  displays  the  current  status  of  a
        particular  device  or  range  of devices on the system.  You can
        display the status of batch or FAL streams,  input/output  units,
        tape-drives,  network  nodes, or all current devices known to the
        system.

        The SHOW STATUS command is useful  when  you  want  to  know  the
        current  status  of  the  system.   You can issue this command to
        check whether devices are active or idle.

        If you do not specify a keyword with the SHOW STATUS command, the
        command  defaults  to  batch  streams, printers, and readers.  In
        addition, if your  installation  has  a  card  punch,  paper-tape
        punch, or plotter, the SHOW STATUS command displays the status of
        these devices.

   DISK-DRIVE Switches

        /ALL               displays the status of both free  disk  drives
                           and  mounted  disk  drives.   This  switch  is
                           assumed if you do not specify a switch.

        /FREE              displays  only  those  disk  drives  that  are
                           available for structure mounts.

        /MOUNTED           displays  only  those  disk  drives  that  are
                           currently mounted and being accessed.

                           structure-name,  the  /USERS  switch lists all
                           users for all structures known to the system.


   TAPE-DRIVE Switches

        /ALL               displays all tape drives known to the  system.
                           The  status  display  also provides additional
                           information, such as the AVR status, the label
                           type,  and  the  density (BPI).  If you do not
                           specify  the  /ALL  switch,   the   additional
                           information  does  not  appear  in  the status
                           display.

        /FREE              displays all tape drives  that  are  currently
                           unloaded   and  available  for  mounting  tape
                           volumes.  The /FREE switch also displays those
                           tape drives that are loaded, but are not being
                           accessed by any user.

                           unit number.

        n:m                specifies a range of stream/unit numbers.  You
                           can  specify  this  range  instead of a single
                           stream/unit number.  The colon  must  separate
                           the   two   numbers.   The  n  represents  the
                           low-order number, and  the  m  represents  the
                           high-order number.

   Arguments

        nn                 specifies the stream number or unit number  to
                           be started.  You must specify a stream or unit
                           number.

        n:m                specifies a range of stream/unit numbers.  You
                           can  specify  this  range  instead of a single
                           stream/unit number.  The colon  must  separate
                           the   two   numbers.   The  n  represents  the
                           low-order number, and  the  m  represents  the
                           high-order number.


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies a remote node for which the  command
                           will   be   effective.    For   example,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026 to specify the node named KL1026.
                           If  you do not specify a node identifier, your
                           own node is the default.

        /DEVICE:dev:       specifies that printer output be written to  a
                           named  device.  This switch is useful when you
                           must transfer printer output from one site  to
                           another,  or  when  you  have printer hardware
                           problems.  Before you use  the  START  PRINTER
                           command  with the /DEVICE switch, you must set
                           the device as unavailable for  user  requests.
                                                                  _______                           (For  additional  information, see the TOPS-10

   Function

        The STOP command temporarily  stops  the  following  devices  and
        streams:

         o  Batch streams

         o  Card punches

         o  FAL streams

         o  Plotters

         o  Printers

         o  Card readers

   You can use the STOP command to halt a device when a hardware  problem
   occurs.

   When you use the STOP command, the device  remains  active,  and  jobs
   requesting  that  device  can  still  be scheduled.  However, when you
   specify the argument, AFTER EVERY-REQUEST, the device stops  after  it
   completes each job request.

   Use the CONTINUE command to reactivate a device or stream after a STOP
   command has been issued.

   2.62  SUPPRESS   2.62  SUPPRESS




   Function

        The SUPPRESS command allows you  to  convert  all  vertical  form
        motion characters to single-space characters.  All form feeds and
        multiple line feeds are converted to a single line  feed.   Thus,
        the  paging motion in a printer-job request is ignored.  However,
        this command does not cause printing to occur  across  the  forms
        page burst (perforation).

        The SUPPRESS command is useful when you want  to  stop  a  user's
        program  that  caused  a  print  loop,  for example when bad code
        causes too many form feeds.  When this happens, you can stop  the
        printer,  issue  the  SUPPRESS  command,  and  then  continue the
        printer, thus saving paper.  To continue printing  normally,  use
        this command with /STOP (SUPPRESS PRINTER n/STOP).

        You must specify the PRINTER keyword and unit number.


   Format

        OPR>SUPPRESS keyword nn /switch<RET>


   Keyword

        PRINTER nn         suppresses vertical motion  on  the  specified
                           line-printer.    You  must  include  the  unit
                           number.  (for example, 0 for LPT0, 1 for LPT1,
                           and so forth).


   Switches

        /NODE:identifier   specifies the name of a node in  the  network.
                           It  identifies  a  remote  node  for which the
                           command should be effective.  For example,  to
                           specify    the    node   named   KL1026,   use
                           /NODE:KL1026.  If you do not  specify  a  node
                           identifier, your own node is the default.

        /FILE              specifies the file  currently  being  printed.
                           (Refer   to  the  BACKSPACE  and  FORWARDSPACE
                           commands.)

        /JOB               specifies the  job  currently  being  printed.
                           With  the  /JOB  switch,  the  entire  job  is
                           suppressed, regardless of how  many  files  or
                           switches  were  specified  when  the  job  was
                           originally queued to print.  The  /JOB  switch
                           is the default of the SUPPRESS command.

        /STOP              specifies that normal printing is  to  resume,
                           and  that  the  carriage  control  on the line
                           printer is no longer to be  suppressed.   When
                           you  specify  this  switch,  the  job  that is
                           currently printing reverts to  the  print  job
                           format that was being used before the SUPPRESS
                           command was issued.


   Examples

        1.  Use the SUPPRESS command to suppress paging  motion  on  line
            printer  0.  The SUPPRESS command affects the entire job that
            is currently being printed.

   Function

        The TAKE command automatically executes the commands in a command
        file.   A  typical  command file contains commands that perform a
        series of  related  tasks.   For  example,  the  SYSTEM.CMD  file
        contains  OPR  commands  that  set  and start devices and streams
        automatically.

   Keyword

        filespec           specifies  the  input  file  name   and   file
                           extension   of  the  file  that  contains  the
                           executable OPR commands.  The  file  name  can
                           consist   of   no  more  than  6  alphanumeric
                           characters.  The file extension can consist of
                           no  more  than 3 alphanumeric characters.  The
                           standard extension for command files  is  CMD,
                           but   any   specified  extension  works.   The
                           filespec can  be  a  full  file  specification
                           consisting of:

                           where str:  is the file structure,  filnam  is
                           the file name, .ext is the file extension, and
                           [PPN] is the  project-programmer  number.   If
                           you  do  not specify the str:, OPR defaults to

                           any  error  messages  that  occur, and the OPR
                           commands after they have been executed.

        /NODISPLAY         does not display the OPR commands  that  exist
                           in  the  command  file  after their execution.

   2.64  UNLOCK   2.64  UNLOCK




   Function

        The UNLOCK command allows you to  permit  timesharing  users  and
        batch jobs to access a particular structure currently LOCKed from
        system allocation.  The UNLOCK command reverses the effect of the
        LOCK command.


   Format

        OPR>UNLOCK structure-name:  date-and-time<RET>


   Arguments

        structure-name:    specifies a 1- to 4-character  structure  name
                           that   is   currently   LOCKed   from   system
                           allocation.  The structure must be mounted and
                           on-line.  The name must end with a colon (:).

        date-and-time      specifies an optional date and time  when  the
                           structure  will  be UNLOCKed so that users can
                           access it.  The  date  is  in  the  format  of
                           "mm-dd-yy,"  where  mm is the month, dd is the
                           day, and yy is the year, separated by hyphens.
                           The time is in the format of "hh:mm," where hh
                           is the hour and mm is the  minutes,  separated
                           by  a  colon.   The  time applies to a 24-hour
                           clock.


   Restrictions

        If you specify a structure name not known to the system, you  get
        the following error message:

             ? No such device

        If you specify a structure name that is currently  UNLOCKed,  you
        get the following message:

             hh:mm:ss         -- Structure name already UNLOCKed --

        If you specify an optional date without a time, the time defaults
        to 00:00:00 (or the start of that date).

   Function

        The UNRESTRICT command returns a  restricted  device  to  general

   2.66  WAIT   2.66  WAIT




   Function

        The WAIT command is used with batch control files to prevent  OPR
        from  accepting  a  command before a previously issued command is
        finished being processed.

        The OPR program  is  designed  to  accept  and  process  commands
        immediately,  and the batch system (BATCON) will send commands to
        OPR as soon as the previous command is accepted.

        Most OPR commands require processing  by  other  modules  of  the
        operating  system.   OPR can accept a command, dispatch it to the
        appropriate module, and accept another  command  from  the  batch
        file  before  the  output  from the first command returns to OPR.
        For example, it is possible for an EXIT command in the batch file
        to  be  processed  before  the  response to the previously issued
        command is displayed.  The WAIT command should be entered between
        the  previous  command  and  the EXIT command, to allow the first
        command to finish processing before the EXIT command is  sent  to
        OPR.

   Format

        OPR>WAIT n

        where n is the number of seconds  that  OPR  should  wait  before
        accepting  the  next  command  in the batch file.  The value of n
        must be between 1 and 60.

   Warning

        Using the WAIT command does NOT guarantee that  the  output  from
        the  first command will be successfully displayed before the EXIT
        command is accepted and processed by  OPR.   OPR  will,  however,
        WAIT  the  specified  number  of seconds, and the output from the
        first command will  be  displayed  if  it  is  ready  before  the
        specified number of seconds is up.

   Example

        The following batch file may be submitted to the batch system:

        @ENABLE
        $OPR
        *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE
        *EXIT

                                    WAIT


        When this job is processed, the SHOW STATUS command is issued and
        accepted  by  OPR,  passed  to ORION for processing, and then the
        output is passed back through OPR  to  BATCON.   However,  BATCON
        will  send  the EXIT command immediately after OPR dispatches the
        SHOW STATUS command.  When OPR  receives  the  EXIT  command,  it
        causes  the  batch  job  to exit from OPR immediately, before the
        output from SHOW STATUS is received by OPR.

        The following batch file uses the WAIT command to  cause  OPR  to
        WAIT  for  the  specified  number of seconds before accepting the
        EXIT command:

        @ENABLE
        $OPR
        *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE

   After you enter a command subset, there are  two  levels  of  commands
   available  to  you:   a limited number of OPR commands, and the subset
   commands themselves.  All of the subsets  include  the  following  OPR
   commands as top-level (OPR) commands:

         o  ENTER

         o  EXIT

         o  PUSH

         o  TAKE

         o  WAIT

   These commands function at the subset level exactly as they do at  OPR
   command  level.   See  Chapter  2  for  more  information  about these
   commands.

   3.3  CATALOG COMMANDS   3.3  CATALOG COMMANDS

   The CATALOG  program  maintains  the  system  catalog  files  and  the
   information about the volume-sets stored in those files.  The operator
   interface to the CATALOG program is the CATALOG  application  in  OPR.
   System Administrator privileges are required.

   This section describes the CATALOG commands listed below:

         o  DELETE

         o  DISABLE

         o  ENABLE

         o  HELP

                           the catalog.

        STRUCTURE          deletes  the  specified  structure  volume-set
                           from the catalog.


   Argument

        volume-set name    specifies  the  name  of  the  volume-set  for
                           magtape  or DECtape or structure-name for disk
                           to be deleted.


   Restriction

        Due to the destructive nature of the  DELETE  command,  you  must
        specify  the  entire volume-set or structure-name.  Abbreviations
        are not allowed.


   Example

        Delete the DSKD entry from the system catalog.

        AUTO-RELOAD        automatically reloads the  monitor  after  the
                           monitor crashes or has been down.

        BOOT-TEXT          specifies the BOOT-TEXT command  string.   The
                           BOOT-TEXT command string is the command string
                           passed  to  the  bootstrap  on  an   automatic
                           monitor reload.

        DUMP               causes the monitor to take  continuable  dumps
                           after the specified stopcodes.

        IGNORE argument    causes the monitor device service  routine  to
                           ignore  on-line  interrupts from the specified
                           device  until  you   enter   a   SET NO IGNORE
                           command.

        KLINIK             sets KLINIK parameters for the specified  CPU.
                           If  you  do not specify a CPU, SET KLINIK sets
                           the parameters for all CPUs.  This keyword has
                           a subcommand level, described below.

                           specified type of stopcode.

        POLICY-CPU         sets the policy CPU to be CPUn.

        RELOAD             enables reloading of  the  monitor  after  the
                           specified type of stopcode.


   BOOT-TEXT Argument

                           command-string specifies  the  command  string
                           passed   to  the  bootstrap  on  an  automatic
                           monitor   reload.    Because   the   bootstrap
                           interprets   a   space  as  an  end-of-command
                           character, you can specify  multiple  commands
                           on  the  same  line by separating the commands
                           with spaces.  The command string  starts  with
                           the  first  non-space, non-tab character after
                           the keyword "BOOT-TEXT",  and  ends  when  you
                           press <RET>.

                                                NOTE

                               The bootstrap does  not  automatically
                               dump   the  memory  image  unless  you
                               specify the /D  bootstrap  command  as
                               the first element of the argument.

   KLINIK Arguments

             ALL-CPUs      sets KLINIK parameters for all CPUs.  This  is
                           the default.

             CPUn          sets KLINIK parameters for the specified CPU.


        Press RETURN to enter KLINIK subcommand  level.   KLINIK  prompts
        for the mode to set the KLINIK link.  For example:

                 ___ ___________             OPR>SET KLINIK<RET>
             KLINIK link:

        You must supply one of the following:

             OFF           shuts off the KLINIK links currently open.

             REMOTE        specifies the link will act as a remote system
                           CTY.

             USER          specifies  the   link   will   have   ordinary
                           timesharing user status.

        If you type USER, you must specify the date  and  time  when  the
        link is available.  For example:

                           _________             KLINIK mode:  USER<RET>

   Function

        The SUSPEND command suspends system operation and writes a system
        dump  file.   You  can  later  reload  the  dump  file  with  the
        BOOT/REBOOT switch and continue the system.  You  must  supply  a
        single-line  reason  for  suspending  the system when you use the
        SUSPEND command.  CONFIG stores the address of the reason  string
        in  AC  0.   The  reason  for the dump can later be determined by
        examining user AC 0.   You  must  perform  all  logical  software
        reconfiguration that is needed before a system is suspended.

        To record system configuration before suspension, you can use the
        SHOW HARDWARE-CONFIGURATION command.  Then use SUSPEND to suspend
        system operations.


                                      NOTE

                To prevent accidental use of the SUSPEND command,
                OPR does not permit you to abbreviate the command
                or to press <ESC> to complete the command.

   This section provides information about the  Network  Control  Program
   (NCP)  command  subset.  It is a quick reference guide for experienced
                                                          _______  ______   NCP users.  If you have never used NCP, please see the TOPS-10  DECnet
   ___  ___  ______ _________ ___ __________ _____   and  PSI  System Manager's and Operator's Guide before you use any NCP
   commands.

   NCP's two main functions are to control  and  monitor  DECnet  network
   activity.  Some of the tasks you perform with NCP include:

         o  Changing parameters

         o  Monitoring local and remote DECnet nodes

         o  Loading and starting adjacent nodes

         o  Gathering information about the DECnet network

                                  WARNING

           Some NCP commands have the potential  to  disrupt  the
           entire  network.   Several commands will, if formatted
           with valid but ill-chosen parameters, disrupt your own
           node's   performance.   Never  enter  an  NCP  command
           without  a  complete  understanding  of  the  probable
           effect  of  the  command.   Do not make changes in the
           permanent  data  base  of  a   remote   node   without
           consulting the system manager at the remote node.

   3.7  QUOTA COMMANDS   3.7  QUOTA COMMANDS

   The QUOTA application in OPR enables you to maintain disk space  quota
   entries in the QUOTA.SYS file and in ACTDAE.SYS.  QUOTA.SYS contains a
   list of users for the private structure  on  which  the  users'  files
   reside.   Creating  entries  in  ACTDAE.SYS  causes LOGIN to mount the
   specified structures.  System Administrator privileges are required.

   With QUOTA, you can do the following:

         o  create a user's quota

         o  delete a user's quota

         o  list a user's quota

         o  change a user's quota

         o  display a user's quota

                                    NOTE

           You must have SYSTEM operator privileges  to  use  the
           QUOTA  application.   SYSTEM operator privileges allow
           you to control devices and tasks on  the  host  system
           and remote nodes.

                                    ADD



   Function

        The ADD command creates entries in QUOTA.SYS or  ACTDAE.SYS.   If
        you  specify  the  /MOUNT  switch,  QUOTA  writes  the  entry  in
        ACTDAE.SYS.  If you do  not  specify  the  /MOUNT  switch,  QUOTA
        writes the entry in <STRUCTURE>:QUOTA.SYS[1,4].


   Format

        QUOTA>ADD userid structure quota-in quota-out /switches<RET>


        userid             specifies a user's project-programmer  number,
                           or  a  user  name.   You  must  include quotes
                           around   a   user   name   if   it    contains
                           non-alphabetic     characters.     Both    the
                           project-programmer number and  the  user  name
                           may include wildcards.

        structure          specifies a device  name,  which  can  be  any
                           structure name.

        quota-in
        quota-out          specifies a  user's  logged-in  or  logged-out
                           quota in 128-word blocks.  You may specify the
                           quota as one of the following:

                            o  a positive decimal number

                            o  the word INFINITE to indicate the  largest
                               possible 36-bit integer.


   Switches

        /MOUNT             creates an entry for the  specified  structure
                           in  ACTDAE.SYS  and in the user's LOGIN search
                           list.  If you include the /MOUNT  switch,  the
                           structure must be cataloged and accessible.

        /NOCREATE          sets the NOCREATE status  bit  when  the  user
                           logs  in.   This  bit  prohibits the user from
                           creating files on  the  structure  unless  the
                           user   specifies   the   structure  name  when
                           creating a file.  The /NOCREATE switch applies
                           only if you specified the /MOUNT switch.

                           The user will not be able to create  files  on
                           the  structure.   The  /NOWRITE switch applies

        userid             specifies a user's project-programmer  number,
                           or  a  user  name.   You  must  include quotes
                           around   a   user   name   if   it    contains
                           non-alphabetic     characters.     Both    the
                           project-programmer number and  the  user  name
                           may include wildcards.

        structure          specifies a device  name,  which  can  be  any
                           structure  name.   If you specify a structure,
                           the structure must be accessible.  QUOTA lists
                           only the QUOTA.SYS entries for that structure.

   Format

        QUOTA>MODIFY userid structure quota-in quota-out /switches<RET>


        userid             specifies a user's project-programmer  number,
                           or  a  user  name.   You  must  include quotes
                           around   a   user   name   if   it    contains
                           non-alphabetic     characters.     Both    the
                           project-programmer number and  the  user  name
                           may include wildcards.

        structure          specifies a device  name,  which  can  be  any
                           structure  name.   If you include the /NOMOUNT
                           switch, the structure must  be  cataloged  and
                           accessible.

        quota-in
        quota-out          specifies a  user's  logged-in  or  logged-out
                           quota in 128-word blocks.  You may specify the
                           quota as one of the following:

                            o  a positive decimal number

                            o  the word INFINITE to indicate the  largest
                               possible 36-bit integer.

                            o  the word SAME to indicate no change to the
                               quota


   Switches

        /CREATE            clears the NOCREATE status for  the  specified

                           specified the /MOUNT switch.

        /MOUNT             modifies an entry for the specified  structure
                           in  ACTDAE.SYS  and in the user's LOGIN search
                           list.

                               QUOTA COMMANDS


        /NOMOUNT           modifies an entry in the  QUOTA.SYS  file  for
                           the  specified  structure.   If you create the
                           entry with the /NOMOUNT switch, the user  must
                           specifically  MOUNT  the structure; LOGIN does
                           not automatically try to  mount  it  when  the
                           user logs in.

        /NOCREATE          sets the NOCREATE status  bit  when  the  user
                           logs  in.   This  bit  prohibits the user from
                           creating files on  the  structure  unless  the
                           user   specifies   the   structure  name  when
                           creating a file.  The /NOCREATE switch applies
                           only if you specified the /MOUNT switch.

        /NOWRITE           write-locks the specified  structure  for  the
                           specified  user's  job  when the user logs in.
                           The  /NOWRITE  switch  applies  only  if   you
                           specified the /MOUNT switch.

        /WRITE             clears the write-lock status for the specified
                           entry.   The /WRITE switch applies only if you
                           specified the /MOUNT switch.

   Format

        QUOTA>SHOW userid structure <RET>


        userid             specifies a user's project-programmer  number,
                           or  a  user  name.   You  must  include quotes
                           around   a   user   name   if   it    contains
                           non-alphabetic     characters.     Both    the
                           project-programmer number and  the  user  name
                           may include wildcards.

        structure          specifies a device name.  The device name  can
                           be  any structure name, and the structure must
                           be accessible.   The  structure  qualifier  is
                           optional.   If  you specify a structure, QUOTA
                           displays only the QUOTA.SYS entries  for  that

   The commands in this chapter change  various  system  parameters  and,
   therefore,  are  restricted  to  users  who are logged in under [1,2],
   only.  All commands, when executed,  leave  the  terminal  in  monitor
   mode.   Chapter  5  describes the operator-privileged commands for the
   OPSER system program.

         o  The job is not at monitor command level

         o  The job has the TTY GAG bit set

         o  The terminal is in IMAGE mode or Packet Image Mode (PIM)

        In addition, if the destination terminal is hardwired and  turned
        off,  your message is not sent.  However, it appears to have been
        sent because the software  cannot  detect  an  OFF  condition  on
        hardwired terminals.

        If you try to send a message to a terminal not at monitor command
        level, you receive a BUSY message, and your message is not sent.

   4.9  SET BREAK   4.9  SET BREAK




   Function

        The SET BREAK command makes the address break facility  available
        to users.  It also prevents the address break facility from being
        available to users if you wish to make  it  available  to  system
        programmers for their exclusive use.

        The address break facility  of  the  hardware  makes  a  powerful
        debugging  facility  available  to  users of the system.  To make
        this feature available, the monitor must set  the  address  where
        the  user  is  breaking  into  the address switches and the break
        conditions into the break conditions register.

        The default setting when the  monitor  is  loaded  is  SET  BREAK
        USERS.


   Format

        SET BREAK USERS

        or

        SET BREAK NO USERS


   Arguments

        USERS              specifies that users of the  system  be  given
                           the   address   break  facility.   The  system
                           changes  the  address   switches   and   break
                           conditions  for  programs being debugged using
                           address break.

        NO USERS           specifies that the message "?Not available" be
                           printed  on  a  user's  terminal  if  the user
                           attempts to use the address break facility.

   Restriction

        The SET BREAK command is not applicable on KS10  systems  because
        the hardware is not capable of the address break facility.

        Associated messages are:

        ?Not available

             You tried to SET BREAK  NO  USERS,  but  the  address  break
             facility was already in use by one or more users.


   Example

        You give the SET BREAK USERS command to allow all  users  to  use
        the address break facility.

   4.10  SET CORMAX   4.10  SET CORMAX




   Function

        The SET CORMAX command changes the system parameter CORMAX.   The
        largest  size  that any job (sum of low and high segments) can be
        is CORMAX-1.


   Format

        SET CORMAX n


   Argument

        n                  specifies a decimal  number  representing  nK.
                           The  minimum  value  of  n  is 10, unless this
                           value was  changed  at  system  generation  or
                           system initialization time.

   4.11  SET CORMIN   4.11  SET CORMIN




   Function

        The SET CORMIN  command  changes  the  system  parameter  CORMIN.
        CORMIN  is the guaranteed amount of contiguous core that a single
        unlocked job can have.  This command is used only with a  monitor
        that  has  the  capability  of  locking  jobs  in core (usually a
        real-time monitor).


   Format

        SET CORMIN n


   Argument

        n                  specifies a decimal number representing nK.


   Example

        You set the CORMIN parameter to 256K.

   4.12  SET CPU   4.12  SET CPU




   Function

        The SET CPU command specifies  which  CPU  in  a  multiprocessing
        system  will run your job.  You can specify that processing occur
        on the primary CPU, the secondary CPU, or on either CPU.


   Format

        SET CPU keyword argument<RET>


   Arguments

        U         designates a logical name

        L         designates a KL processor

        n         is a number from 0 to 5, depending  on  the  number  of
                  processors in the system.

        NO CPxn            removes the specified CPU  from  the  list  of
                           CPUs your job can use.

        CPU ALL            adds all of the CPUs to the list of CPUs  your
                           job can use.

        ONLY CPxn          changes  the  CPU  specification  so  that  it
                           includes only the specified CPU.

   Restrictions

        The SET CPU command for a particular CPU remains in effect  until
        one of the following occurs:

         o  You issue another SET CPU command specifying a different CPU.

         o  You issue a KJOB command.

         o  Your program overrides the SET CPU  command  by  issuing  the
            SETUUO monitor call with a different specification.


        The SETUUO monitor call for a particular CPU  remains  in  effect
        until one of the following occurs:

         o  The RESET or EXIT monitor call causes the job  to  revert  to
            the CPU specified in the last SET CPU command.

         o  Another SETUUO monitor call specifies a different CPU.

        When you log in, the CPU specification is  usually  set  to  ALL.
        Each  CPU  scheduler competes for jobs with the ALL specification
        so that the job load is balanced between CPUs.  Therefore, you do
        not generally need to use the SET CPU.


   Examples

        1.  Your job can run only on CPU1.

   4.13  SET DATE   4.13  SET DATE




   Function

        The SET DATE command changes  the  system  date.   However,  this
        command  does  not check the validity of the date argument, as is
        done at system initialization.

        To display the current  system  date,  use  the  monitor  command
        DAYTIME.


   Format

        SET DATE mm-dd-yy


   Argument

        mm-dd-yy           specifies the month, day, and year of the date
                           argument.  The month, day, and year are each a
                           2-character  decimal   number   separated   by
                           hyphens.

   Format

        SET DAYTIME nnnn


   Argument

        nnnn               specifies a decimal number from  0000  through
                           2359,   representing   a  24-hour  time.   For

   4.15  SET MEMORY   4.15  SET MEMORY




   Function

        The SET MEMORY command alters  the  system  memory  configuration
        dynamically  without affecting system operation.  This command is
        most useful for removing faulty memory from the system, returning
        repaired memory to the system, or reconfiguring memory on systems
        that contain multiple CPUs.   If  this  command  is  successfully
        executed, the specified memory is set on- or off-line.


   Format

        SET MEMORY ON-LINE FROM n TO m

        or

        SET MEMORY OFF-LINE FROM n TO m

        where FROM and TO are optional portions of the command line.


   Argument

        n,m                specifies the number range  (n  less  than  or
                           equal to m) of the physical addresses that are
                           to be set ON-or  OFF-LINE.   The  numbers  are
                           treated as decimal, unless preceded by a pound
                           sign (#)  implying  octal.   If  a  number  is
                           followed by the letter P or K, the range is in
                           pages (P) or blocks (K).  If neither P  nor  K
                           is specified, then K is the default.  Refer to
                           the  SET   VMMAX   command   for   a   further
                           description of K and P.

             The range of addresses specified in a  SET  MEMORY  OFF-LINE
             command  overlaps the resident monitor.  The memory occupied
             by the resident monitor cannot be set off-line.

        ?JOB(S) TOO BIG TO CONTINUE TO RUN
             ?PROBLEM WITH JOB(S) n1[prog1],n2[prog2],...nn[progn]

             If the range of addresses specified in a SET MEMORY OFF-LINE
             command  were  taken  off-line, the jobs listed would be too
             big to continue to run.  The job numbers and  program  names
             are listed so that you can ATTACH to the jobs, log them out,
             and type the command  again  if  you  wish  the  command  to
             succeed.

        ?ATTEMPT TO SET MEMORY CONTAINING LOCKED JOBS OFF-LINE
             ?PROBLEM WITH JOB(S) n1[prog1],n2[prog2],...nn[progn]

             The range of addresses specified in a  SET  MEMORY  OFF-LINE
             command  overlaps  memory containing jobs that are locked in
             core.  The job numbers and program names are listed so  that
             you  can  ATTACH  to  the  jobs,  log them out, and type the
             command again, if you wish the command to succeed.

        ?p NXM ERRS FROM n TO m

             When a SET MEMORY ON-LINE command is  executed,  the  system
             references  the memory in the range specified in the command
             to ensure that it actually exists and  is  on-line.   Should
             any nonexistent memory be encountered during this procedure,
             the range of nonexistent locations (n,m) is reported on  the
             OPR  terminal  along  with the number of errors (p), and the
             memory in that range is treated as off-line.

   4.16  SET NOMESSAGE   4.16  SET NOMESSAGE




   Function

        The SET NOMESSAGE command suppresses messages from disk and  tape
        devices, and from DL10-based PDP-11 nodes.  Normally, when one of
        these devices goes off-line unexpectedly, a message  is  sent  to
        the  operator's console once-a-minute.  The SET NOMESSAGE command
        controls those types of messages.  One of the messages you  might
        see is:

        UNIT device-name WENT OFF-LINE
        PLEASE POWER DOWN AND TURN IT ON AGAIN


   Format

        To suppress tape controller messages, use the following format:

        SET NOMESSAGE MTx


   Argument

        x    is the name of the controller that is sending messages.


   Format

        To suppress messages from disk units, use the following format:

        SET NOMESSAGE RPxn


   Argument

        RPxn      is the disk unit, including  controller  name  (x)  and
                  unit number (n).


   Format

        To suppress messages from  a  DL10-based  PDP-11  node,  use  the
        format:

        SET NOMESSAGE PDP-11 n

   Format

        The  SET  NOMESSAGE  command  also  controls  the  messages  from
        specific  types  of  disk errors.  RIB error messages are counted
        from  system  startup,  and  messages  from  RIB  errors  may  be
        suppressed  by  setting the RIB error message threshold RIBERN at
        system generation, or with the SET NOMESSAGE  command.   Use  the
        following  format  of  SET NOMESSAGE to set the message threshold
        from RIB errors:

        SET NOMESSAGE RIB n


   Argument

        n    is the number of RIB error messages to be suppressed  before
             beginning  to  print them on the CTY.  The default threshold
             is 0 so that all RIB error messages are printed.  Note  that
             the  total  number  of RIB error messages is reset to 0 only
             when the system is reloaded.


   Format

        SET  NOMESSAGE  suppresses  messages  reporting   non-recoverable
        (hard)  errors  from  disk  units.  You can use the SET NOMESSAGE
        command to set the threshold for hard error  messages  from  disk
        units with the following command:

        SET NOMESSAGE DSKERR n


   Argument

        n    is the number of messages to be suppressed  before  printing
             one message.  When the number of hard error messages exceeds
             n, a message is printed on the CTY.  Note that  the  counter
             of  hard  error  messages  is  reset  to 0 when a message is
             printed on the CTY.  The system default threshold  for  hard
             disk  error  messages  is  25.  Therefore, by default, every
             twenty-sixth message is printed on the CTY.

   Example

        You turn off the once-a-minute message for disk drive RPA2.

   Argument

        nnnn           specifies an octal number which is stored  in  the
                       right  half  of  the  STATES  word in COMMON.  The
                       following  values  for  "nnnn"  have   independent
                       meanings,    and    several   can   be   specified
                       concurrently by adding the  values  together  (see
                       example).

                       0     specifies  regular  timesharing  and   batch
                             operations.

                       1     specifies no further LOGINs  allowed  except
                             from the CTY.

                       2     specifies  no  further  LOGINs  from  remote
                             terminals, and do not answer data sets.

                       4     specifies batch operation only.

                       10    specifies stand-alone operation only.

                       200   specifies that unspooling is allowed.

                       400   specifies no operator coverage.

                       1000  specifies to inhibit automatic execution  of
                             NETLDR.
   Example

        You set the system schedule to 15.  This allows you  to  run  the
        system  as  stand-alone,  batch  operations  only,  and no LOGINs
        except from the CTY (a combination of 1, 4, and 10).

        ALTMODE            converts the ALTMODE codes of 175 and  176  to
                           the   standard   ASCII  ESCape  character  033
                           (initial state if, at monitor generation,  the
                           TTYALT  symbol  is assigned a non-zero value).
                           NO ALTMODE restores the individual identity of
                           the codes 175 and 176.

        BLANKS             restores multiple carriage  return/line  feeds
                           and form feeds (initial state).

        NO BLANKS          suppresses blank lines  (consecutive  carriage
                           return/line feeds after the first) and outputs
                           form feeds and vertical tabs as  two  carriage
                           return/line feeds.  This is useful for a video
                           display terminal  in  order  to  increase  the
                           amount of output that fits on the screen.

        COPY               controls output of ESCape characters  to  VT5x
        NO COPY            terminals only.

        CRLF               restores the  free  carriage  return  (initial

        NO CRLF            suppresses the free carriage  return  normally
                           output  at  the  end  of  a line exceeding the
                           carriage width.

        DEFER              suppresses terminal  echoing  until  the  user
                           program or monitor asks for the characters.

                           This means that programs that are doing cursor
                           control  or are handling their own rubouts can
                           get the screen  image  correct  without  doing
                           their own echoing.

        NO DEFER           turns off the SET TTY TTYn: DEFER command.

        DISPLAY            notifies the system that the terminal you  are
                           using is a display terminal.

        NO DISPLAY         turns off the SET TTY TTYn: DISPLAY command.

        ECHO               restores the normal echoing of each  character
                           entered.   Most terminals for TOPS-10 are used
                           in full  duplex  mode  which  means  that  the
                           terminal  does not print each character as the
                           user types it.   Instead  the  monitor  echoes
                           each  character typed so that the character is
                           printed.  If a terminal prints C  when  it  is
                           typed but does not print any of the noncontrol
                           characters  typed  by  the  user,  then   this
                           command   can  be  used  to  establish  normal
                           echoing.  (Each  installation  determines  the
                           initial setting when generating its monitor at
                           system generation time.)

        NO ECHO            suppresses   monitor    echoing    of    input
                           characters.   Local  copy  terminals (that is,
                           terminals  which  automatically   print   each
                           character as the user types it) do not require
                           monitor  echoing  because  the  echoing  would
                           cause  each  character  typed  to  be  printed
                           twice.  This command is used  to  stop  double
                           printing  of  each  character  on a local copy
                           terminal.  (The initial setting is  determined
                           by  each  installation  when  constructing its
                           monitor at system generation time.)

        FILL n             assigns filler class n to this terminal.  Many
                           different  types of terminals are supported by
                           the TOPS-10 operating system.  Some  terminals
                           require  one  or  more filler characters to be
                           sent following certain control characters such
                           as  line  feed  (LF)  and horizontal tab (HT).
                           Table 4-1 illustrates the  number  of  fillers

                           sent for each character and filler class.  The
                           filler characters are CR (215 octal  for  even
                           parity)  for  carriage  return characters (CR,
                           215 octal) and DEL (RUBOUT, 377 octal) for all
                           other  character.  No fillers are supplied for
                           image mode output.  (The  initial  setting  is
                           determined    by    each   installation   when
                           constructing its monitor at system  generation
                           time.

        NO FILL            is equivalent to TTY  FILL  0.   (The  initial

        HOLD               controls use of scroll key  on  VT5x terminals
        NO HOLD            only.

        IGNORE             allows you to disable a line.  The  line  will
                           be ignored by the PDP-11.

        NO IGNORE          turns off the SET TTY TTYn: IGNORE command.

        LC                 suppresses  the   translation   of   lowercase
                           character input to uppercase.

        NO LC              causes  the  monitor  to  translate  lowercase
                           characters  to uppercase as they are received.
                           Frequently,  it  is  convenient  to   have   a
                           terminal  with both uppercase and lowercase to
                           simulate the behavior of  one  with  uppercase
                           only.   This  command  causes  the  monitor to
                           perform this simulation.  The echo  sent  back
                           by  the monitor always matches the case of the
                           characters after translation.  By  looking  at
                           the  printout,  the  user  can  determine what
                           translation  was  performed  by  the   monitor
                           (initial state).

        PAGE n             gives the  user  the  ability  to  temporarily
                           suspend system typeout without losing it.  The
                           XOFF key <CTRL/S> suspends  the  typeout,  and
                           the  XON  key  <CTRL/Q>  restores  it  for "n"
                           lines.  The XOFF and XON are  not  echoed  and
                           are  not  sent  to  the  user's program.  This
                           command is useful for video display  terminals
                           so  that  the  user  can  read  a page of text
                           before it disappears from  the  screen.   Note
                           that  it  preempts  the  user  of <CTRL/S> and
                           <CTRL/Q> for reading paper tape.  (See SET TTY

                           of these keys depends on the last SET TTY TAPE
                           command (initial state).

        RTCOMP             disables the <CTRL/R>  (reprint  current  line

                           passed to the user program.

        NO RTCOMP          turns  on  the  <CTRL/R>  and   the   <CTRL/T>
                           feature.

        SLAVE              specifies that the terminal becomes slaved, so
                           that no commands can be typed on the terminal.
                           The terminal can then be ASSIGNed  by  another
                           user.   You  can  slave any terminal including
                           your own.  (The initial setting is  determined
                           by  each  installation  when  constructing its
                           monitor at system generation time.)

        NO SLAVE           specifies that the terminal  becomes  unslaved
                           so  that  commands  can  now  be  typed on the
                           console.  If OPR  is  slaved,  you  can  LOGIN
                           under  [1,2]  on  another  terminal to unslave
                           OPR.  (The initial setting  is  determined  by
                           each   installation   when   constructing  its
                           monitor at system generation time.

        SPEED n            sets the speed at which the system  sends  and
                           receives characters to n baud.  (The user must
                           adjust the speed at the terminal by setting  a
                           switch.)

        SPEED m,n          sets the terminal transmitting speed to m baud
                           and  the  receiving speed to n baud.  (This is
                           especially useful for display  terminals  that
                           allow  transmitting and receiving at different
                           speeds.)

        NO TAB             specifies  that  the  monitor  simulates   tab
                           output  from programs by sending the necessary
                           number of space characters.

        TAPE               specifies that the XON key <CTRL/Q> causes the
                           terminal  to  read  paper  tape.  The XOFF key
                           <CTRL/S> causes the terminal to  stop  reading
                           paper  tape.   Rubouts  are  ignored  and free
                           CRLFs are not sent.

        NO TAPE            specifies that the XON key  <CTRL/Q>  and  the
                           XOFF  key  <CTRL/S> have no special paper tape
                           function.  They  can,  however,  have  a  page

   Function

        The SET VMMAX command specifies the  maximum  amount  of  virtual
        memory available to all users of the system.

        After the execution of this command, the new value  of  VMMAX  is
        one of the following:

        1.  The total amount of allocated swapping space, if n is greater
            than the total amount allocated.

        2.  The amount currently in use by all virtual memory users, if n
            is less than the total amount in use.

        3.  The value of n, if neither of the above is true.

   Function

        The XCHNGE command enables a system  with  a  bad  disk  unit  to
        continue   without   unnecessary  user  disruption  by  logically

   Argument

        diskunitn:         specifies the disk unit you want  to  exchange
                           with  another  disk  unit.   For  example, you
                           exchange RPA0 for RPA2.

                                              CAUTION

                               Careless  use  of  this  command   can
                               destroy   information  on  disk  packs
                               because the monitor assumes  that  the
                               physical disk packs have been switched
                               by you.  For that  reason,  both  disk
                               drives  should  be powered down before
                               issuing the command.   One  precaution
                               the  monitor  does  take whenever this
                               command is issued is to  automatically
                               place  both  disk drives off-line.  It
                               is up to you to then switch  the  disk
                               packs  before  placing  the units back
                               on-line.

   5.1  INTRODUCTION TO OPSER   5.1  INTRODUCTION TO OPSER

   The TOPS-10 operating system considers  all  jobs  to  be  timesharing
   jobs;  thus,  each  job must be associated with a timesharing terminal
   (TTY).  In some situations, however, it is inconvenient to  require  a
   timesharing  terminal  to  be  associated with every job on the system
   (for example, where many jobs are needed for  a  single  application).
   OPSER  provides  a  method  whereby a single job running from a single
   timesharing terminal can control many subjobs simultaneously.   To  do
   this,  OPSER  implements a "device" called a pseudo-terminal (PTY).  A
   PTY is a software simulation of a terminal.  The controlling  program,
   OPSER,  can  send  information to a PTY and receive information from a
   PTY.

   OPSER starts running subjobs by means of pseudo-terminals and controls
   each  subjob  by  sending  appropriate  information  (for example, the
   commands or data you give it) over the  PTY  controlling  the  subjob.
   You  can  run as many subjobs as there are PTYs on the system, up to a
   maximum of 14.  Through OPSER you  can  control  many  jobs  from  one
   terminal.



   5.2  STARTING OPSER   5.2  STARTING OPSER

   OPSER normally starts when the system is brought  up.   At  this  time
   OPSER  reads  and processes the file SYS:OPR.ATO (an automatic startup
   file).  This file  contains  the  OPSER  commands  that  initiate  the
   running of system software programs such as input and output spoolers,
   components  of  the  batch  processing  system,  and  device-servicing
   programs (such as MOUNT).

   If OPSER has not been started  automatically,  you  can  start  it  by
   typing the following command:

         _ __________        .R OPSER<RET>
        *


                                    5-1
                           OPSER COMMAND LANGUAGE                           OPSER COMMAND LANGUAGE


   When OPSER displays an asterisk (*), type the following command:

         _____ ________________        *:AUTO SYS:OPR.ATO<RET>

   When OPSER finishes  processing  the  OPR.ATO  file,  it  displays  an
   asterisk or an exclamation point (!).  When OPSER displays an asterisk
   or exclamation  point,  you  can  enter  any  of  the  OPSER  commands
   described in this chapter.




   5.2.1  Commands to the OPSER Program   5.2.1  Commands to the OPSER Program

   You must precede each OPSER command by a colon (:), and you must  type
   enough  letters  to  make  the  command  unique.  The :WHAT command is
   unique at one character.  Therefore, :W is interpreted as :WHAT.

   OPSER prompts you with either an asterisk (*) or an exclamation  point
   (!)  when it is ready to receive your commands.  An asterisk indicates
   that no subjobs are active or a subjob is waiting for some  action  on
   your  part.   An  exclamation  point means that at least one subjob is
   currently active but you can still communicate with other subjobs.

   There are four methods of  specifying  subjobs  in  an  OPSER  command
   string.

        1.  Type the subjob number (or numbers).

        2.  Type the mnemonic you assigned to the job  with  the  :DEFINE
            command.

        3.  Use the word ALL, which indicates to OPSER that you want  the
            command to apply to all active subjobs.

        4.  Leave the subjob specification out entirely,  in  which  case
            OPSER  assumes  you  intend  the command to apply to the last
            subjob you referenced.

   If the previous command referenced a list of  subjobs,  the  last  one
   referenced is the default for any subsequent command.  For example, in
   the following sequence:

        _____ __ __ ______        :WHAT A, B, C<RET>
        __________        :STOP<RET>

   If A, B, and C  were  the  only  active  subjobs,  and  the  following
   commands were typed:

   C would again be the implicit argument of the :STOP command.



   5.2.2  Commands Directly to Subjobs   5.2.2  Commands Directly to Subjobs

   When you give commands to a subjob, you must indicate for which subjob
   (or  subjobs)  the  command  is  intended.   Do  this by preceding the
   command with the subjob number (or the name assigned by means  of  the
   :DEFINE  command)  and  a  hyphen.   If  you do not specify the subjob
   number or name in the  command,  the  command  defaults  to  the  last
   specified  subjob.  For example, to stop subjob 3 (defined as LP1) you
   could type:

         ______        !3-STOP        ;using the subjob number

          or

         ________        !LP1-STOP      ;using the subjob name

          or

         _____        !:STOP         ;if LP1 was the last specified subjob

   There is a method available in OPSER for sending the same  command  to
   all  the subjobs at once.  For example, if you want to know the status
   within each of the subjobs, instead of typing WHAT to each subjob, you
   can do it with a single command.  You simply type:

        _____ ________        :WHAT ALL<RET>

   and OPSER sends the WHAT command to each subjob.

   Whenever you enter a command to a subjob,  OPSER  will  timestamp  and
   identify the entry as follows:

        !hh:mm (xxx)

   where xxx is the subjob number or name used in the  preceding  command
   line.   For  example,  the  following  is  representative  of your CTY
   output.

        !S-R SPRINT    (operator command)
        !13:20(S)      (OPSER timestamp)
               /       (SPRINT prompt)

   Sample CTY output included in this  chapter  usually  omits  timestamp
   entries  in  the  interest  of  conserving space and reducing clutter.
   Actual OPSER output will be timestamped.

   Consider the following sequence of commands:

        STEP                     EXPLANATION

         _ __________        .R OPSER<RET>            Run the OPSER program.

         _____ __________        *:SLOG 2,167<RET>        Log in a subjob under [2,167].

         ____ _________        !:DEF FIL=<RET>          Associate subjob n with the name FIL.

         _____ ________        !:WHAT FIL<RET>          Print out the status of FIL.

         _____ ________        !FIL-R PIP<RET>          Tell FIL to run PIP.

         _______________________________        *FILC.EXT=FILA.EXT,FILB.EXT<RET>
                                 Use PIP to create one file from data  in
                                 two other files.

         _____ ________        !:STOP FIL<RET>          Return FIL to monitor mode.

         _____ ________        !:KJOB FIL<RET>          Log out FIL.

         __________        !:EXIT<RET>              Cause OPSER to exit to the monitor.

   The example above shows how to log in a subjob, give it a name, run  a
   system  program,  and log out the subjob.  Once the concept of subjobs
   is understood, it is  simple  to  give  system  commands  and  program
   commands  to  a  subjob.   The  entire  range  of  monitor and program
   commands can be sent to a subjob as long as the command is preceded by
   a  subjob  name  or  number  followed  by a hyphen.  This becomes very
   important in explaining the  service  programs  which  are  run  under
   OPSER.

   To <CTRL/C> a subjob, a <CTRL/A> must be used, since a <CTRL/C>  under
   OPSER  is  equivalent  to  :EXIT.  For example, to <CTRL/C> subjob FIL
   which is running PIP, the command is:

         __________        !FIL-A<RET>
              !
           ________           <CTRL/A>

   Whatever was being done under PIP would be allowed to finish, and  the
   subjob FIL would be put at monitor level.

   A useful feature of OPSER is the ability to  automatically  execute  a
   predefined set of commands contained in a disk file.  This is known as
   the AUTO feature  of  OPSER.   For  example,  consider  the  following
   sequence of commands:

        _____ __________        :SLOG 2,167<RET>
        ____ _________        :DEF FIL=<RET>
        _____ ________        :WHAT FIL<RET>
        _____ ________        FIL-R PIP<RET>
        _______________________________        FILC.EXT=FILA.EXT,FILB.EXT<RET>
        _____ ________        :STOP FIL<RET>
        _____ ________        :KJOB FIL<RET>

   If the above commands were placed in a file named FIL.ATO,  you  could
   accomplish  exactly  what  was  done  manually in the example above by
   entering the single OPSER command:

        _____ ________        :AUTO FIL<RET>

   Commands included in a file named OPR.ATO are  automatically  executed
   whenever the system is loaded.

   OPSER is used to control a large part  of  system  operation.   It  is
   important that you become proficient in its use.

        :KSYS hh:mm         Stops timesharing at the  time  specified  by
        :KSYS +hh:mm        hh:mm.  This must  be at  least  five minutes
        :KSYS               later than the current time.   If  +hh:mm  is
                            used,  it  means  the  number of hours and/or
                            minutes from the current time and must be  at
                            least  five  minutes.   All  users logging in
                            receive a message stating the time  at  which
                            timesharing   will   end.    Logged-in  users
                            receive  similar  messages  when  the   :KSYS
                            command is given, one hour before timesharing
                            ends, then at 30, 15, 8, 4, 2, and 1  minutes
                            before timesharing is scheduled to stop.  The
                            messages are of the form:   TIMESHARING  ENDS
                            IN  n  MIN.  :KSYS works only for a [1,2] job
                            running at the OPR terminal.

                            Note that :KSYS without  an  argument  undoes
                            the effect of :KSYS hh:mm or :KSYS +hh:mm.

                            The  colon  in  the  time  specification   is
                            optional; both hh:mm and hhmm are valid.

        :RESTRICT dev:,...  restricts  the  specified  devices   to   the
                            operator's  use.  The operator can assign the
                            devices  to  a  user,  but  the  user  cannot
                            reassign them to anyone but the operator.

        :SET BATMAX n       sets the maximum number  (n)  of  batch  jobs

                            In the above commands, "filespec" stands  for
                            file  specification and consists of a device,
                            file name, file extension,  and  a  directory
                            name in the form:

                                 dev:   is any valid input  device  name.
                                        The default is DSK:.

                                 file   stands for any 1- to  6-character
                                        file  name.  There is no default.
                                        You must supply a file name.

                                 .ext   is any  1-  to  3-character  file
                                        name  extension.   The default is

                                 [PPN]  is  the   directory   area   that
                                        contains  the  file.  The default

                            new one.  (The disk log file is a transaction
                            file where OPSER logs its activities.)

        :CONTINUE           continues  processing  the  AUTO  file  after

                            during AUTO file processing.

        :CURRENT            types the name of the current subjob  if  one
                            has been defined; if a current subjob has not

                            any) must be alphanumeric.  The  subjob  name
                            "B"  is  reserved  as the mnemonic for BATCON
                            and should  not  be  assigned  to  any  other
                            subjob.

        :DEVICE dev:log:n   causes OPSER to exit to  the  monitor,  where

                            (n) and also associate a logical  name  (log)
                            with   that  device.   The  logical  name  is
                            optional, but if you omit it, you  must  tell
                            OPSER.   You  do  this  by typing a colon (:)
                            where the logical name would  have  appeared,
                            for example, :DEVICE MTB: :4.  If you issue a
                            .REENTER command before returning  to  OPSER,
                            you will abort the .ASSIGN command.  When you
                            are ready to return to OPSER, type :CONT.

        :ERROR n,m,...      silences all  output  except  error  messages
                            from  subjobs  n,m,  and  so on.  The :REVIVE
                            command will resume reporting  all  messages.
                            When  OPSER  is  first started, :REVIVE is in
                            effect.

        :EXIT or <CTRL/C>   exits  to  the  monitor  if  no  subjobs  are
                            active.

        :FREE               types the number of the first unused subjob.

        :HELP               types a text briefly explaining the  commands
                            and their formats.

        :KILL n,m,...       see :KJOB.

        :KJOB n,m,...       logs out the specified subjobs n, m,  and  so
                            on,  saving  all  their  files.  Also, the /Z
                            switch is passed to the KJOB program in order
                            to   suppress  the  normal  queuing  done  at
                            log-out time.

                            :WHAT command.  If n equals 0, the job status
                            bits  are included in the :WHAT output.  If n

        :QUEUE line         initiates the first free subjob and sends the
                            line as a QUEUE command to the monitor.

        :RESOURCES          lists the available system resources.

                            m, and so on, and causes  normal  echoing  or
                            output   from  them.   When  OPSER  is  first
                            started, the :REVIVE command is in effect.

   5.4  OPSER OPERATOR MESSAGES   5.4  OPSER OPERATOR MESSAGES

   The  following  messages  from  OPSER  can  appear  on  your  operator
   terminal.


   ?OPRATE Auto file read error

        OPSER encountered a read error while it was trying to process the
        auto file.


   ?OPRANI Device cannot do input

        Input cannot be performed on the specified device, either because
        it is not a valid device name, or because it is a device that can
        only do output.


   ?OPRBFS Bad file spec

        There is a syntax error in the file specification.


   ?OPRBTS Bad time specified

        There is a syntax error in the time specification.   See  Section
        5.2.1 for information about the format of the OPSER commands.


   ?OPRCKJ Cannot be KJOB'ed

        OPSER is unable to log the job out.  One cause of this  condition
        is a job being over quota.


   ?OPRCMM Cannot be put in monitor mode

        The operator  attempted  to  return  to  the  monitor  (:EXIT  or
        <CTRL/C>  but was unable to do so even after several tries.  This
        condition indicates a system or a program problem.


   ?OPRCNU Command not unique

        The operator has entered an abbreviation that does not specify  a
        unique command.

   ?OPRCUA Cannot use all

        The operator typed a command with "ALL" as the argument.  Certain
        commands  do  not  accept  "ALL"  as  an  argument  (for example,
        :DEFINE).  Refer to Section 5.2.1 for information about the OPSER
        operator commands.


   ?OPRDCO Device cannot do output

        The device specified in  the  :TLOG  command  is  not  an  output
        device.


   %OPRDNR DAEMON not running

        The DAEMON program has not been initialized.


   ?OPRDUE DAEMON UUO error

        An error occurred when OPSER  called  DAEMON  to  do  accounting.
        Consult the system administrator.


   %OPRFMM :KSYS has a minimum of 5 min.

        The operator specified an argument that was  too  small  for  the
        :KSYS  command.   The  value  of the "+hh:mm" form of the command
        must be +00:05 or greater.   The  value  of  hh:mm  form  of  the
        command  must  be  at least five minutes later than current time.
        See Section 5.3.1 for details about the format of this command.


   ?OPRJNA No job number assigned

        This message generally occurs in response to the  :WHAT  command.
        It  happens  in  cases  where the monitor does not know about the
        subjob specified in the command.


   ?OPRJRO Job(s) running on n,m,...
        Type ":Kill all" to kill the subjobs

        The operator tried to :EXIT or <CTRL/C> from OPSER  from  subjobs
        n,m, and so on were active.  The subjos must be killed first.


   ?OPRLEF Enter failure code on log file

        An  enter  failure  occurred  when  OPSER  tried  to   open   the
        transaction log file (:TLOG).

   ?OPRNAS No active subjobs

        The operator issued a command to a subjob  but  no  subjobs  were
        running.


   ?OPRNFP No free PTY's

        There are no more pseudo-terminals (PTYs) available  under  which
        to run subjobs.


   ?OPRNFS No free subjobs

        This message occurs in response to either the :FREE command or  a
        command  that  uses  a  free subjob (such as :QUEUE).  It happens
        when there are no free subjobs available.


   ?OPRNSM No such mnemonic

        The name specified in the command is not associated with  any  of
        the  subjobs.  This is either because it was typed incorrectly or
        because the name had not previously been associated with a subjob
        by means of the :DEFINE command.


   [OPRPAF Processing auto command file]

        OPSER is currently processing the auto file.


   ?OPRSJW  Is stuck with JACCT on

        The operator tried to return to the monitor (:EXIT  or  <CTRL/C>)
        but  was  unable  to  do  so,  even  after  several  tries.  This
        condition indicates a system or program problem.


   ?OPRSNA Subjob n is not active

        A command was given to subjob n and that subjob is not active.


   %OPRSPR superseding previous :AUTO request

        The operator issued another  :AUTO  command.   This  new  command
        supersedes the one previously issued.

   This appendix lists error messages you may encounter while using  OPR,
   as well as the reason for the error and recovery procedures.


   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous

   Reason:        You issued an OPR command, but  did  not  complete  it.
                  For  example,  you  may  have  left  out  the necessary
                  keyword or switch that would make the  command  execute
                  properly.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the necessary keyword or switch.


   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous switch or keyword

   Reason:        Same as above.

   Recovery:      Same as above.


   ERROR:         ?  CONFIRMATION Required

   Reason:        You gave a command but the command syntax is not valid.

   Recovery:      Check the command to  see  if  you  have  provided  all
                  necessary  keywords, arguments, and/or switches.  Check
                  that the hardware is available or that  the  device  is
                  ready  for  use.   Then  give  the command again.  (See
                  Chapter 2 for the commands correct keywords,  arguments
                  and switches.)

   ERROR:         ?  Device Name name:  Does Not Exist

   Reason:        You specified a device name (name:) in an  OPR  command
                  that  is  currently not recognized by the system.  Such
                  devices are tape drives or disk drives.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype  the  command  and  specify  a
                  device  name  that  the  system acknowledges.  Give the
                  SHOW STATUS command to  find  those  devices  that  the
                  system recognizes.


   ERROR:         ?  Does not match switch or keyword

   Reason:        You specified a switch or keyword for  an  OPR  command
                  that can not take the switch or keyword specified.

   Recovery:      Type the command again and then specify a valid  switch
                  or keyword for that command.


   ERROR:         ?  Filename was not specified

   Reason:        You  specified  an  OPR  command  that  takes  a   file
                  specification  as  a  keyword or value to a switch, but
                  did not specify the file name.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the file name.


   ERROR:         ?  File not found

   Reason:        You  specified  an  OPR  command  that  takes  a   file
                  specification  as  a  keyword or value to a switch, but
                  the file was not found.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the correct file specification.


   ERROR:         ?  First nonspace character is not a digit

   Reason:        You specified a keyword or switch value  that  must  be
                  numeric,  but the first character is alphabetic or is a
                  special character.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and then specify a
                  numeric  keyword  or  switch  value  with  any  numeric
                  characters.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the device name with the correct characters and include
                  the colon (:).


   ERROR:         ?  Invalid HELP command specified

   Reason:        You specified an invalid OPR command as  a  keyword  to
                  the HELP command.

   Recovery:      Give the HELP HELP command  to  get  a  list  of  valid

   ERROR:         ?  Invalid guide word

   Reason:        You specified a guide word that does not pertain to the
                  OPR  command  that  you  specified,  you misspelled the
                  guide word, or you  used  recognition  and  then  typed
                  <CTRL/H> before you pressed <RET>.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command.  If you must have
                  guide  words with the OPR command, use recognition with
                  the ESCape key.


   ERROR:         ?  Invalid node name

   Reason:        You specified a node name or number to the /NODE switch
                  for  a  node that has not been enabled, does not exist,
                  or has been misspelled.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the  correct  node  name or number to the /NODE switch.
                  You might have to ENABLE the node  before  you  reissue

   Reason:        You specified a node name or number in an OPR  command,
                  but did not specify the double colon (::) at the end of
                  the name.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command  and  include  the
                  two  colons.   Some  OPR  commands will provide the two
                  colons after the name  or  number,  if  you  press  the
                  ESCape key after typing the node name.


   ERROR:         ?  Invalid OPR command specified

   Reason:        You specified an invalid OPR command.

   Recovery:      Type a question mark to the OPR prompt to get a list of
                  valid OPR commands.


   ERROR:         ?  Invalid token found

   Reason:        You specified an OPR command, such as HOLD or  RELEASE,
                  but  did  not give one of the necessary arguments.  The
                  necessary  arguments  are  the  request-id-number,  the
                  project-programmer number, or an asterisk.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and include one of
                  the required arguments to the command.


   ERROR:         ?  Invalid wildcard designator

   Reason:        You specified a wildcard character (* or  %)  within  a
                  file specification for a keyword or switch value.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the file specification without any wildcard characters.
                  OPR/ORION does not accept wildcard characters within  a
                  file specification.


   ERROR:         ?  Negative number improper

   Reason:        You specified a negative number for a device or  stream
                  number.  OPR does not accept negative numbers.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and then specify a
                  positive integer as a device or stream number.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify

   Reason:        You specified a file type as a keyword or switch value,

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify

   ERROR:         ?  Not a quoted string - does  not  begin  with  double

   Reason:        You specified a message text, but did  not  include  it
                  within double quotes ("message text").

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the message text within the required double quotes.


   ERROR:         ?  Not confirmed

   Reason:        You specified too many keywords or switches to  an  OPR
                  command.   OPR  expected a carriage return after one of
                  the keywords or switches specified.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>; OPR retypes the command up to the  point
                  where carriage return is expected.  Then press <RET>.


   ERROR:         ?  Only one file allowed

   Reason:        You specified the  BACKSPACE  or  FORWARDSPACE  command
                  with  the  /FILE  switch  and  a  numeric value greater
                  than 1.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>; OPR retypes the command up to the  point
                  where  you  entered  the number of files.  You can then
                  enter 1 or press <RET> .   The  /FILE  switch  defaults

   Reason:        You  specified  too   many   characters   in   a   name
                  specification  to the /NODE switch.  The /NODE name can
                  have only from one to six alphanumeric characters.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command and  then  specify
                  the  correct  node name for the /NODE switch.  The name
                  must be six characters or less.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the command  and  then  supply
                  the two colons at the end of the node name/number.


   ERROR:         ?  Value missing in date/time

   Reason:        You specified an OPR command that requires an  argument
                  of date and/or time, such as the SET USAGE command.

   Recovery:      Type <CTRL/H>, or retype the  command  and  supply  the
