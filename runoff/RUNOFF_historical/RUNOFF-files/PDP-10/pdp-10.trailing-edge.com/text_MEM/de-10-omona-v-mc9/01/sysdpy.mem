Summary

This release updates SYSDPY to increase its  reporting  facilities  to
support  the  5.07  Monitor.   An  effort has been made to improve the
performance of SYSDPY.  The improvement has been reached by:

     1.  Using tables in the SPY segment directly.

     2.  Replacing all  unnecessary  PEEK  and  GETTAB  UUO's  by  SPY
         operations.
