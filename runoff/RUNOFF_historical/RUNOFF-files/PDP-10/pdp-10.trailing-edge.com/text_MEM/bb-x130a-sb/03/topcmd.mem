                                 NOTE

This publication was originally created for those customers  who  were
converting  from  a  TOPS-10 system to a TOPS-20 system.  The title of
the publication and the organization of material was designed to  meet
that objective.  Customers at 1983 Fall DECUS who saw this publication
requested DIGITAL to release it to all TOPS-10  customers  because  it
contains  useful  information  for  those  not  converting to TOPS-20.
Because of the number of customer requests, we are  distributing  this
publication  as part of the TOPS-10 customer supported tape.  There is
no commitment on DIGITAL's part to upgrade this material  with  future
releases nor to respond to requests for enhancements or corrections.

The  TOPS-10/TOPS-20  COMMANDS  QUICK  REFERENCE   GUIDE   lists,   in     TOPS-10/TOPS-20  COMMANDS  QUICK  REFERENCE   GUIDE
alphabetical order, all TOPS-10 operating system commands available to
the user and comparable TOPS-20 commands.   Each  command  description
contains the command name followed by its function.  Where TOPS-10 and
TOPS-20 commands are  identical,  they  are  together  with  a  single
functional  description.   TOPS-10  monitor  level and TOPS-20 command
level are considered to be equivalent in  the  function  descriptions.
All  TOPS-20  commands  not  comparable  to available TOPS-10 commands
appear with their function descriptions  in  the  "Additional  TOPS-20
Commands" section of this guide.

Various TOPS-20 commands accept subcommands, switches, and  arguments.
To  enter  subcommand  level, type a comma before you press the RETURN
key.  You are at subcommand level when you see the prompt @@.

You terminate all command strings by  pressing  the  RETURN  key.   In
addition,  TOPS-20 commands provide Command Recognition when you press
the ESCAPE key.  On TOPS-10, the  ESCAPE  key  is  equivalent  to  the
RETURN key.

You can use wildcard characters  in  TOPS-10  file  specifications  to
specify  groups  of  files,  in  project-programmer numbers to specify
groups of PPN's, and in names of directories to  represent  groups  of
directories.  You cannot use wildcard characters in device names.  The
asterisk (*) wildcard takes the place of a group of  characters.   The
question mark (?) wildcard takes the place of a single character.  You
cannot use the characters * and ?  together in the same field.

In TOPS-20 you can include wildcard characters in any field of a  file
specification,  to  access  all  files  matching  the rest of the file
specification.  An  asterisk  (*)  takes  the  place  of  a  group  of
characters,  while  a percent sign (%) fills in for a single character
only.  You cannot use the characters * and  %  together  in  the  same
field.

For complete information on TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 commands, refer to the
respective operating system commands manual.

                            TOPS-10/TOPS-20 COMMANDS




.ASSIGN node-id_dev:logical-name

Allocates  an  unrestricted  device  to  your  job  without   operator
intervention  and assigns the logical name to the device.  The node-id
allows you to specify  a  device  from  another  node  in  the  system
network.   The  node-id and the logical name are optional parts of the
command line.


@ASSIGN (DEVICE) dev:

Assigns exclusive control of a specific device for your job.




.ATTACH jobn [PPN]
PASSWORD:password

Detaches your terminal from your current job (if you  are  logged  in)
and  attaches  your  terminal  to  the  specified job.  The job number
(jobn) is required.  The project-programmer number [PPN]  is  required
if  you  are  detaching a job that has a different PPN from the job to
which you are attaching, or if you are not logged in when you type the
ATTACH command.


@ATTACH (USER) user name (JOB#) job number
PASSWORD:password

Attaches your terminal to a job.  If you give the ATTACH command while
logged  in,  your  current  job is detached.  You can use the LOGOUT n
command to log out this detached job.




.BACKSPACE MTxnnu:n {FILES or RECORDS}


@BACKSPACE (DEVICE) dev:  n {FILES or RECORDS}

n is the number of files or records over which you want to backspace

Moves magnetic  tape  backwards  the  specified  number  of  files  or
records.



                                       5



.CCONTINUE


@CONTINUE (PROGRAM) STAY

Resumes execution of a program that is halted and keeps your  terminal
at monitor/command level.




.CLOSE dev:

Terminates I/O on the specified  device,  but  does  not  release  the
device  from  your  job.  If you omit the device name, I/O ends on all
devices assigned to your job except your terminal and disk.


@CLOSE (JFN) n

Closes files in your job and releases their JFNs (Job File Numbers).

.COMPILE filespec(a,b,c)/switches,filespec/switches,...


@COMPILE (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...

Runs one or more language processors to  translate  source  code  into
object  code.   For  TOPS-10,  if  you omit the file specification and
switches, the system uses the  arguments  specified  in  any  previous
COMPILE-class  command.  Use the optional (a,b,c) construction to pass
switches to the compiler or assembler.  (Refer to Appendix C,  TOPS-10
Operating System Commands Manual.)

.CONTINUE


@CONTINUE (PROGRAM) NORMALLY

Resumes execution of a  program  that  is  halted  and  restores  your
terminal to user level.




.COPY new-filespec=old-filespec-1,old-filespec-2,...

Copies files from one device or directory to another.  If you omit the
new file name, the new file is written to your directory on DSK:.  The
new file will have the same file name and extension as  the  old  file
and also the default protection code.


@COPY (FROM) source filespec list (TO) destination filespec,
@@subcommand

Copies files from one device or directory to another.  If you omit the
destination  filespec,  the  new file will have the same file name and
extension as  the  old  file  but  in  your  connected  directory,  if
necessary using the next higher generation number.

Subcommands:

     ASCII(20)          BINARY(20)
     BYTE(20)           IMAGE-MODE(20)




.CORE memory

Changes the amount of memory assigned to your job.  If  you  omit  the
argument,  the monitor displays your current memory assignment on your
terminal.


There is no comparable TOPS-20 command.











                                       8



.CPUNCH job=filespec/switches,filespec/switches,...

Makes entries in the card punch output queue.  If you omit  job=,  the
default is the name of the first file in the request.  To see the jobs
in the card punch queue, use the CPUNCH command with no  arguments  or
switches.   To  create  a file containing the names of the jobs in the
queue, type the output file name instead of the job name, and use  the
/LIST switch.


@PUNCH (ONTO) CARD (FILES) /switch(es) filespec/switch(es),...

Makes entries in the card punch output queue.   File  switches  placed
before  all  files  in  the  command  line  act  as  defaults for all;
otherwise they affect only the nearest preceding file.  To see a  list
of jobs in the TOPS-20 card punch queue, use:
INFORMATION (ABOUT) OUTPUT-REQUESTS.

Switches:

                                          9



.CREF filespec

Prints the cross-referenced listing file generated for  the  specified
file  by a previous COMPILE-class command containing the /CREF switch.
If you omit the file specification, the system uses the file specified
in the previous COMPILE-class command, (if any).  If you type the file
name but omit the file extension, the default is .CRF.


@CREF destination filespec=source filename

Runs the CREF program, which  produces  a  cross-reference  listing(s)
from  files  of type .CRF.  If you have files of type .CRF produced by
LOAD-class  commands  during  the  current   terminal   session,   the
unmodified  command  CREF  produces  listings  of them and deletes the
files.  By supplying an argument, you  can  copy  the  listing  for  a
current .CRF file to another file or device.

Switches:

     1A(20)   1B(20)   1C(20)   1D(20)  1H(20)
     1K(20)   1M(20)   1O(20)   1P(20)  1R(20)
     1S(20)   1W(20)   1Z(20)




.CSTART addr

Begins execution of a program at the specified address and leaves your
terminal  at  monitor  level.   If  you  omit  the  address  argument,
execution starts at the beginning of the program.


For the comparable TOPS-20 command,  see  the  TOPS-20  START  command
listed under .START.


















                                         10



.D lh rh addr

Modifies the contents of a specific memory location.  The arguments in
octal  are  placed in the left half(lh) and the right half (rh) of the
word.  You must specify both the left and right halves.  If  you  omit
the  address  argument,  the  values  are  deposited  in  the  address
specified in a previous E  command,  or  in  the  location  after  the
address  specified in a previous D command.  The address is taken from
the D or E command used most recently.


@DEPOSIT (MEMORY LOCATION) octal address (CONTENTS) octal number

Modifies the contents of a specific memory location.  If you omit  the
address argument, the values are deposited in the address specified by
your most recent EXAMINE command.  You must press the  ESCAPE  key  to
take this default.




.DAYTIME


@DAYTIME

Displays today's date and the time on  your  terminal.   TOPS-20  also
displays the day of the week.




.DCORE filespec

Writes a core dump of your memory without changing the state  of  your
memory  area.   If  you  omit  the  file specification, the default is
DSK:nnnDAE.TMP, where nnn is your job number.


There is no comparable TOPS-20 command for the unprivileged user.














                                         11



.DDT

Starts execution of the currently loaded  debugging  program.   If  no
debugger is currently loaded, this command loads and starts VMDDT.


@DDT/switch

Loads or merges a debugging program and then starts your program.

Switch:

     /USE-SECTION(20)




.DEASSIGN dev:


@DEASSIGN (DEVICE) dev:

Releases the device from  your  job  and  places  the  device  in  the
system's pool of available resources.

.DEBUG filespec/switches,filespec/switches,...


@DEBUG (FROM) /switch(es) source/switch(es) object,...

Loads and starts your program with an appropriate  debugging  program.
For  TOPS-10,  if  you  omit  the file specification and switches, the
system uses  the  arguments  specified  in  a  previous  COMPILE-class
command,  (if  any).   For  TOPS-20, if you omit the source and object
filespecs, the system  uses  the  filespecs  and  associated  switches
specified in a previous LOAD-class command.

.PROTECT filespec<nnn>,filespec<nnn>,...

Assigns the specified protection codes to the specified files.   Every
file  has a protection code.  The code tells who can and cannot access
the file.  The protection code consists of three octal  digits.   Each
digit  specifies  the  amount  of protection against a group of users.
The first (leftmost) digit is the protection code for the owner of the
file;   the  middle  digit is the protection code for all users having
the same project number as the file owner;  the last (rightmost) digit
is the protection code for all other users.
