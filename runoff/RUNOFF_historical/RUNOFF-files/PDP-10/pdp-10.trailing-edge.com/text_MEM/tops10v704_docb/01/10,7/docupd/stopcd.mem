                        MONITOR STOPCODE DEFINITION


   1  MONITOR STOPCODE DEFINITION   1  MONITOR STOPCODE DEFINITION

   A stopcode message is generated when the  monitor  detects  a  serious
   error  in  its  database.   When  the  TOPS-10  monitor  encounters an
   internal error it issues a one to six character name called a stopcode
   name.   The  stopcode  is  displayed on the console terminal (CTY) and
   alerts you of possible system failure, depending on  the  severity  of
   the error.  The stopcode message is generated by a stopcode macro when
   the monitor detects an error in the database.  This macro  prints  the
   following message on the CTY:

                  ______       ____       _    _________        ?Stopcode xxxyyy, Type=type on CPUn at date/time

   Where:

        ______        xxxyyy    is the stopcode name.

        ____        type      is the type of stopcode.   Stopcode  types  are  listed
                  below.

        _        n         is the CPU number.

        _________        date/time is the date and time of day when the stopcode occurred.



   2  TYPES OF STOPCODES   2  TYPES OF STOPCODES

   The stopcodes are divided into categories, depending on  the  severity
   of  the  error that cause the stopcode, and the portions of the system
   that might be affected by the error.  The types of  monitor  stopcodes
   are:

        1.  DEBUG stopcodes indicate internal  errors  only.   These  are
            continuable stopcodes.

        2.  JOB stopcodes indicate that the error  may  endanger  a  user
            job.  These are continuable stopcodes.  Only the job that was
            running when the stopcode occurred will be stopped.

        3.  STOP stopcodes indicate errors  that  might  endanger  system
            operation.  These are not continuable stopcodes.

        4.  CPU  stopcodes  indicate  errors   that   prevent   continued
            operation of a CPU.  In a single-CPU configuration, or if the
            CPU that encountered the stopcode was the only CPU running at
            the  time, the CPU stopcode is equivalent to a STOP stopcode.
            If there are other CPUs running in an  SMP  configuration  at
            the  time  of  the stopcode, a dump is taken and the affected
            CPU halts.  Any job that was running on the affected  CPU  at
            the time of the stopcode is stopped.

                        MONITOR STOPCODE DEFINITION


        5.  HALT stopcodes indicate fatal errors that  halt  the  system,
            and, by definition, are not continuable.

        6.  INFO stopcodes are continuable stopcodes that  are  generated
            to inform the system operator of a system event.

   The monitor generates a stopcode using the STOPCD  macro.   There  are
   several  modules  in the monitor, however, that use the BUG.  macro to
   generate a stopcode.  These modules are common  to  both  TOPS-10  and
   TOPS-20.   They  generate  three  types  of BUG.  stopcodes, which are
   equivalent to the following types of stopcodes:

        ____ ____      ______ ____        BUG. Type      STOPCD Type

        HLT            STOP
        CHK            DEBUG
        INF            INFO



   2.1  DEBUG Stopcodes   2.1  DEBUG Stopcodes

   A DEBUG stopcode is a stopcode that is not immediately harmful to  any
   job  or  to the system.  When the monitor encounters an internal error
   at the interrupt level, a dump is performed and processing  continues.
   The  following  message  is  printed  on  the  CTY  after the stopcode
   notification:

        [Continuing system]



   2.2  JOB Stopcodes   2.2  JOB Stopcodes

   A  JOB  stopcode  indicates  that  an  internal  error  endangers  the
   integrity  of  the  job that is currently running.  The monitor aborts
   the current job and continues processing.

   The following message  is  printed  on  the  CTY  after  the  stopcode
   notification:

        [Aborting job]

   On the user's terminal, the following message is displayed:

                                         _______        ?Monitor error at {user/exec} PC nnnnnn;
                              ______        UUO at {user/exec} PC mmmmmm

   Where:

        ______      ______        nnnnnn and  mmmmmm  are  one  of  the  following  virtual  memory
        locations:


                                     2
                        MONITOR STOPCODE DEFINITION

         o  Exec location nnnnnn; Exec called from exec location mmmmmm

         o  Exec location nnnnnn; Exec called from user location mmmmmm



   2.3  STOP Stopcodes   2.3  STOP Stopcodes

   A STOP  stopcode  indicates  an  internal  error  that  endangers  the
   integrity  of  the entire system.  All jobs are aborted and the system
   begins to dump and reload  the  monitor  automatically.   The  monitor
   prints   the   following   message  on  the  CTY  after  the  stopcode
   notification:

        Reload monitor

   If  the  monitor  obtains  the  necessary  information,  it  prints  a
   supplementary message on the CTY of the form:

            ____       ___         ____        JOB jobn on TTYnnn running name
               _____ ______________            _______        UUO is octal representation at user PC address
             ________        File filespec

   Where:

        ____        jobn                is the number of the job causing the error.

        ___        nnn                 is the number  of  the  job  controlling  the
                            terminal.

        ____        name                is the name of the program running  for  that

   2.4  CPU Stopcodes   2.4  CPU Stopcodes

   A CPU stopcode is handled differently, depending on the number of CPUs
   in  the  configuration  running  at  the  time  of  the  crash.  For a
   single-CPU system, a CPU stopcode  has  the  same  effect  as  a  STOP
   stopcode.  When a CPU stopcode occurs on the only processor running in
   a multiprocessor (SMP) system, the  effect  is  the  same  as  a  STOP
   stopcode.  All user jobs are aborted and the system begins to dump and
   reload the monitor automatically.  The following message is printed on
   the  CTY  of  the CPU that experienced the failure, after the stopcode
   notification:

        Reload monitor

   However, in a SMP system where more than one CPU  is  running  at  the
   time  of  the  stopcode,  the  CPU  stopcode  aborts the job currently
   running, a dump is taken, and the CPU that  encountered  the  stopcode
   halts.

   For SMP systems in which more that one CPU is running,  the  following
   message  is  displayed  on  the  CTY  for the CPU that encountered the
   stopcode:

        [Stopping CPU]

   If  the  monitor  obtains  the  necessary  information,  it  prints  a
   supplementary message on the CTY of the form:

            ____       ___         ____        Job jobn on TTYnnn running name
               _____ ______________            _______        UUO is octal representation at user PC address
             ________        File filespec

   Where:

        ____        jobn                is the number of the job causing the error.

        ___        nnn                 is the number  of  the  job  controlling  the
                            terminal.

        ____        name                is the name of the program running  for  that

   2.5  HALT Stopcodes   2.5  HALT Stopcodes

   A HALT stopcode indicates a fatal error and affects the entire system.
   The  monitor  cannot  automatically reload.  The system halts, and you
                                                                  _______   must manually dump and reload the  monitor.   (Refer  to  the  TOPS-10
   __________ _____   Operator's Guide.)

   HALT stopcodes generate the following message:

        KL HALTED



   2.6  INFO Stopcodes   2.6  INFO Stopcodes

   An INFO stopcode is a report on a system event that may be of interest
   in  debugging crashes.  These stopcodes are for informational purposes
   only, and do not interrupt system or job execution.



   3  CONTINUABLE STOPCODES   3  CONTINUABLE STOPCODES

   Continuable stopcodes occur when the monitor executes a STOPCD  macro,
   dumps  the memory image, and continues the system automatically.  HALT
   and STOP stopcodes are not continuable.  A CPU stopcode is continuable
   on SMP systems where more than one CPU is running (see Section 2.4).

   The following examples illustrate three  continuable  DEBUG  stopcodes
   and a JOB stopcode, as displayed on the CTY:

                            the stack is probably returning  a  block  to
                            the  wrong  free  list,  or  is  returning an

                            command  in  the  CONFIG file was higher than
                            the DECNET MAXIMUM-ADDRESS value set  in  the
                            same  file.   As  a consequence DECnet cannot
                            initialize.

                            Change the startup file to be consistent.


   COMCAW  D36COM   CHK     Core Allocation Wrong


   COMCHA  D36COM   CHK     Number of available FB blocks to large

                            When checking the CH begstr  for  a  type  of
                            block,  the  code determined that more blocks
                            were available than  there  were  originally.
                            DNCHFB  is  supposed  to defend against this.
                            CHNUM was probably trashed.


   COMCHB  D36COM   CHK     CH pointer off by a few

                            A pointer internal  to  the  core  management
                            routines  is  off  by  a few words.  You have
                            probably trashed an AC by  adding  to  it  or
                            XORing some bits.


   COMCHO  D36COM   CHK     CH pointer Out of range

                            In the  core  block  checking  routines,  the
                            internal pointer to the CH begstr applying to
                            this type of block is bad.   Your  executable
                            code was probably trashed.

                            why it takes a non-skip return.

                            In range checking the  ac  MS,  its  contents
                            were  outside the range of addresses used for
                            the MS block.  Trace back to the  caller  and
                            find out why it has a junk pointer.

   COMFBA  D36COM   CHK     FB Available count is wrong

                            DNCHFB walked through a free list and found a
                            different  number  of blocks on the list than
                            the header indicated.  A forward pointer  was
                            probably  destroyed  in a previously returned
                            block.


   COMFBB  D36COM   CHK     FB in database is off by a few

                            DNCHFB found a block on  a  free  list,  most
                            likely just returned, whose address is not on
                            a block boundary  for  blocks  on  this  free
                            list.   The  offending  pointer  is in P1.  A
                            caller on the stack is probably  returning  a
                            junk  pointer,  either  a  real  pointer to a
                            block   that   has   been   incremented    or
                            decremented, or a completely junk pointer.


   COMFBF  D36COM   CHK     FB is already on Free list

                            The block that P1 points to is already on the
                            free  list  and  is  being returned again.  A
                            caller on the stack is returning a block that
                            is already free.


   COMFBO  D36COM   HLT     FB pointer is Out of range

                            When checking a free block pointer, the  code
                            found that the pointer is not pointing to the
                            free core allocated for this type  of  block.
                            Identify   the  routine  that  supplied  this
                            pointer.


   COMFBT  D36COM   HLT     FB pointer is off by a few

                            The  user  of  this  pointer probably added a
                            constant,  and  forgot  to  restore  it  when
                            returning  the block.  Trace the user of this
                            pointer, and make sure the pointer  is  valid
                            when given to the memory manager.

   COMIEL  D36COM   CHK     Illegal End of List pointer

                            CHAVL, the available count, said there was at
                            least  one  block  on  the free list, but the
                            first pointer was zero.   A  forward  pointer
                            was   probably   destroyed  in  a  previously
                            returned block.

                            core  pool  starts, is zero.  This field gets
                            set when the core manager is initialized.  If
                            DNINIM has already been called, check to make
                            sure it is initializing all CH blocks.


   COMMMS  D36COM   HLT     Bad pointer passed to Memory Manager

                            When DNGWDS gives out a  block  of  core,  it
                            leaves  a  check  word immediately before the
                            first word of core given to the  user.   This
                            word  contains the length of the block, and a
                            "check" quantity to verify  that  this  block
                            contains  what  is  expected.  This bug means
                            that the check word has been trashed, or  the
                            pointer that was passed to the memory manager
                            is bad.

   NTBSUP  D36COM   CHK     Buffer SUPplied

                            The routine NTPARM was  called  to  handle  a
                            network  management  parameter.   The routine
                            can only handle returns of  a  single  value,
                            but NTMAN had supplied a multi-word buffer.


   NTBTSM  D36COM   CHK     Buffer Too SMall

                            NTMAN requested a show counter operation, but
                            did not supply a buffer large enough to store
                            all the counters.


   NTMBCF  NTMAN    CHK     Bad Coded Field on output

                            While  formatting  output  for  a  SHOW,  the
                            program  was  requested  to  generate a Coded
                            field of more than one byte.  The program  is
                            not  coded  for  this  function.  Look at the
                            descriptor block pointed to by NT.  Check  to
                            see if this item is supposed to be a multiple
                            byte Coded.  If not, fix  the  item's  entry.
                            If  it  is  correct, write the code to handle
                            multiple-byte Coded fields.

                            reading  a  value  from  the user string, the
                            descriptor tables returned an invalid  format
                            for  this  item.   The  AC  NT  points to the
                            descriptor for this  item,  and  field  NTSEQ
                            should  tell  which item is being referenced.

   NTMCNO  NTMAN    HLT     Circuit Name Overrun

                            More than 16 bytes of data were returned to a
                            16  byte  field.   The data beyond the buffer
                            was trashed.  Examine the algorithm at NMXC2N
                            to determine why the code returned more bytes
                            than were expected.  To avoid this halt,  fix
                            the  above code to check for overrun while it
                            is producing the bytes.


   NTMDVI  NTMAN    CHK     NMXDSP Value Illegal

                            The code called a layer to obtain a value  or
                            set  a  value for an item.  The routine value
                            in the descriptor block pointed to by NT  was
                            illegal.   Examine the data structure pointed
                            to by NT.  Probably  this  was  caused  by  a
                            trashed   NT,   since  the  descriptor  block
                            generation macros are supposed to range check
                            this value.

                            to NMXEVT was out of range.

                            Make callers of  NMXEVT  supply  the  correct

                            dispatching  on  it,  the code found the type
                            value was illegal.  Since the value  supplied
                            by  the user is checked at GETBLK, this means

                            NTMAN.   The  most likely cause of this error
                            is a trashed AC.

   6  GALAXY-10 STOPCODES   6  GALAXY-10 STOPCODES

   An alphabetical list of the GALAXY-10 stopcodes  is  provided  in  the
   following  section.   The  list  shows  the name of each stopcode, the
   module in which it is found, the stopcode message (for which the  name
   is a mnemonic), and an explanation.

   Each GALAXY component is made up  of  one  or  more  modules,  thus  a
   stopcode  can  be generated by a module with a name other than that of
   the component producing the stopcode.

   When GALAXY encounters an internal error, a stopcode is generated.   A
   message containing the stopcode, the stopcode message, the location of
   the  error,  the  module  name  where  the  error  occurred,  and   an
   explanation  of  the  error (if available) will appear in the operator
   log file.  The following example shows the form of the message sent to
   the operator log file:

                ______   _______               ________   ? Stopcode - XXXxxx - message at PC <pc> in location
