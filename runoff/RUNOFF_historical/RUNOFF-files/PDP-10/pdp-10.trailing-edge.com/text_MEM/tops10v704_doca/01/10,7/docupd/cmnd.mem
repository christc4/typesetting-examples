                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION



   TOPS-10 is the name of the Timesharing Operating  System  for  use  on
   DIGITAL's  KL10  and  KS10  systems.  You communicate with the TOPS-10
   operating system using the  TOPS-10  command  language.   The  TOPS-10
   operating system is also called the monitor.



   1.1  JOBS   1.1  JOBS

   TOPS-10 is a timesharing system; that is, the system transfers control
   rapidly  among a number of jobs, so that all jobs appear to be running
                             job   simultaneously.  The term job refers to the entire sequence  of  steps
   that  you start from your terminal or card deck.  You start a job from
   your terminal by using the LOGIN command, and you use the KJOB command
   to end your job.

   You can initiate a job at a central computer site  or  from  a  remote
   location.

   After you initiate a job,  you  can  initiate  a  second  job  without
   terminating  the  first.   For example, you can initiate a timesharing
   job and, using the SUBMIT command,  submit  a  second  job  for  batch
   processing.  (The SUBMIT command is discussed in Chapter 2.)

   When configuring and loading TOPS-10, the  system  administrator  sets
   the maximum number of jobs the system can process.



   1.2  CONNECTING TO THE SYSTEM   1.2  CONNECTING TO THE SYSTEM

   Only  authorized  users  have  access   to   TOPS-10.    Your   system
   administrator  provides  each  authorized  user  with  a  user name, a
   project programmer number (PPN), and a password.  These  identify  all
   users  and  their  corresponding  areas  on file structures.  When you
   specify a directory area, your  project-programmer  number  identifies
   you.   A  comma  separates the project and programmer numbers, and the


                                    1-1
                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION


   entire PPN is enclosed in square brackets.  For example, [27,4072].

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION


   The project numbers range from 1 to 377777  (octal).   The  programmer
   numbers  range  from  1  to  777777  (octal).  Numbers 1 through 7 are
   reserved for DIGITAL, and numbers 400000 through 777777  are  reserved
   for special purposes.

   Your password is one to thirty-nine characters long and is  used  when
   you  log  in to the system and when you attach to another job.  (Refer
   to the LOGIN and ATTACH commands, Chapter  2.)  To  maintain  password
   secrecy,  the  monitor  does  not  echo your password on the terminal.
   When you are using a terminal with local copy, a mask is printed  when
   you type your password, making the password unreadable.



   1.3  OPERATING SYSTEM MODES   1.3  OPERATING SYSTEM MODES

   You can run jobs  on  the  TOPS-10  operating  system  in  two  modes:
   interactive mode and batch mode.



   1.3.1  Interactive Mode   1.3.1  Interactive Mode

   Jobs that run in interactive mode use a terminal to access the system.
   The  language  you  use  to  run  a  job is the command language.  The
   commands you type on the terminal are received and  processed  by  the
   command language interpreter of the TOPS-10 monitor.  When your job is
   in interactive mode, you complete your work at  two  levels:   monitor

   1.4.1  Monitor Level   1.4.1  Monitor Level

   When your job is at monitor level,  you  are  communicating  with  the
   monitor.   The command language interpreter processes each command you
   type.  The monitor prompts you  with  a  period  (.).   Every  monitor
   command  should  follow  this  prompt.   You  end a monitor command by
   pressing the RETURN key (<RET>).

   The format of each command  is  variable  because  many  commands  are
   followed  by  optional  switches,  arguments, or values.  (See Section
   1.8.)

   Section 1.6  contains  descriptions  of  the  control  characters  and
   special keys you use when typing commands.



   1.4.2  User Level   1.4.2  User Level

   When you type the operating system command RUN, followed by a  program
   name,  your  job moves from monitor level to user level.  To move back
   to monitor level, type CTRL/C.  If the  program  is  not  waiting  for
   terminal  input,  it may be necessary to type CTRL/C twice.  (Refer to
   Section 1.6.1.)

   Other commands also bring your job to user level.  When your job is at
   user  level,  you  are working with a program other than the operating
   system itself.  Each program has its own set of commands and  its  own
   command  interpreter.   This  manual  describes  some system programs.
   System programs usually prompt with an asterisk (*).

   At user  level,  control  characters  and  special  keys  can  have  a
   different   effect   than  they  have  at  monitor  level.   Read  the
   description of each program to determine the effects  of  the  control
   characters and special keys.

   interactive job:

   1.5  CONTEXTS   1.5  CONTEXTS

     core image   A core image is what a job's portion of memory contains at  any  given
   time.   The  core  image,  as  well as information about the monitor's
                                                     context   state with respect to  your  job,  constitute  a  context.   When  you
   initialize  a  program,  your  context usually changes.  For instance,
   running the DIRECT program  creates  a  core  image  with  the  DIRECT
   program  in  it.  Exiting DIRECT and then running SYSTAT, for example,
   destroys what you had in memory (the DIRECT program)  and  loads  data
   pertinent to SYSTAT.

   Three commands allow you to display information  about  contexts,  and
   manipulate  them  in  various ways.  These commands are CONTEXT, PUSH,
   and POP.  CONTEXT and PUSH create additional  contexts.   POP  returns
   you  to  a superior context.  When you work with multiple contexts, at
   least one context  is  preserved  while  you  work  with  the  current
   context.

   You can work with multiple contexts by creating parallel contexts,  or
   creating  inferior  contexts.  The default maximum number of contexts,
   including current, parallel, and inferior, is  four.   The  number  of
   contexts  in  use  at any moment is shown by the CONTEXT command.  You
   can also use the CONTEXT command to  create  parallel  contexts.   You
   might  create a parallel context, run a frequently accessed program in
   it, and then exit, returning to your previous context.  Both  contexts
   now  exist  simultaneously.   When  you need to use the program in the
   created context, simply switch to that context.  You will not have  to
   wait  for  it  to  reinitialize.   The full description of the CONTEXT
   command in Chapter 2 gives an example of this procedure, including how
   to create and access a parallel context.

   The PUSH command allows you to create an inferior context.   When  you
   return  to  your  previous  task  in  a superior context, the inferior
   context is deleted.  You return to the superior context using the  POP
   command.    An  inferior  context  could  be  used  in  the  following
   situation:  If you were in the  process  of  completing  a  task,  and
   needed  to  see  some HELP text, you could create an inferior context,
   read the HELP text you needed, destroy the inferior context and return
   to the unchanged superior context.  The system automatically creates a
   new context for certain commands.  The  system  manager  can  set  the
   system to create a new context when any monitor command is issued.



   1.6  SPECIAL CHARACTERS   1.6  SPECIAL CHARACTERS

   The command language interpreter recognizes several special characters
   that cause specific functions to be performed.

   These special characters are described in the following sections.



   1.6.1  CTRL/C - Interrupt   1.6.1  CTRL/C - Interrupt

   When you type  a  CTRL/C  (control-C),  the  monitor  interrupts  your
   current  running  program  and  returns your terminal to monitor mode.
   You must type two CTRL/Cs if your program is not requesting input from
   your terminal (that is, if your program is executing).  If you issue a
   CTRL/C while typing a command in monitor mode, this  character  causes
   the  input  line to be deleted.  If you issue two CTRL/Cs while output
   is being printed on your terminal, the output is ended.

   Example   Example

        This example shows a program prompt.  CTRL/C brings your  job  to
        monitor level.

        *^C

        .



   1.6.2  DELETE Key   1.6.2  DELETE Key

   When you press the DELETE (RUBOUT) key, the monitor deletes  the  last
   character  you  typed.   This  function  permits you to correct typing
   errors.  When you press the DELETE key n times,  the  monitor  deletes
   the  last  n  characters  that  you typed.  On hard-copy terminals the
   monitor echoes all deleted characters on your  terminal  and  encloses
   the deleted characters in backslashes (\).

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION


   On video terminals the deleted characters that you typed  are  removed
   from  the screen.  However, you must inform the monitor of the kind of
   terminal you are using.  (Refer to the SET TTY command in Chapter  2.)
   After  you  press RETURN or ESCape, you cannot use the DELETE function
   on that line.

   Example   Example

        Type the characters SET TTY TYPE L036, press  the  DELETE  key  3
        times, then type the correct characters.

        .SET TTY TYPE L036\630\A36<RET>

        .



   1.6.3  CTRL/W - Delete Word   1.6.3  CTRL/W - Delete Word

   When you type CTRL/W (control-W), the monitor deletes  the  last  word
   you typed.

   A word is defined as all spaces,  tabs,  and  alphanumeric  characters
   until a nonalphanumeric character is encountered.

   On video terminals, the deleted word is erased from the screen.

   On hard-copy terminals, the deleted word is printed backwards  between
   backslashes.

   Example   Example

        Type the characters SET TTY TYPE L036, type CTRL/W, and type  the
        correct characters.

        .SET TTY TYPE L036\630L\LA36<RET>

        .



   1.6.4  CTRL/U - Delete Line   1.6.4  CTRL/U - Delete Line

   When you type CTRL/U (control-U), the  monitor  deletes  your  current
   input  line,  back  to the last time you pressed RETURN.  On hard-copy
   terminals, the  monitor  responds  with  a  carriage-return/line-feed,
   after  which  you can retype the line.  On video terminals, the entire
   line that you typed is  removed  from  the  screen.   After  you  have
   pressed  RETURN,  you can no longer use the line-editing features (for
   example, CTRL/U and DELETE) on that line.

        .



   1.6.5  CTRL/R - Reprint Line   1.6.5  CTRL/R - Reprint Line

   When you type CTRL/R (control-R), the  monitor  reprints  the  current
   input  line.   If  you  type a line incorrectly, then make corrections
   using the DELETE key, the monitor will print the corrected  line  when
   you  type CTRL/R.  The following is an example of this operation using
   a hard-copy terminal:

   Example   Example

        If you type:

        SET TTQ<DEL>Y N0<DEL>O FILE<DEL>L

        The line appears as:

        .SET TTQ\Q\Y N0\0\O FILE\E\L

        If you then press CTRL/R:

        .SET TTQ\Q\Y N0\0\O FILE\E\L ^R

        The monitor prints:

        SET TTY NO FILL

   When you type CTRL/R, the monitor issues  a  carriage-return/line-feed
   before printing the corrected input line.  The cursor or printing head
   of your terminal is left at its previous location.

   If a program such as your text editor uses CTRL/R for another purpose,
   you  can disable the CTRL/R function using the SET TTY RTCOMP command.
   (See Chapter 2 for a complete description of this command.)

   1.6.6  CTRL/O - Cancel Output   1.6.6  CTRL/O - Cancel Output

   When you type CTRL/O (control-O), the monitor cancels output  to  your
   terminal.   This  function  is useful when a program begins to print a
   long message that you are not interested in reading.  If  you  do  not
   want  to  wait for the monitor to finish printing the message, you can
   stop the monitor from printing the message one of  two  ways.   First,
   you  can type two CTRL/Cs, but this action also stops the execution of
   the program.  Second, you can type a single CTRL/O.

   When you type CTRL/O, the monitor continues  executing  your  program,
   but  does  not  print any output on your terminal.  The monitor begins
   printing to your terminal when one of the following conditions occurs:

        o  The executing program requests input from your terminal.

        o  The program ends and returns control to the monitor.

        o  You type CTRL/C twice, which returns control to the monitor.

   To start the output to your terminal again, type another CTRL/O.



   1.6.7  CTRL/S - Hold Output   1.6.7  CTRL/S - Hold Output

   When you type CTRL/S (control-S), the monitor  holds  output  to  your
   terminal.   This control character works only after you have typed the
   SET TTY PAGE command.  (See Chapter  2.)  This  control  character  is
   useful if you have a display terminal, and you have to stop the output
   to read it.  To read the rest of the output, type CTRL/Q.



   1.6.8  CTRL/Q - Resume Output   1.6.8  CTRL/Q - Resume Output

   When you type CTRL/Q (control-Q), the monitor resumes output  to  your
   terminal.   CTRL/S  and CTRL/Q are useful when you are using a display
   terminal.  Used in conjunction with CTRL/S, you can stop and  continue
   output  to  your  terminal,  thus reading a file before it scrolls off
   your display screen.

   1.6.9  CTRL/T - Job Status   1.6.9  CTRL/T - Job Status

   When  you  type  CTRL/T  (control-T),  the   monitor   prints   status
   information  pertaining to your job on your terminal.  CTRL/T does not
   echo on your terminal.  There are 11 items of  information  output  to
   your terminal.  These items are:

        1.  The incremental daytime (which is the  time  since  you  last
            issued  a  CTRL/T or a USESTAT command) or the time since you
            logged in if you have  not  issued  a  CTRL/T  or  a  USESTAT
            command.  (For example, Day: :05:43.)

        2.  The incremental runtime, which is the CPU time used since you
            issued  a  CTRL/T,  USESTAT  command,  LOGIN command, or TIME
            command.  (For example, Run:0.48.)

        3.  The incremental disk reads,  which  is  the  number  of  disk
            blocks read since you issued a CTRL/T, USESTAT command, LOGIN
            command, or DSK command.  (For example, Rd:75.)

        4.  Incremental disk writes, which is the number of  disk  blocks
            written  since  you  issued  a CTRL/T, USESTAT, LOGIN, or DSK
            command.  (For example, Wr:8.)

        5.  The program name.  (For example, SOS.)

        6.  The memory size.  (For example, 12+19P.)

        7.  The current context number (for example, Ctx:1.)

        8.  The job state.  The job state  codes  are  described  in  the
            SYSTAT  command description in Chapter 2.  (For example, ^C.)
            An ampersand after the job state code indicates  the  job  is
            locked  in  core.  An asterisk indicates the job is being run
            or swapped.

        9.  The program counter, which is  the  address  of  the  current
            instruction.  (For example, PC:400275.)
|  
|      10.  The CPU that the job last ran on.  (For example, CPU0.)

       11.  The job state, which can be INPUT WAIT or OUTPUT WAIT.   This
            item  is  printed  only when you type CTRL/T from user level.
            (For example, OUTPUT WAIT FOR TTY21.)

   This information can be obtained with the USESTAT command  at  monitor
   level.   However,  by  typing  CTRL/T,  you  can  determine your job's
   progress without interrupting its execution.  When  you  type  CTRL/T,
   the  character  is  not  passed  to  your  job  as an input character.
   However, some programs activate a special interrupt feature  when  you
                          _______ _______ _____ ______   type CTRL/T.  (See the TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual.)

   If a system program, such as your text editor uses CTRL/T for  another
   purpose,  you can disable the CTRL/T function using the SET TTY RTCOMP
   command.  (See Chapter 2 for a complete description of this command.)

   1.7  TYPE-AHEAD CAPABILITY   1.7  TYPE-AHEAD CAPABILITY

   Type-ahead allows you to type another command without waiting for  the
   monitor  to respond to your first command.  If you want two operations
   performed, you can begin typing the request for the  second  operation
   before you receive the prompt that the monitor prints after completing
   the first operation.  If an error occurs during the  first  operation,
   the characters you typed ahead are ignored.



   1.8  COMMAND FORMATS   1.8  COMMAND FORMATS

   The general format of each command is a line  of  ASCII  uppercase  or
   lowercase   characters   or  a  mixture  of  uppercase  and  lowercase
   characters.  You type  the  commands  after  the  monitor  prints  the
   TOPS-10  prompt  (.).   The  following  are  examples of valid TOPS-10
   commands:

        .DIRECT
        .direct
        .dirECT

   If you type spaces or tabs before a command name, the  system  ignores
   them.  For example, the following commands produce the same result:

        .DIRECT
        .     DIRECT

   The commands you type to the command language interpreter are  one  to
   six  characters  long.   If  you  type  any  character  past the sixth
   character,  the  monitor  ignores  it.   You  need  only  type  enough
   characters to uniquely identify the command.

   It is sometimes possible to abbreviate a command by typing  characters
   fewer  than  would  make  the command unique.  This is not encouraged,
   however, because uniqueness of a command may vary from monitor release
   to monitor release.  For this reason, you should use the whole command
   in a batch control file.

   1.8.1  Command Termination   1.8.1  Command Termination

   You terminate every command to the  command  language  interpreter  by
   pressing the RETURN key.  For example:

        .DIRECT<RET>



   1.8.2  Line Continuation   1.8.2  Line Continuation

   You can continue a command line  to  some  system  programs,  such  as
   DIRECT  and  QUEUE,  by  placing  a  hyphen  (-) as the last nonblank,
   noncomment character before you press the RETURN key.  These  programs
   treat  continuation  lines  as part of the current command line.  This
   feature allows you to type indefinitely long command lines.  A line is
   terminated by a <RET> that is not preceded by a hyphen.



   1.8.3  Command Arguments   1.8.3  Command Arguments

   You specify arguments to a command after the command name and separate
   them  from  the  command  name  by  a  space.  If the command language
   interpreter recognizes a command name, but  cannot  find  a  necessary
   argument, the monitor responds with the error message:

        ?TOO FEW ARGUMENTS

   Example   Example

        The ASSIGN command requires arguments.

        .ASSIGN<RET>

        System error message:

        ?TOO FEW ARGUMENTS

        TOPS-10 prompt:

        .

   After the monitor prints the error message, your terminal is  left  in
   monitor mode, as indicated by the monitor prompt.  You can then retype
   the command.

                        the letter D.  Otherwise, hours is required.

        minutes        minutes         is optional.

        seconds        seconds         is optional.  However, if  you  specify  seconds,
                        minutes  must  also  be  given or seconds will be
                        interpreted as minutes.

   You must type a colon to separate one field from the other.   You  can
   precede  a  relative  argument  with an optional plus (+) or minus (-)
   sign.  The sign implies either past (-) or future (+).   When  you  do
   not specify number of days, you must precede the time with a plus sign
   or a minus sign.  For example:

        -3D:4:27:21

   means 3 days, 4 hours, 27 minutes, and 21 seconds ago.  Similarly:

        +4

   means 4 hours from now.

                  N, and D.

                  The year and its preceding hyphen are optional, and, if
                  given,  can  be one, two, or four digits.  For example,
                  0, 90, and 1990 will all be  interpreted  as  the  year

   Because the date is known to be past or future from either the  switch
   used  (/BEFORE and /SINCE imply past, /AFTER implies the future) or by
   a plus or minus sign, an unspecified field is filled in  so  that  the
   result  is  the next or last occurrence of the specified date.  If you
   omit the time argument, the time defaults to  00:00:00  (midnight)  if
   past,  and  23:59:59  (11  o'clock,  59  minutes, and 59 second PM) if

   1.8.4  Command Switches   1.8.4  Command Switches

   You can modify some commands by including  a  switch  in  the  command
   line.   You precede each switch with a slash (/) and terminate it with
   a nonalphanumeric  character,  usually  <RET>,  a  comma,  or  another
   switch.   You  can  abbreviate  the switch if its name remains unique.
   Abbreviation is  not  recommended  for  batch  control  files.   Valid
   switches  for  each  command  are  documented  as  part of the command
   descriptions in Chapter 2.  The following is an example of a  command,
   command argument, and command switch:

   Example   Example

        .PRINT MYFILE.EXT/COPIES:2



   1.8.4.1  Temporary Switches   1.8.4.1  Temporary Switches - The switches for COMPILE-class  commands
   are  either  temporary  (local)  or permanent (global).  COMPILE-class
   commands are further described in  Appendix  C.   A  temporary  switch
   applies  only to the immediately preceding file.  Do not place a space
   or comma between the  file  name  and  the  switch.   In  the  command
   construction:

        .COMPILE PROG,TEST/MACRO,SUBLET

   the /MACRO switch applies only to the file named TEST.



   1.8.4.2  Permanent Switches   1.8.4.2  Permanent Switches - A permanent switch, sometimes  called  a
   sticky  switch, applies to all files following it on the command line,
   until you modify it by a subsequent switch.  You separate  the  switch
   from  the  file name by spaces, commas, or a combination of both.  For
   example, using the /MACRO switch:

   2 list the switches for these commands.



   1.8.5  Comments   1.8.5  Comments

   You can type a comment on the same line as a command by preceding  the
   comment  with  a  semicolon (;) or exclamation point (!).  The monitor
   and  the  batch  command  language  interpreters  do  not  attempt  to
   interpret  the  characters  after  the  semicolon.   Comment lines are
   useful when you are using a  hard-copy  terminal,  or  making  control
   files  for  batch  jobs.   The  following is an example of a line that
   contains both a command and a comment:

        .DIRECT    ;will list names of files in default area <RET>

   1.9  FILE SPECIFICATION   1.9  FILE SPECIFICATION

   The system stores programs and data as named  files.   When  they  are
   stored   on   DECtape   or  disk,  files  are  identified  by  a  file
   specification.   The  file  specification   includes   the   following
   identifications:

        1.  A device name or file structure name

        2.  A file name

        3.  A file name extension

        4.  An ordered list of directory names

        5.  An access protection code

   The file specification is necessary to identify a disk file.   If  you
   issue a file specification for devices other than DECtape or disk, the
   monitor ignores them.  File specifications are used to choose  a  file
   from  a  directory,  a  set  of  files  belonging  to a specific user.
   DECtapes and disks are the only directory-oriented devices.   Items  4
   and 5 in the above list do not apply to DECtapes.

       device name   The device name can be any valid device name described in the  Section
   1.9.1.   Always type a colon following the device name.  An example of
   a device name is DSKC:.

     file name   A file name is  one  to  six  alphanumeric  characters.   The  monitor
   ignores  all  characters  past the sixth.  File names are discussed in
   Section 1.9.2.  An example of  a  device  name  and  a  file  name  is
   DSKC:MYFILE.

       file name extension   The file name extension is a period (.)  followed  by  zero  to  three
   characters.   It  is  used  to indicate the type of information in the
   file.  (Refer  to  Appendix  D  for  a  list  of  standard  file  name
   extensions.)  For the most efficient use of system resources, use only
   standard file name extensions, though other extensions can  be  valid.
   Most  programs  recognize file names and extensions consisting only of
   letters and digits.  Often the term file name refers to both the  file
   name  and the file extension.  An example of a device name, file name,
   and file extension is DSKC:MYFILE.TXT.

       directory name   The directory name identifies the disk area where the file is  stored.
   This  list  can  be  a  user  file  directory (UFD) represented by the
   owner's project-programmer number, or a user file  directory  followed
   by  one  or  more  sub-file  directories  (SFDs).   You must enclose a
   directory name in square brackets ([]).  Directory names are discussed
   in  Section  1.9.3.   An  example  of  a  device name, file name, file
   extension and directory name is DSKC:MYFILE.TXT[21,589].

       access  protection  code   The access  protection  code  of  a  file  is  a  3-digit  octal  code
   designating  the  users who can read or write the file.  The code must
   be enclosed in angle brackets (< >),  and  you  specify  it  only  for
   output  files.  For a given file, users are divided into three groups:
   owner of the file, users with the same project number  as  the  owner,
   and  all other users.  The standard protection code is <057>, allowing
   users in the owner's  project  to  read  and  execute  the  file,  and
   preventing  access  by  all other users.  The standard protection code
   may be different at your installation.  Protection codes are described
   in  Section  1.9.4.   An  example  of  a  full  file  specification is
   DSKC:MYFILE.TXT[21,589]<055>.

   The following information is necessary when you refer to a file:

         o  The file name.

         o  The device name, if the file is not on disk and not  in  your
            default search list.

         o  The directory name, if the file is not in your directory.

   The following information is optional in a file specification:

         o  The file name extension.

         o  The device name, if the file is on a file structure  in  your
            search list.

         o  The directory name, if the file is in your directory.

         o  The protection code (if an output file).

   1.9.1  Device Names   1.9.1  Device Names

   TOPS-10 supports a number of peripheral input/output devices to handle
   data acquisition, storage, retrieval, and display.  These devices are:

        Card Punch            Card Reader          DECtape
        Disk                  Display Terminal     Graphics Display
        Hard-copy Terminal    Line Printer         Magnetic Tape
        Paper Tape Punch      Paper Tape Reader    Plotter

   The monitor allocates a device to your job when you request access  to
   the  device.   (Refer  to the ASSIGN and MOUNT commands in Chapter 2.)
   Until you request a device, it resides in the system pool of available
   resources.

   To reference a device, you must specify a device name.  In the command
   descriptions  in  this  manual,  places where you must supply a device
   name have the symbol dev:  in the command line format.  The  types  of
   device  names  are  listed  in Table 1.1 and are described in Sections
   1.9.1.1 through 1.9.1.5.

     generic               These specify a generic type of device  such
                           as a disk (DSK:) or a magnetic tape (MTA:).

     physical              These specify a particular physical unit  on
                           a   specific   controller   such  as  MTA1:,
                           magnetic-tape unit number 1.

     logical               These are substitute names for devices.  You
                           assign these names with the ASSIGN command.

     ersatz                These are  names  for  ersatz  (pseudo-disk)
                           devices  normally  used to contain libraries
                           or special directories.

     system defined        These  are  names  defined  by  the  system.
     logical               Each name corresponds to a physical unit  so
                           long  as  the  unit  is  declared  to be the
                           system default for that unit.

   1.9.1.1  Generic Device Names   1.9.1.1  Generic Device Names - The most general type of  device  name
   is  the  generic  device  name.   When you specify a generic name, the
   monitor selects a free unit of the device type specified.   When  your
   computer  is  in a network environment, the monitor chooses the device
   from those devices at your location, or, if none  are  available,  the
   monitor chooses the device from the host (central) site.

   A generic name can be two or three letters long and is followed  by  a
   colon (:).  The generic names are listed in Table 1-2.

   Two-character generic names are  less  specific  than  three-character
   generic  names.   For  example,  MT: means any magnetic tape unit, but
   MTA: means any magnetic tape unit on controller A.  When  you  specify
   the generic name DSK: or DS:, the monitor uses your job search list to
   determine which disk device should be selected  for  you.   (Refer  to
   Section 1.12.)

   When  you  specify  a  generic   name,   the   monitor   selects   the
   lowest-numbered  available  unit  of the device type specified.  There
   are two defaults when you specify a generic name:

        1.  When your program specifies DSK or DS, the system  uses  your
            job search list.

        2.  When you specify TTY: or TT:, the monitor always selects your
            terminal (assuming that these are not logical names).



   1.9.1.2  Physical Device Names   1.9.1.2  Physical Device Names - Every I/O device has a physical name.
   This  name  consists  of  the  generic  name,  a letter indicating the
   controller, and one numeric character indicating the unit number.  For
   example,  the  generic  name  MTA: indicates any magnetic tape unit on
   controller A.  However,  MTA1:  indicates  magnetic  tape  unit  1  on
   controller A.



   1.9.1.3  File Structures   1.9.1.3  File Structures - The TOPS-10 operating system organizes disk
   devices   into   file   structures.    File   structures  are  logical
   arrangements of 128-word blocks on one or more  disk  units.   A  file
   structure  can  exist  on one disk unit, or it can be distributed over
   several disk units designated by a single  name.   However,  two  file
   structures cannot exist on the same unit.

   The operator or system administrator assigns  a  name  to  every  file
   structure  when  he or she defines the system's file structures.  This
   name is one to four characters long, and cannot duplicate  a  physical
   device  name,  a  unit  name, or an existing file structure name.  The
   recommended   names   for   public   file   structures   are    DSKA:,
   DSKB:,...,DSKO: in order of decreasing speed.

                                                                  _______   File structures are illustrated and explained in detail in the TOPS-10

   1.9.1.4  Logical Device Names   1.9.1.4  Logical Device Names - You can assign a  logical  name  to  a
   physical device.  The monitor will recognize the name that you assign,
   and associate the logical name with  the  physical  device.   You  can
   assign a logical name to a device using the ASSIGN command.

   The logical name that  you  assign  may  be  up  to  six  alphanumeric
   characters  and  may  optionally be ended by a colon (:).  Thereafter,
   the monitor will use the device that you associated with  the  logical
   name,  when  you  or your programs specify that logical name.  Logical
   names are cleared by the DEASSIGN command.  That is, use the  DEASSIGN
   command to disassociate logical names from devices.  Logical names are
   also cleared when you log off the system, and when you specify another
   logical name for the same device.

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION


   Logical names are useful when you are writing a program that  needs  a
   device,  but you will not know until program execution what device you
   will need.  Use a logical name in the program to represent the device.
   Before  you  run  the  program use the ASSIGN command to associate the
   logical name with a physical device.

   Logical names take precedence over physical names.  Therefore, if  you
   assign the logical name DSK: to the device MTA3: (magnetic tape unit 3
   on controller A), all output to generic DSK will go  to  the  magnetic
   tape.

   Some names are recognized by the  monitor  as  special  system-defined
   logical  names that the monitor translates into physical device names.
   One example is the generic device name OPR:.  The generic name OPR: is
   the system-default logical name for the operator's terminal.

   Therefore, the terminal specified as OPR:  can  change  during  system
   operation;  but  if  you  send  a message to OPR:, the message will be
   routed to the last physical  device  declared  to  be  the  operator's
   terminal at your node.

                                                               restricted   All devices except terminals can be  designated  as  being  restricted
   devices   devices.   You  request  a  restricted  device from the system pool of
   available resources  by  issuing  the  MOUNT  command.   This  command
   requires operator intervention before the specified device is assigned
   to your job.  The system deassigns a restricted device from  your  job
   when you log off the system or issue the DISMOUNT, DEASSIGN, or FINISH
   command.

   Unrestricted devices  are  assigned  to  your  job  on  a  first-come,
   first-served  basis  when  you issue the MOUNT or ASSIGN command.  The
   device assignment remains in effect until you release  the  device  by
   issuing  a  DEASSIGN  command  or a FINISH command, or you log off the
   system.

   1.9.2  File Names   1.9.2  File Names

   Data and programs are stored in the system files.  Files are  used  to
   arrange  and  protect data and programs.  The essential part of a file
   specification is the file name.  You name  a  file  when  you  create,
   rename, or copy it.

   The file name  that  you  choose  must  be  one  to  six  alphanumeric
   characters  long.   It is possible to use non-alphanumeric characters,
   but some symbols have a special meaning to  the  system  (see  Section
   1.10),   and   some   programs   may  not  recognize  non-alphanumeric
   characters.

   The file name is divided into the  name  of  the  file  and  the  file
   extension.  The format is:

        FILE.EXT

   Where FILE is the name you choose to distinguish the file, and .EXT is
   a  standard or non-standard file extension.  The period (.) is used to
   separate the file name from the file extension.

   It  is  recommended  that  you  use  standard  file  extensions  where
   applicable.   The standard file name extensions are listed in Appendix
   D.  File extensions are optional.  You can  name  or  specify  a  file
   without an extension.

   File names and extensions can be changed using the RENAME command.



   1.9.3  Directory Names   1.9.3  Directory Names

   Your directory is a file that serves as an index to your other files.

   There are directories on three levels of file storage:

        The directories in a file structure are  indexed  by  the  Master
        File Directory (MFD) of that structure.

        The files in your directory area are indexed  by  your  User-File
        Directory    (UFD).     Your    UFD   is   designated   by   your
        project-programmer number enclosed in brackets.  The following is
        a valid directory name:

        [30,112]

        A Sub-File Directory (SFD), is a  directory  you  can  create  to
        arrange  the files in your UFD.  A file in your UFD points to the
        SFD.  This file has the same name as the SFD, with  an  extension
        of .SFD.  SFDs are discussed in Section 1.14.

   1.9.4  Protection Codes   1.9.4  Protection Codes

   Every file has a protection code.  The code tells who can  and  cannot
   access  the file.  The protection code consists of three octal digits.
   Each digit specifies the amount  of  protection  against  a  group  of
   users.   The  first  (leftmost)  digit  is the protection code for the
   owner of the file; the middle digit is the  protection  code  for  all
   users  having  the  same  project  number  as the file owner; the last
   (rightmost) digit is the protection code for  all  other  users.   For
   example:


           <0      5       7>
            |      |       |
            |      |       |
            |      |       Protection code for all other users.
            |      |
            |      |
            |      Protection code for all members of file owner's
            |      project.
            |
            |
            Protection code for the file owner.


   Ordinarily, the owner of a file is the user  whose  programmer  number
   matches  the User File Directory (UFD) containing the file, regardless
   of the project number.  That is, a user logged in under the  [27,4072]
   project-programmer  number  is assumed to be the owner of files in the
   User File Directory  [44,4072].   This  feature  can  be  set  by  the
   installation; therefore it may not be set at your own installation.

   The access protection codes for the Owner Field (Field 1)  are  listed
   in  Table  1-3;  the  access  protection  codes for Fields 2 and 3 are
   listed in Table 1-4.

   1.9.5  File Daemon   1.9.5  File Daemon

   The File Daemon, a system program, may determine the protection status
   of  files  with a file protection code of 4, 5, 6, or 7 in the owner's
   protection field.  (Protection codes are discussed in Section  1.9.4.)
   When you set such a protection, a protection violation causes the File
   Daemon to access a file named ACCESS.USR.  The file  ACCESS.USR  is  a
   list of the protected files and the users who may access them.  If you
   have no such file, or if the File Daemon is not running, the user  who
   attempted  to  access  the  file receives an error message, and cannot
   access the  file.   The  File  Daemon  and  the  file  ACCESS.USR  are
   described in the FILDAE Specification in the TOPS-10 Notebook Set.



   1.10  SYSTEM DEFAULTS   1.10  SYSTEM DEFAULTS

   The operating system contains defaults for  many  arguments,  switches
   and  parts  of  file  specifications.   Defaults  are  the  values  or
   instructions that the system uses if you do not specify  those  values
   or instructions in the command string.

   Some system defaults are set  by  the  system  administrator  when  he
   generates  the  monitor.   Other  defaults  are  set according to your
   project-programmer number when you log in.  There  are  commands  that
   allow  you  to  set  some  defaults, which will be effective until you
   change those defaults or log off the system.

   File specification defaults are determined by the system according  to
   the  program  you are running, the search list, and the directory path
   of your job.  Search  lists  and  directory  paths  are  discussed  in
   Sections 1.12 and 1.14.



   1.11  WILDCARD CONSTRUCTIONS   1.11  WILDCARD CONSTRUCTIONS

   You can use wildcard  constructions  with  many  command  strings.   A
   wildcard   is   an   asterisk  used  to  specify  a  part  of  a  file
   specification, or a question mark used to replace  a  character  in  a
   file specification field.

   You use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard to designate an entire part  of
   a specification.

   You can use the question mark as a wildcard to designate  a  character
   of  a file specification.  You type a question mark for each character
   that is to be matched.  For example, PR??  matches four characters  or
   less, of which the first two are PR.

   The DIRECTORY and QUEUE programs recognize a number sign  (#)  in  the
   file  specification  to  indicate that SIXBIT octal code follows.  For
   example,

        .DIR #640000000000.

   gives the same directory listing as

        .DIR T.

   because 120000000000 is the 36-bit left-justified SIXBIT code for  the
   character  "T".   This function is useful for file names which contain
   special characters.  Although the  SIXBIT  code  for  an  asterisk  is
   120000000000, the command line

        .DIR #120000000000.

   would not give the same directory listing as

        .DIR *.

   because the first command would list only a file  literally  named  *.
   The  second command would interpret the * as a wildcard and would list
   all files without extensions.

   You cannot mix SIXBIT code and regular characters within the file name
   or  within the file extension.  However, you can combine a SIXBIT file
   name with a regular file extension and vice versa.

   Appendix G contains a chart of SIXBIT and ASCII character codes.

   You can  specify  a  directory  name  with  the  project  number,  the
   programmer  number,  or  both  numbers missing from the specification.
   The following examples represent directory specifications.

   1.12  SEARCH LISTS   1.12  SEARCH LISTS

   A search list is a list of file structures listed in  the  order  that
   the  operating  system will search through them for a file.  There are
   two types:  the system search list and a job search list.

   The system search list, designated by the  ersatz  device  name  SSL:,
   contains all files pertinent to the daily operation of the system.  It
   is  the  same  for  every  job  on  the  system.   Only   the   system
   administrator  can  define  and  change  this  list.  However, you may
   display the system search list using the SETSRC program.

   Some of the types of  files  kept  in  the  system  search  list  file
   structures  include:   accounting files, help and documentation files,
   compilers, and system programs.

   The job search list, designated by the ersatz device name DSK:,  lists
   structures  that contain user files for an individual job.  The system
   administrator creates the default job search list for  each  new  user
   account.   You  can  display,  add,  remove,  and  rearrange  the file
   structures in your job search list using the SETSRC  program.   (Refer
            _______  ____  _________  ______   to  the  TOPS-10  User  Utilities  Manual  for  more information about
   SETSRC.) The MOUNT and DISMOUNT commands also modify your  job  search
   list.  (MOUNT and DISMOUNT are described in Chapter 2.)

   For example, in the following command line

        .MAKE TEST.LIS

   the system uses the system search list  to  find  the  program  (TECO)
   invoked  by the MAKE command.  The system uses your job search list to
   find your user file TEST.LIS.

   The format of the job search list is:

        fs/switch,fs/switch,...FENCE,fs/switch...

           fs   Where:  fs       is the file structure name,

           FENCE           FENCE    is a logical delimiter to separate the active  search
                    list from the passive structures.

           /switch           /switch  indicates how the file can be  accessed  (read  only,
                    for example).

   The job search list has two parts, the  active  search  list  and  the
   passive  search  list.   The  active  search  list is the list of file
   structures on the left side of the fence.  The system searches each of
   these file structures from left to right.





                                    1-34

   The passive search list is to the right of the fence.  It is  composed
   of  the  file  structures that you removed from the active search list
   using the SETSRC program.  Therefore, when you first log in, you  have
   no structures in your passive search list.  The file structures in the
   passive search list are not searched by the the monitor, but are  used
   to compute disk usage when you log off the system.



   1.13  LIBRARIES   1.13  LIBRARIES

   The system libraries contain  compilers,  system  programs  and  other
   important files.  Wherever a device can be specified, an ersatz device
   may be specified instead.   An  ersatz  device  is  a  monitor-defined
   logical name for a directory specification.  There are several special
   ersatz devices defined for some libraries.  There are  three  separate
   PPNs,  [1,3],  [1,4],  and  [1,5],  where  system library files can be
   stored.  The standard version of a file or program is usually found on
   SSL:[1,4].

   The newest version of a file, sometimes in an experimental or untested
   state,  can sometimes be found in the [1,5] system library.  NEW: is a
   special ersatz device.  When the operating system looks for a file  on
   NEW: it will first look on SSL:[1,5].  If the file is not found there,
   however, it will next look on SSL:[1,4] for the same file.   Likewise,
   an  outdated  version of a file might be found on OLD:, which searches
   SSL:[1,3] before SSL:[1,4].

   The current system library for the job is  called  SYS:.   By  default
   SYS:  is  SSL:[1,4] or the standard system library.  You may, however,
   change the default definition of SYS: by specifying the /NEW switch to
   LOGIN  or  to the SETSRC program.  This changes the definition of SYS:
   to be NEW:.  In other words, the  system  looks  on  SSL:[1,5]  before
   looking  on  SSL:[1,4].  When you use the R command, the program comes
   from SYS:.

   LIB: is the job's library directory.  If you define LIB:, any file the
   system  cannot  find  on  DSK:  will  be searched for in the user-file
   directory (UFD) defined in LIB:.   LIB:  may  be  set  by  the  SETSRC
   program.



   1.14  DIRECTORY PATHS   1.14  DIRECTORY PATHS

   A directory path is an ordered list of directory names, starting  with
   a   user-file   directory,   that  uniquely  identifies  a  directory.
   Directory names are discussed in Section 1.9.3.

   The default directory path for your job can be  any  directory:   your
   job's  user-file  directory  (UFD), a sub-file directory (SFD) in your
   job's UFD, a UFD different from  your  job's  UFD,  or  an  SFD  in  a
   different UFD.

   You can change your default directory path using the  SETSRC  program.
             _______  ____  _________  ______   See  the  TOPS-10  User  Utilities  Manual  for more information about
   SETSRC.

   Sub-file directories allow you to organize your files, and  to  access
   them  in  sets.  Any directory acts as an index to a set of files.  An
   SFD is pointed to by a file in the UFD, or by a higher-level SFD.  You
   create  SFDs  with  the  CREDIR  program, and you can nest them in any
   structure,  to  the  level  that  is  predetermined  by   the   system
   administrator.  The maximum level to which SFDs can be nested is five.
            _______ ____ _________ ______   (See the TOPS-10 User Utilities Manual for more information about  the
   CREDIR  program.)  Nested directories form a directory tree structure,
                               _______ _______ _____ ______   which is illustrated in the TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual.

   directory paths.

   1.15  USER-DEFINABLE COMMANDS   1.15  USER-DEFINABLE COMMANDS

   User-definable commands are available at both the  system  programming
   level and at the monitor command level for the timesharing user.

   As a timesharing user, you use the DECLARE command to define a command
   to  run  a  specified program for your job.  This can be done during a
   timesharing session, or you can  include  the  DECLARE  command  in  a
   SWITCH.INI  file.   Any  program  can  be  invoked with a user-defined
   command.

   For example, you can  define  COMPAR  as  a  user-defined  command  to
   execute the FILCOM program as follows:

        .DECLARE  COMPAR=SYS:FILCOM.EXE<RET>

   You can also use DECLARE to display  your  job's  command  list.   The
   commands in the following list were defined previously.

        .DECLARE/LIST<RET>

        COMPAR   LOOK   EDIT   DISKSP

   1.16  PROGRAMMING THE LN01 LASER PRINTER   1.16  PROGRAMMING THE LN01 LASER PRINTER

   This section describes the use of escape and control sequences,  which
   you  use  to direct printing on the LN01 laser printer.  Font loading,
   which is one application of control sequences, and font management are
   also discussed.  For a detailed discussion of programming on the LN01,

   1.16.1  LN01 ESCAPE AND CONTROL SEQUENCES   1.16.1  LN01 ESCAPE AND CONTROL SEQUENCES

   You can use escape and control  sequences  to  specify  tab  stops  or
   margins,   change   fonts  within  a  file,  or  indicate  the  text's
   orientation, for instance.  ESCape and control sequences are typed  in
   as  part of a file you want to print on the LN01 laser printer.  Every
   time the printer encounters the characters that introduce an escape or
   control  sequence, it regards the next few characters as instructions,
   until it encounters a final character (described below).  However, you
   must  specify the /PRINT:GRAPHICS switch to the PRINT or QUEUE command
   in order for  the  sequences  to  be  interpreted.   Otherwise,  these
   characters will be printed as part of the file.

   For a complete description of all valid escape and control  sequences,
                       ____ ____________ _________ ______   please refer to the LN01 Programmer's Reference Manual.

                                    NOTE

           You  use  the  ESC  control  character  as  the  first
           character  of  all escape and control sequences.  When
           referred to here, it means that you actually press the
           ESC  key.   Since  the  ESC  key  is  interpreted as a
           function by most text editors, consult  the  reference
           manual  to find out how your editor can actually print
           the ESC  control  character.   The  examples  in  this
           section  use  a  dollar  sign ($) to show that the ESC
           control character has been pressed.



   1.16.1.1  ESCape  Sequences   1.16.1.1  ESCape  Sequences - An  escape  sequence  can   have   three
   sections:    an  introducer,  intermediate  characters,  and  a  final
   character.  You must include the escape sequence introducer, which  is
   the  ESC  control character, and the final character; the intermediate
   characters  are  optional.    Intermediate   characters   define   the
   interpretation of the sequence.  The final character indicates the end
   of a string, and is defined by the function requested in the sequence.

   The following sequence shows how to reset a printer to a known state:

        ESC control character
         |    Final character
         |      |
         |      |
         $      c

   The characters are spaced here for clarity only.   The  sequence  must
   appear  as  $c  to  actually  be  interpreted  by  the  LN01.  Case is
   significant when final characters are alphabetic.



   1.16.1.2  Control Sequences   1.16.1.2  Control Sequences - The  format  for  control  sequences  is
   similar to that of escape sequences.  However, control sequences begin
   with an ESC control character and a left square bracket.  Also, one or
   more  parameters  are  allowed  before  the intermediate character(s).
   Parameters are separated by the use of a semicolon (;).

   Numeric parameters that designate length (such as specifying 5 inches)
   are  given  in  terms  of  points or decipoints.  A point is a unit of
   length equal to 1/72 of an inch.  A decipoint, then, is  a  length  of
   1/720  of an inch.  In these units, 5 inches equals 360 points or 3600
   decipoints.

   A sequence using length in points is below.  In this example, the left

   1.16.2  Font Management   1.16.2  Font Management

   The LPTSPL program supports font management for the LN01 laser printer
   by  means  of  a font handler.  LPTSPL requires the LPFONT.INI file to
   automatically  process  fonts  by   name.    LPFONT.INI   resides   on
   SSL:[5,36,LN01].  LPFONT.INI maps the font names to the files in which
   the actual fonts are kept.  Font files must be kept in the same area.

   LPFONT.INI has the format:

        filenm = fontnm1<TAB>fontnm2<TAB>...<TAB>fontnmN

           filenm   Where:  filenm is the six character filename of the font.

           fontnm           fontnm is an alphanumeric string from 1 to 30 characters long,
           representing  a  fontname.  Each fontname must be separated by
           at least one tab character, and the line must be ended with  a
           carriage return/line feed.

   1.16.3  Loading Fonts   1.16.3  Loading Fonts

   When you want to print a file using non-standard fonts, you  have  two
   options.   You  may  use  the  either  /FONT:fontnm or /PRINT:GRAPHICS
   switches to the PRINT or QUEUE commands.

   Use the /FONT:fontnm switch when you want an entire  file  printed  in
   the same font.  LPTSPL loads the font you request, and the LN01 prints
   your file in the font you specified.

   The /PRINT:GRAPHICS switch allows you to dynamically  load  fonts,  so
   that  you  can  print  a  file  in  several different fonts.  The Load
   Character Set (LCS) and Assign Character Set (ACS) sequences are  used
   to  prepare  the  fonts  for  printing.   If you are using fonts which
   reside on the ersatz device FNT: ([5,36,LN01]), you  do  not  need  to
   explicitly  specify  the LCS sequence; LPTSPL loads the character sets
   for you.  You will always  need  to  place  an  ACS  sequence  at  the
   beginning  of  your  file.   The ACS sequence assigns a font name to a
   number.  You refer to this number immediately before the text you want
   printed  in that font.  The text continues printing in that font until
   you specify a new font.  For example, if you assigned 13 to  represent
   a  Times  Bold font, and 14 to represent Times Italic, you could print
   text in those fonts using the following:

        $[13mPrint in Times Bold and $[14mnow switch to Italic

   In the above example, the ESC/square bracket combination  indicates  a
   control  sequence  is  about  to  follow,  the 13 and 14 represent the
   fonts, and the letter m is the final character.  For more  information

   In Section 2.1, the  TOPS-10  commands  are  divided  into  functional
   groups.  Each section contains:

         o  A discussion of a functional group.

         o  A list of the commands that make up the functional group.

   Section 2.2 contains a detailed  description  of  each  command.   The
   commands are arranged in alphabetical order.

   Appendix A of this manual contains a table that lists the commands  by
   functional description, including a short description of each command.
   This table is included for reference, so that you can find  a  command
   by  its  function.   Please  read  the  description of each command in
   Section 2.2 before using the command.

   Function   Function

        The ALLOCATE command informs the system  that  you  will  need  a
        resource.  A resource is a tape or disk unit.  With ALLOCATE, you
        can reserve a resource from the system and assign a logical  name
        to the resource you will use.

        An  allocated  resource  can  contain  all   the   specifications
        necessary  when  the  resource is mounted.  The switches that you
        specify with the ALLOCATE command will be  retained  and  applied
        when you use the MOUNT command to mount the same resource.

        The  ALLOCATE  command  allocates  a  resource,  and   the   SHOW
        ALLOCATION  display  will  show such a resource as both allocated
        and mounted.  If you  use  the  ALLOCATE  command  to  explicitly
        allocate  a resource, you will be granted extended ownership over
        the  resource.   For  example,  if  a  resource  that  you   have
        explicitly  allocated  and mounted goes off-line unexpectedly (as
        when the operator dismounts it),  your  mount  request  for  that
        resource will be automatically requeued, and the resource will be
        mounted for your job when it comes on line.

                              ALLOCATE Command


                  Note that a tape allocation request requires  a  volume
                  identification.   If  you do not include the volume set
                  name followed by volume identifiers,  you  must  supply
                  the /VOLID switch.

                  log-name                  log-name is the logical name  you  can  assign  to  the
                  resource that you will use.  The logical name can be up
                  to 6 alphanumeric characters.  A tape volume  set  must
                  always  have  a  logical name.  If you do not specify a
                  logical name for a tape volume set, the system defaults
                  to  the first six characters of the volume set name, or
                  up to  the  first  non-alphanumeric  character  of  the
                  volume  set name.  A disk volume set does not require a
                  logical-name.

                  To allocate more than  one  volume  set,  separate  the
                  volume set identifications with commas.

                  /switches                  /switches  are  always  preceded  by  a  slash.    Some
                  switches can be used for any kind of volume set; others
                  are restricted to either tape or disk volume sets only.

                                           NOTE

                      The logical name and switches that you  specify
                      in the ALLOCATE command string are saved by the
                      system, and are  applied  when  you  MOUNT  the
                      volume set.

        You can obtain a list of the resources  that  are  allocated  and
        mounted  for  your  job  by  typing ALLOCATE with no arguments or
        switches.  The output is the same as the  output  from  the  SHOW
        ALLOCATION command.

        The following is  a  list  of  the  switches  you  can  use  with
        ALLOCATE.   The  center  column lists the kind of resource(s) the
        switch applies to.

        /ACTIVE         Disk     Requests that the volume set  be  placed
                                 in  your  job's  active search list when
                                 the structure is mounted.   (See  SETSRC

                                 The structure will become  part  of  the
                                 list  that the system automatically uses
                                 to search  for  a  file.   This  is  the
                                 default.  Complement to /PASSIVE.

                                 status of the tape.  The  arguments  and
                                 their meanings are:

                                 ANSI      The   label    is    formatted
                                           according to ANSI standards.

                                 BLP       The tape  may or  may not have

                                 tapes  for  your  job  from  a  pool  of
                                 available  tapes.   This  switch implies

        /READ-ONLY      Tape     Specifies that you will not write on the
                        Disk     volume set.  Tape volume  sets  will  be
                                 checked  as  they are mounted, to ensure
                                 that they are write-locked.  This is the
                                 default for tape volume sets.

                                 On disk volume sets,  the  monitor  will
                                 not update access dates.  If you specify
                                 both  /EXCLUSIVE  and  /READ-ONLY,   the
                                 operator may write-lock the structure.

        /REMARK:"text"  Tape     Allows  you to  send  a message  to  the
                        Disk     operator identifying the  volume  to  be
                                 mounted.   The argument (text) can be up
                                 to 50 characters  long.   Use  quotation
                                 marks  around  the  text  if it contains
                                 spaces or punctuation marks.

        /SCRATCH        Tape     Instructs  the  operator  to   mount   a
                                 scratch tape.  By implication, a scratch
                                 tape will be returned  to  the  system's
                                 pool  of  available tapes, after you are
                                 finished with it.  This  switch  implies
                                 /WRITE-ENABLE.

        /SHARABLE       Disk     Allows  other  users   to   access   the
                                 resource.  This is the default function.
                                 This  switch  is   the   complement   to
                                 /EXCLUSIVE.

        /TAPE           Tape     Specifies that the volume set is a  tape
                                 volume  set.   This  switch  is required
                                 when the volume set has the same name as
                                 a catalogued disk volume set.

        /TRACKS:n       Tape     Specifies the number of  tracks  on  the
                                 tape.  The value n can be 7 or 9.

        /VOLID:volid    Tape     Identifies the volumes in a tape  volume
                                 set.   This  switch  can be used only if
                                 the   volid-list   was   not   specified
                                 previously.    If   the  volume  set  is
                                 comprised of more than one  volume,  the
                                 volids  should  be  separated by commas,
                                 and the volid-list should be enclosed in
                                 parentheses.

        /WRITE-ENABLE   Tape     Ensures   that  you  can  write  on  the
                        Disk     volume set.  For tape, the system checks
                                 each  volume as it is mounted to be sure
                                 that it is write-enabled.  This  is  the
                                 default for disk volume sets.

        The following example shows the use of the ALLOCATE,  DEALLOCATE,
        MOUNT, DISMOUNT, and SHOW ALLOCATION commands.  The resources are
        reserved for a multivolume tape  volume  set  with  the  ALLOCATE
        command.  The name of the volume set is TAPE-SET, and it contains
        three volumes.  The logical name TS is assigned to the tape  set.
        The tape is write enabled, and it does not have standard labels.

        The ASSIGN command allocates an input/output device to  your  job
        until  you  log  out  or  until  you issue a REASSIGN, FINISH, or
        DEASSIGN command.  (Device names are discussed in Section 1.9.1.)
        When  an  assignment  is  performed,  the system prints a message
        indicating the name of the physical device assigned to your job.

        You can ASSIGN any unrestricted device to your job.

        ASSIGN node-id_device-name: logical-name:

                  device  is  to  be  assigned.   This  identifier can be
                  either a node name or a node number.   The  node-id  is
                  optional.   If  you omit the node-id, the node to which
                  your terminal is connected is assumed.

                  The node-id and the device name must be separated by an
                  underscore (_).

                  device-name:                  device-name:  is any physical device name or previously
                  assigned  logical name.  (Device names are discussed in

                  logical-name                  logical-name is a logical name that you request  to  be

                  device name from the logical name with a  space.   This
                  argument   is  optional.   Subsequent  ASSIGN  commands
                  replace the old logical name with the new one.  Logical
                  names are disassociated from the devices when you issue
                  the DEASSIGN command.

        If the assignment is successful, the system prints a  message  in
        the following format:

        device-name: ASSIGNED

        where device-name is the physical device name .  If you specify a

        ?DEVICE NOT ASSIGNABLE

        You can access restricted devices using the MOUNT  command.   The
        following  message  occurs when the device is assigned to another

        The ATTACH command detaches your current job (if you  are  logged
        in) and connects your terminal to a detached job.

        To prevent unauthorized access  to  detached  jobs,  the  monitor
        temporarily   creates   a   new   job   when   you   specify  the
        project-programmer number  argument.   This  temporary  job  runs
        LOGIN,  which  asks  for  your  password.   If  the temporary job
        exceeds the system's maximum job capacity, you may be  unable  to
        attach  to  the  specified  job.   In  this  case, your first job
        remains detached.  You will be unable to ATTACH to any job  until
        there is room in the system.

                          requests are cancelled.

        /JOBNAME:name     Specifies the name of the job.  This switch  is
                          used  to  specify  the name of the job when the
                          request-id is the same as the name  of  another

        The CLOSE command terminates any input  or  output  currently  in
        progress on the specified device.

        Although most programs close files when they finish  executing  a
        command  string, the CLOSE command is provided for a program that
        does not terminate or a program that  is  being  debugged.   This
        command  causes all files which are open for output to be closed.
        If a CLOSE is not done, the next RESET by a command (R, RUN, GET)
        or program deletes any partially written disk files.

                  If dev:  is omitted, I/O is terminated on all  devices,

   Function   Function

        The COMPILE  command  produces  relocatable  binary  files  (.REL
        files)  and/or  compilation listings for specified source program
        files.  The system determines which language compiler to  use  by
        the  source  file  extension  or  by  switches you specify in the
        command string.  If you do not supply any switches in the command
        string,  but you do use a standard extension, the system uses the
        following compilers:

             Source File Extension    Compiler Used             Source File Extension    Compiler Used

             .ALG                     ALGOL compiler
             .BLI, .B10               BLISS-10 compiler
             .CBL                     COBOL compiler
             .F4 or .FOR              FORTRAN compiler
             .FAI                     FAIL compiler
             .MAC                     MACRO assembler
             .PAL                     PAL10 compiler
             .PAS                     Pascal compiler
             .P11                     MACY11 assembler
             .SAI                     SAIL compiler
             .SIM                     SIMULA compiler
             .SNO                     SNOBOL compiler

                                    NOTE

           The compiler cannot be changed with a switch,  but  it
           can  be  specified  with a switch when the source file
           has an unrecognizable or no extension.  If the  source
           file  has  a  non-standard  extension,  and you do not
           specify the compiler in a switch, FORTRAN is  used  as
           the  default  compiler.   All standard file extensions
           are listed in Appendix D.

        Usually, the system translates the source file  if  there  is  no
        corresponding  binary (.REL) file, or if the date and time of the
        source file is later than the date and time of the  binary  file.
        If the binary file is newer than the source file, the system does
        not generate a new .REL file.

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the
        command before running the appropriate language compiler.

        FAIL, MACY11, SAIL, and SNOBOL are recognized as  compilers  only
        if   the   appropriate   assembly   switches   are  set  at  your
        installation.

                              COMPILE Command


        Each  time  you  issue  the  COMPILE,  LOAD,  EXECUTE,  or  DEBUG
        commands,  the  system remembers the command, with its arguments,
        in a temporary file on disk  or  in  TMPCOR  if  they  are  small
        enough.   When  you  issue  one  of  these  commands  without  an
        argument, it causes the system to use the argument saved  in  the
        temporary file.

        The COMPILE command accepts several command constructions:  the @
        construction  (indirect  commands),  the  +  construction,  the =
        construction, and the < > construction.  Refer to Appendix C  for
        a complete description of each of these constructions.

        COMPILE file-spec/switch,file-spec/switch,...

                  file-spec        Where:    file-spec is a single file specification or a string of
                  file specifications, separated by commas.  The standard
                  file specification consists of:  a device name, a  file
                  name  (with  or  without an extension), and a directory
                  name.  If you omit the file specification argument, the
                  system  uses  the  argument  specified  in  a  previous
                  COMPILE-class command, if possible.  (Refer to  Section
                  1.9.)

                      Note that a maximum  of  150  processor  switch
                      characters can be passed to the compiler.

        You can use the following  switches  as  temporary  or  permanent
        switches.  (Refer to Section 1.8.4.) Switches relevant to COMPILE
        follow; all switches allowed with COMPILE can be used with  LOAD,

        /COMPILE      Forces a compilation of this source  file  even  if
                      the  relocatable  binary  file  is newer.  Use this
                      switch to obtain an extra compilation (for example,
                      to obtain a listing of the compilation).  NOCOMPILE
                      is the default switch.

        /CREF         Produces a listing file on the disk for  each  file
                      compiled, for later processing by the CREF program.
                      The file extension of the  listing  file  is  .CRF.
                      The  file can then be listed with the CREF command.
                      With COBOL files, the CREF file is appended to  the
                      output  file;  additional  commands  are  needed to

        /GFLOAT       Indicates that double-precision numbers are  to  be
                      stored  in  G-floating  format.  This format has an
                      expanded exponent range.  This option is  available
                      on KL10 processors only.

        /K?10         Designates the machine on which  the  program  will
                      execute  after  it has been loaded.  The default is
                      the processor that is executing the command.  The ?
                      can  be  replaced  by  L  or  S.  To designate a KS
                      processor, use /KS10.

        /LIBRARY      Loads  the  program   in   library   search   mode.
                      (/LIBRARY is identical to /SEARCH.)

        /LINK         Obsolete

        /LIST         Prints the listing file on the line printer (LPT:).
                      If the line printer is spooled or available to your
                      job, the listing file is automatically printed.

        /LMAP:file    Produces a  loader  map  while  loading.   The  map
                      contains local symbols.

        /MACRO        Assembles the file with MACRO.  Assumed  for  files
                      with the extension of .MAC.

        /MACY11       Assembles the file with MACY11.  Assumed for  files
                      with the extension .P11.  MACY11 is recognized as a
                      compiler only if the appropriate assembly switch is
                      set.  This switch is not supported.

        /MAP:file     Produces a loader map while loading.   The  default
                      file name is MAP.MAP.

        /NEW          Runs the appropriate  language  compiler  from  the
                      experimental  library area [1,5] (device NEW:).  If
                      the compiler does not exist on device NEW:,  COMPIL
                      tries to obtain it from device SYS:.

        /NOBINARY     Does not generate binary files.  This switch,  when
                      combined  with the /CREF or /LIST switch, is useful
                      when  compiling   programs   solely   to   generate
                      listings.

        /NOCOMPILE    Compiles the source file if there is no relocatable
                      file   newer  than  the  source  file.   Note  that
                      /COMPILE always compiles, /REL never compiles,  and
                      /NOCOMPILE    (the    default    switch)   compiles
                      conditionally.

        /NODEBUG      Does not pass  previously  specified  arguments  to
                      FORTRAN.

        /NOLIST       Does not  generate  listing  files.   This  is  the

                      system library [1,3] of old programs (device OLD:).
                      If the compiler does  not  exist  on  device  OLD:,
                      COMPIL tries to obtain it from device SYS:.

        /PAL10        Assembles the file with PAL10.  Assumed  for  files
                      with the .PAL extension.

        /PASCAL       Compiles the file with Pascal.  Assumed  for  files
                      with the .PAS extension.

        /REL          Loads an existing .REL file rather than compiling a
                      new one.  Refer also to /COMPILE and /NOCOMPILE.

        /SAIL         Compiles the file with  SAIL.   Assumed  for  files

        /SEARCH       Loads the program in library search mode.  (/SEARCH
                      is identical to /LIBRARY.)

        /SELF         Runs the appropriate language compiler from  device
                      DSK:   instead  of  from the system library (device
                      SYS:).  This switch is useful if you keep a private
                      copy of a compiler in your own disk area.

        /SIMULA       Compiles the file with SIMULA.  Assumed  for  files
                      with the .SIM extension.

        /SNOBOL       Compiles the file with SNOBOL.  Assumed  for  files

   Function   Function

        The CONTEXT command displays the status of a job's  context.   It
        also  allows  you  to  create, kill, and switch between contexts.
        When issued without arguments, the command gives you  information
        about  your  current contexts, such as the name of the program in
        core for that particular context.  You can also  use  CONTEXT  to
        create parallel contexts.  Parallel contexts permit you to switch
        between programs (in separate contexts) without waiting for  them
        to  reinitialize.  You can specify switches to list the status of
        a particular context or delete a context.  (Section 1.5  contains
        a discussion of contexts.)

                 displays  information  about all of your job's contexts,
                 including the program loaded in each context.

                 /switch                 /switch is one of the options listed below.

        Argument, when specified, can be one of the following:

             handle       A  context  name  or  number.   This   argument
                          switches  your  job's  current  context  to the
                          specified one.  A  period  (.)  can  replace  a
                          context name for the current context only.

             name=number  Where  name  is  a   one   to   six   character

                          context to the newly created context.

        /Switch, when specified with the handle argument, can be  one  of
        the following:

             /KILL  Deletes the specified parallel context.

             /LIST  Lists information about the specified context only.

            Note the differences from the previous status.  There are now
            two  contexts  in  use, and the current, unnamed context 2 is
            running MS.  Also, PATH has been idle for 19.78 seconds since
            the  last  CONTEXT  command was issued.  MS will restart very
            quickly if you type CONTINUE, because it  does  not  have  to
            re-initialize.

        4.  Finally, kill one context that is  running  MS,  and  examine
            your status.  You have to move to another context to do this,
            because you cannot kill the current context.

   Function   Function

        The COPY command copies a file from one  device  to  another,  or
        within  a  device,  file  structure,  or  directory.  The command
        string can contain one output specification  and  any  number  of
        input specifications.

        COPY dev:file.ext[directory]<nnn>=dev:file.ext[directory],...

        Where:    The file to the left of  the  equal  sign  (=)  is  the
                  destination,  or  output  file,  and the file(s) to the
                  right of  the  equal  sign  is  the  source,  or  input
                  file(s).

                  dev:                  dev:  is a physical or logical  device  name.   If  you
                  omit a device name, the system assumes DSK:.

                  file.ext                  file.ext is the name of the file(s) to be used in input
                  or  output.   If  you  omit  the  output file name, the
                  system  defaults  to  the  input  file  name.   If  you
                  transfer  many  input  files  to  one  output file, the
                  system  combines  the  files.   You  can  use  wildcard
                  constructions with the COPY command.

                  [directory]                  [directory] is the disk area in which the files are  to
                  be  read  or written.  If you type this area before the
                  file name, the system uses this area as the default for
                  all  succeeding files.  If you omit this argument, your
                  default directory is accessed.  You can transfer  files
                  to or from another directory only if you have access to
                  that directory.

                  <nnn>                  <nnn> is the protection code to be given to the  output
                  file.   If  you  omit this argument, the system assigns
                  the system standard protection code, even if the  input
                  file   already   has  a  non-standard  protection  code
                  associated with it.  Protection codes are described  in
                  Section 1.9.4.

                  Use the equal sign  (=)  to  separate  the  destination
                  (output) side from the source (input) side.

   Function   Function

        The CORE command prints or changes  the  amount  of  core  memory
        assigned  to  your  job.  Because programs usually allocate core,
        you generally do not need this command.

        If your job is locked in core and you issue this command  with  a
        nonzero argument, the monitor prints an error message.

             nx        CORE nx

                  n        Where:    n is a decimal number; this argument is optional.
                  You may not assign more than one  section  of  core  to
                  your job.

                  If n is 0, the low and high segments are  removed  from
                  the virtual addressing space of your job.

                  If n is greater than 0, n represents the  total  number
                  of  blocks of core to be assigned to your job from this
                  point on.

                  If n is  less  than  the  high-segment  size  plus  the
                  minimum  low-segment size, n plus the high-segment size
                  is assumed.

                  x                  x is either K or P.  K represents units of 1024  words.
                  P   represents   512-word   pages.    For  example,  3P
                  represents three pages or 1536 words.  If  you  do  not
                  specify x, K is assumed.

        If you omit nx, the monitor prints the amount of  core  currently
        being  used  by  your job, as well as the octal page number, page
        (accessibility) status, and the origin of the pages.   This  form
        of the CORE command does not change the core assignment.

                  dev        Where:    dev:  is the name of the individual device on which the
                  file  is  to  be punched.  (For example, CDP2:  is card
                  punch number 2.) The device name is optional.  To punch
                  the  file  on  a  card  punch  at a different node, use
                  devSxx;, where xx is the node  number.   (For  example,
                  CDPS22:  is a card punch on node number 22.)

                  jobname                  jobname is the name of the job you  are  entering  into
                  the  queue.   The  default  job name is the name of the
                  first file in the request.

                  The equal sign is required if you  specify  either  the
                  device or job name.

                  file-spec                  file-spec is a single file specification or a string of
                  file specifications, separated by commas, for the files
                  being processed.  A file specification is in  the  form
                  dev:file.ext[directory].  (Refer to Section 1.9.)

                  If you specify neither a job name nor  a  file-spec,  a

                  /switches                  /switches are  listed  below.   The  switches  to  this
                  command  can  be divided into two categories, depending
                  on whether the switch can be used only once, or can  be
                  used  more  times, in a single command string.  The two
                  categories are:

                      Queue-Operation Switches                   o  Queue-Operation Switches

                      These switches can be used only once in  a  command
                      string.   They  affect  the entire request, and you
                      can place them anywhere in the command string.   If
                      you  have  used  one of these switches in a command
                      string, you cannot use it again in the same string.
                      Many  commands have a /NO construction, which takes
                      a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the  /NO
                      construction of a switch in the same command string
                      with the positive construction.

                      construction  of  a  switch  in  the  same  command
                      string.  To achieve a temporary or permanent effect
                      by the placement of the switch,  refer  to  Section

   Function   Function

        The CREF command runs the CREF program.  If you have created  any
        files  to  be  processed with CREF (using the /CREF switch with a
        COMPILE, LOAD, DEBUG, or EXECUTE command),  CREF  processes  them
        and  prints  them  on  the line printer.  The file containing the
        names of these CREF files is then deleted so that subsequent CREF
        commands will not list them again.

        When the logical device name LPT:  is assigned to a device  other
        than  the  line printer, the CREF files are stored on that device
        with the same file name and the extension .LST.   (See  the  CREF
        manual in the TOPS-10 Software Notebooks for more information.)

   Format   Format

        CREF file-spec

                  file-spec        Where:    file-spec is a valid  file  specification.   (Refer  to
                  Section  1.9.)  When you supply a file specification in
                  the command  line,  CREF  produces  a  cross-referenced
                  listing  file  for  the  specified file.  If you do not
                  give an argument to the command, CREF uses the argument
                  saved  from a previous COMPILE-class command.  If there
                  is no stored argument, CREF prompts  with  an  asterisk
                  (*).

        You can use the following switches with the CREF command.

   Function   Function

        The  CSTART  command  begins  executing  the  program  from   the
        beginning,  or  from  the  address  you  specify  in the command,
        leaving your terminal at monitor level.  The  CSTART  command  is
        the  same  as  the  START  command,  except  that  it leaves your
        terminal at monitor level.

                  it is other than the location specified within the file
                  (.JBSA).   If  you  do  not  specify  an  address,  the
                  starting  address  comes  from .JBSA (stored in the job
                  data area).

                  To use CSTART:

                  1.  Use LOAD or GET to bring a program into memory.

                  2.  Type one or two CTRL/Cs to halt your job with  your
                      terminal at monitor level.

                  3.  Type CSTART to begin running the program  from  the
                      beginning.

                  4.  You can now  type  additional  commands  from  your
                      terminal  if  they  do not require core, or you can
                      detach your terminal from the job, using the DETACH
                      command.

                                    NOTE

           The CSTART command allows the program to run from  the
           beginning  or  from  the  specified  address.   If the
           program requires terminal I/O, the program  will  wait
           until you access user level with the START or CONTINUE
           commands.  Then your terminal  can  accept  output  or
           provide input.

   Function   Function

        The DDT command starts DDT, the dynamic system debugger.  If  DDT
        is already loaded with your core image, DDT starts at the address
        given by the right half of .JBDDT in the Job Data Area.  (The Job
        Data  Area  stores  information  pertinent  to  your  job.  It is
                         _______ _______ _____ ______        described in the TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual.) If DDT is not yet
        loaded,  the  monitor  tries  to  merge  a special version of DDT
        (called VMDDT)  into  the  address  space  starting  at  location
        700000.

        If DDT is not yet loaded and the monitor cannot read in VMDDT, it
        prints  the  message:   ?NO  START ADDRESS.  The monitor will not
        read in VMDDT if your core image is execute-only.

        The DDT command copies  the  saved  program  counter  value  into
        .JBOPC  and  starts  the  program  at  an  alternate  entry point
        specified in .JBDDT (beginning address  of  DDT  as  set  by  the
        monitor).   DDT contains commands to allow you to start or resume
        at any desired address.

        If your job was executing a monitor  call  when  interrupted  (at
        monitor  level  and  not  in  TTY  input wait or SLEEP mode), the
        monitor sets a status bit (UTRP) and continues  the  job  at  the
        location  where  it  was  interrupted.   When  the  monitor  call
        processing is complete, the monitor clears the status  bit,  sets
        .JBOPC  to the address following the monitor call, and then traps
        to the DDT address found in .JBDDT.

        If your job is at monitor level and in TTY INPUT  WAIT  or  SLEEP
        mode,  the  trap to the DDT address occurs immediately and .JBOPC
        contains the address of the monitor call.  If your job is at user
        level, the trap also occurs immediately.  Therefore, it is always
        possible to continue the interrupted program  after  trapping  to
        DDT by executing a JRSTF @.JBOPC.

   Function   Function

        The DEALLOCATE command removes a volume set from your job's  list
        of  allocated  resources.   DEALLOCATE  implies a DISMOUNT of the
        specified resource.  The logical  name  for  the  volume  set  is
        cleared,  and  you  will  not be able to use that logical-name to
        refer to the volume set.

        DEALLOCATE has one switch:

        /HELP     Prints a short description  of  the  command.   If  you

        The following example shows the use of the ALLOCATE,  DEALLOCATE,
        MOUNT, DISMOUNT, and SHOW ALLOCATION commands.  The resources are
        reserved for a multivolume tape  volume  set  with  the  ALLOCATE
        command.  The name of the volume set is TAPE-SET, and it contains
        three volumes.  The logical name TS is assigned to the tape  set.
        The tape is write enabled, and it does not have standard labels.

        and clears the logical names associated with them.   If  you  are

        device, it is not returned to the system's pool unless  you  have
        issued a RELEASE or RESET monitor call; only the device's logical
        name is cleared.

                  specify this argument, the system deassigns all devices
                  from  your  job except your job's controlling terminal.
                  Also, the system clears any logical name that might  be

   Function   Function

        The DEBUG command compiles the specified source files, loads  the
        resulting  .REL  files  (if  necessary),  and prepares the loaded
        program for debugging.  A  system  debugging  program  is  loaded
        first,  followed  by your program, including local symbols.  Upon
        completion of  loading,  the  system  transfers  control  to  the
        debugging program.

        The debugging program that is used depends on the first  file  in
        the  command string.  If this file is a COBOL source file, COBDDT
        (the COBOL debugging program) is used.  If the file is a  FORTRAN
        source file, FORDDT is used.

        Generally, a program debugged with  the  DEBUG  command  requires
        more  core  to  execute  than  the same program compiled with the
        EXECUTE  command  requires.   Extra  space  is  occupied  by  the
        debugging  program  and additional debugging information, such as
        local symbols.

        Each time the system executes a COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, or  DEBUG
        command,  the  system  stores the command argument in a temporary
        file.  When you issue one of these  commands  without  arguments,
        the  system  uses  the  arguments  stored  in the temporary file.
        (Refer to Appendix C).  EXECUTE runs the COMPIL program before it
        runs the appropriate compiler and debugger.

        The following switches can be used to modify the command string:

                            the  disk  for  each  file compiled for later
                            processing by the  CREF  program.   The  file
                            extension  of  the  output file is .CRF.  The
                            file  can  then  be  listed  with  the   CREF
                            command.   However,  with  COBOL  files,  the
                            cross-referenced listing is  always  appended
                            to the listing file.  You must issue the CREF
                            command to obtain the listing.

        /DDT                Loads DDT and disregards the extension of the
                            first  file  in  the  command  string.   This
                            switch applies to all subsequent files.

        /FUDGE:file         Creates a disk file containing the  names  of
                            the   .REL  files  produced  by  the  command
                            string.  When the FUDGE switch is given,  PIP
                            reads  this  file  to generate a library .REL
                            file.    (Refer   to   the   FUDGE    command
                            description.)  The argument to this switch is
                            a valid file specification, as  described  in
                            Section 1.9.

        /GFLOAT             Indicates that double-precision  numbers  are
                            to  be  stored  in  G-floating  format.  This
                            format has an extended exponent range.   This
                            option is available on KL10 processors only.

        /K?10               Designates the processor  where  the  program
                            will execute after it has been loaded.  These
                            switches   are   necessary   for   FORTRAN-10
                            programs   because   the  compiler  generates
                            different  codes  for  different  processors.
                            The  default  is  the  processor  where  your
                            program is running.  The ?  can  be  replaced
                            by L or S.

        /LIBRARY            Loads the file in library search mode.   This
                            mode  causes  a  program  file  in  a special
                            library to be loaded only if one or  more  of
                            its   declared  entry  symbols  satisfies  an
                            undefined global request in the source  file.
                            The  system  libraries  are  always searched.
                            (See the LINK documentation.) /LIBRARY is the
                            same as /SEARCH.

        /LIST               Generates a disk listing file for  each  file
                            compiled.   The  file extension of the output
                            file is .LST.   These  files  can  be  listed
                            later  with  the  PRINT command.  If the line
                            printer is being spooled for  this  job,  the
                            listing files are written on device LPT:  and
                            are automatically spooled when you log out.

        /LMAP               Produces a  loader  map  during  the  loading
                            process that contains the local symbols.

        /LOADER             Obsolete

                            programs only.  This switch is not supported.

        /MAP:file           Produces a loader map  during  loading.   The
                            file  name  can be specified.  If the file is
                            not specified, the default is MAP.MAP.

        /NEW                Runs the appropriate language  compiler  from
                            the experimental system library (device NEW:)
                            area [1,5].  If the compiler does  not  exist
                            on  device  NEW:,  COMPIL  tries to obtain it
                            from device SYS:.

        /NOBIN              Does not generate binary files.  Binary files
                            are  generated  unless  you give this switch.
                            This switch, when combined with the /LIST  or
                            /CREF   switch,   is  useful  when  compiling
                            programs solely for the purpose of generating
                            a listing.

        /NOCOMPILE          Complement  to  the  /COMPILE  switch,   this
                            switch  does  not  force  a  compilation on a
                            source file whose date is not  as  recent  as
                            the  date  on  the  binary file.  This switch
                            differs from the  /REL  switch,  in  that  it
                            turns off all compilation, even if the source
                            file is newer than the .REL file.  /NOCOMPILE
                            is the default action.

        /NODEBUG            Does not pass arguments that were  previously

        /NOLIST             Does not generate listing files.  This is the

                            FORTRAN-40 programs only.  This switch is not
                            supported.

                            only   to   turn   off  library  search  mode
                            (/LIBRARY).   The  /NOSEARCH  default  is  to

                            OLD:), which resides on disk area [1,3].   If

                            files with the .PAS extension.

        /REL                Uses the existing .REL files  although  newer
                            source files might be present.

        /SAVE               Saves the core image of the loaded program.

                            action  is  identical to that of the /LIBRARY
                            switch.

        /SELF               Runs the appropriate language  compiler  from
                            device  DSK:   instead  of  from  the  system
                            library (device SYS:).  This switch is useful
                            if  you  keep a private copy of a compiler in
                            your own disk area.

        address.  Then type an uparrow (^)  to  see  the  previous  line,
        which  is  the  last line of program code.  Then type a line-feed
        (<LF>) to see the next line.  "PAT.." is on the next line.  Here,
        insert the call "JRST TEST," then exit DDT.

        Next, START the program:

        .START<RET>

        HI THERE - THIS IS A SIMPLE TEST PROGRAM!

        Then CONTINUE the program.  The execution is successful.

        The DECLARE command defines new monitor commands to run specified
        programs  for  your  job.   You  can  invoke  any  program with a
        user-defined command.  When you define  a  command,  the  monitor
        searches  your  command table and then the monitor command table.
        Exact definitions are  given  precedence.   An  exact  definition
        occurs  if  you  type  the complete, exact command name.  Inexact
        definitions occur when a command is abbreviated.   If  there  are
        conflicts  within  the  exact  definitions,  your definitions are
        given precedence.

        To use abbreviations  when  typing  a  command,  you  can  define
        "uniqueness"  for  a  command.  The monitor will behave as if the
        command had been given an exact definition.  If conflicts  arise,
        the monitor searches its own command table without searching your
        command table.

                       will run.  When  the  program  is  completed,  the
                       original  context  is  restored, and the temporary
                       context is destroyed.

        The DELETE command deletes files.  Because  of  protection  codes
        associated with files, it is not usually possible to delete files
        in another user's directory.  Once a file is deleted,  it  cannot
        be recovered.

                  If you do not specify a device name or a file structure

                  directory  becomes the default for all subsequent files
                  in that command line.  If you specify a directory  name

                  output file-spec =                  output file-spec = This argument and the equal sign are
                  optional.  If you omit the entire output specification,
                  the default is TTY:.  If you do not specify  an  output
                  device,  the  default  device  is  DSK:.  If you do not
                  specify an output file name, and  one  is  needed,  the
                  file  name is generated from the time of day as hhmmss.
                  The default output extension is .DIR.

        The full wildcard construction (* and/or ?) can be  used  in  the
        input  file-spec.  When a wildcard designation is used, DIRECTORY
        limits its search for the file to certain directories.  When  you
        give  a  wildcard  designation  for a file name or extension, the
        program only searches the specified  directory  or  your  default
        directory.   No  additional devices, such as LIB:  or SYS:, which
        might be in your default path, are searched.  (Refer  to  Section
                                                                  _______        1.14,  and  to  the  PATH monitor call description in the TOPS-10
        _______ _____ ______        Monitor Calls Manual, for information about directory paths.)

        If you use the wildcard construction in the directory name,  only
        the   directories   implied  by  the  wildcard  construction  are
        searched.  No additional directories are searched.

        The following  switches  can  be  used  in  the  command  string.
        Generally,  any switches can be used together in the same command
        string, unless the switches  contradict  one  another.   Switches
        that  precede the file name become the default for all succeeding
        files in the same command line.

        You can abbreviate switches as long  as  the  result  is  unique.
        This  is not recommended for batch control files.  Spaces are not
        permitted within a switch.


             Switch                            Function             Switch                            Function

        /ACCESS:n           Updates the access date  of  any  file  of  n
                            blocks  or less to the current date.  Because
                            some installations delete files that have not
                            been  recently  accessed,  this switch allows
                            you to prevent such deletion by updating  the
                            files.   n is a decimal number, and refers to
                            the number of  blocks  written  in  the  file
                            unless  the  /ALLOC  switch is also used.  If
                            you omit the /ACCESS switch, the system  does
                            not  change the date.  If you specify /ACCESS
                            but you omit :n, 5 is assumed.

        /ACCOUNT            Prints the account name associated with  that
                            file.  The account you are logged in under is
                            stored in the RIB of  all  files  created  or
                            superseded.

        /ALLOCATED          Lists  the  allocated  length  of  the   file
                            instead  of  the  written length.  Space on a
                            structure is sometimes allocated in units  of
                            more   than   one   block   for   efficiency.
                            Therefore, the number of blocks allocated  to
                            a  file  can  be  greater  than the number of
                            blocks actually written.  The LOGOUT  program
                            uses   the  allocated  length  when  checking
                            quotas.  The total allocated  length  of  all
                            files is the same as the length output by the
                            QUOLST  program  under   the   USED   column.
                            Normally,  when a file is created, the system
                            allocates 30 blocks for it.  Then the  system
                            deallocates unused blocks after file creation
                            is complete.  This switch is  the  complement
                            to the /WRITTEN switch.

        /ANYDEVICE          Searches all devices.

        /AUTHOR             Prints the project-programmer number  of  the
                            author of the file.

|       /BLOCKINGFACTOR:n   Sets the number of disk blocks per tape block
|                           read  from  tape.  The default value is 4 for
|                           compatability with tapes  written  by  BACKUP
|                           without   blocking-factor   capability.   The
|                           specified value must be in the range of 4  to
|                           96,  and must be a multiple of 4 disk blocks.
|                           Due to KS10 UNIBUS adapter  limitations,  the
|                           maximum blocking-factor on a KS10 is 56.

        /BLOCKS             Prints the length  of  the  file  in  blocks.
                            This is the default.  Complement to /WORDS.

        /CHECKSUM           Computes and prints an  18-bit  checksum  for
                            each  file.   This  checksum  is  computed by
                            rotating the  result  to  the  left  one  bit
                            before   adding  each  word.   Complement  to

        /COMPARE            Suppresses headers and  titles,  as  well  as
                            error messages in the output.  This makes the
                            output  file  suitable  for  comparison  with
                            another   file  (with  FILCOM).   Default  is

        /DENSITY:n          Uses the specified  density  when  reading  a
                            magnetic  tape.  n is 200, 556, 800, 1600, or
                            6250  bpi.   The  default  depends  on   your

        /FIND               Looks for the Find Files  for  the  directory
                            listing rather than the devices.  A Find File
                            is the binary output of a directory  listing,
                            and  is  created  with  the  /FNDBLD  switch.
                            /FIND   looks   for   the   Find   File    in
                            SYS:FNDDAT.FDF  or  .FPF.   You  can  use the

        /FNDBLD             Creates Find Files from the DIRECTORY output.
                            A  Find  File  is  the  binary  output from a
                            DIRECTORY listing.  Find Files are useful for
                            archiving  and  retrieving  files on magnetic
                            tape.  The file name of the Find File is that
                            specified  in the output specification of the
                            command format.  If you do  not  specify  the
                            output    file    name,    the   default   is
                            DSK:FNDDAT.FDF or .FPF.  The files can  later
                            be  accessed  with  the  /FIND  switch.   The

   Function   Function

        The DISMOUNT command relinquishes ownership of a device.  It does
        not  affect  your  allocation  requests,  if  you  have  used the
        ALLOCATE command, and you can MOUNT the device again.   Once  you
        have  dismounted  a  volume set, the device is available to other
        users.  However, if the  resource  was  not  allocated  with  the
        ALLOCATE command DISMOUNT performs an implicit DEALLOCATE.

        If you used the ALLOCATE command for the resource, the DISMOUNTed
        resource  remains  in  an  allocated  state  until  you issue the
        DEALLOCATE command.  Once you have dismounted a volume set,  your
        programs can no longer reference the resource by the logical name
        except with the MOUNT and DEALLOCATE commands.

                                            resource-name        Where:    For disk volume sets, the resource-name is  the  volume
                  set-name or the logical name.

                                            resource-name                  For tape volume sets, the resource-name is the  logical
                  name.

        You can use the following switches in the command string:

        /HELP          Prints a short description of the command.  If you
                       specify  any resource names with this switch, they
                       will be ignored.

        /NONOTIFY      Does not set the system to notify  your  job  when
                       the  dismount  is  complete.   This is the default
                       function if you have not specified /NOWAIT.

        /NOTIFY        Sets the  system  to  notify  your  job  when  the
                       dismount  is  complete.   If  you specify /NOWAIT,
                       this is the default function.

        /NOWAIT        Allows your job to return to monitor level  before
                       the dismount is complete.  This implies /NOTIFY.

        /REMOVE        Removes the specified  file  structure  from  your
                       job's search list.  If no other jobs are accessing

        2.  In this example, you knew that the job was the only one using
            the  structure  BLKJ:  and included a /REMOVE switch, so that
            the operator would remove the disk pack from the drive.   The
            message  "BLKJ  DISMOUNTED" means that BLKJ:  is no longer in
            your search list, and that a request has been queued  to  the
            operator to remove the pack from the drive.  The message does
            not mean that  BLKJ  has  already  been  physically  removed.
            Because  this  command  implies /NOWAIT, you will not receive
            notification of the physical removal of the disk pack.

            further  processing  until all pending dismount requests from
            it have been  completed.   There  were  no  pending  dismount
            requests  from  this job, so the job returns to monitor level

        The DSK command prints  disk  usage  figures  for  all  disk  I/O

        amount of disk I/O performed since the  job  was  started.   Disk
        usage is printed in the following format:

        RD,WT=m,n

                  i     j        Where:    i and j are the incremental number of  128-word  blocks

   Function   Function

        The EXECUTE command  compiles  the  specified  source  files,  if
        necessary,  loads  the  generated REL files into core, and begins
        execution of the  program.   The  system  determines  the  proper
        language  compiler to use from the source file extensions or from
        switches you specify  in  the  command  string.   (Refer  to  the
        COMPILE  command.)   If  a  .REL file already exists with a newer
        date than that of the source file, the system  does  not  compile
        the file unless you request this explicitly with a switch.

        This command is equal to issuing the LOAD and START commands.

        Each time you issue a COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, or  DEBUG  command,
        the  system  remembers  the  command  with  its  arguments  in  a
        temporary file on disk or in core.  Therefore, when you issue one
        of  these  commands  without specifying any arguments, the system
        uses the arguments that it saved in the temporary  file.   (Refer
        to Appendix C.)

        The EXECUTE command accepts several command constructions:  the @
        construction  (indirect  commands),  the  +  construction,  the =
        construction, and the < > construction.  Refer to Appendix C  for
        a complete description of each of these constructions.

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the
        command  before  running  the  appropriate  language compiler for
        LINK.

                  specification consists of a device name,  a  file  name
                  with  or  without  an  extension, and a directory name.

        /BINARY        Generates a binary file for  each  file  compiled.
                       The  file  name  for  the  binary file follows the
                       standard conventions for determining the  name  of
                       the  output file.  (Refer to the COMPILE command.)
                       The file name extension  is  .REL.   This  is  the
                       default action.

        /BLISS         Compiles the  file  with  BLISS-10.   Assumed  for
                       files  with  the  extension of .b10 or .bLI.  This
                       switch is not supported.

                       with the extension of .CBL.

        /COMPILE       Forces a compilation of this file even if a binary
                       file  exists  with  a newer date and time than the
                       source file.  You can use this switch to obtain an
                       extra   compilation  (for  example,  to  obtain  a
                       listing)  because  the  system  does  not  perform
                       compilation  if  the binary file is newer than the
                       source file.

        /CREF          Produces a cross-referenced listing  file  on  the
                       disk  for each file compiled, for later processing
                       by the CREF program.  The file  extension  of  the
                       output  file is .CRF.  You can then list the files
                       using  the  CREF  command.   However,  with  COBOL

                       Assumed  for  files  with the extension of .F4 and
                       .FOR and all files with  nonrecognizable  compiler
                       extensions  if  FORTRAN  is the standard compiler.
                       You need to specify this switch if the file has  a
                       nonrecognizable  compiler extension and FORTRAN is
                       not the standard compiler or is  not  the  current
                       default.   (For  example,  EXE/ALGOL  FIL1,  FIL2,
                       FIL3/FORTRAN).

        /FUDGE:        Creates a temporary file that contains   the names
         file-spec     of the .REL files produced by the  command  string
                       plus  the  library  file name.  When you issue the
                       FUDGE command, PIP reads this  temporary  file  to
                       generate a library .REL file.  (Refer to the FUDGE
                       command description.) The argument to this  switch
                       is:

                       dev:file.ext[proj,prog]

                               dev:                       Where:  dev:  is the device on which to write  the
                               file.   If you omit the device, the system
                               assumes DSK.

                               file.ext                               file.ext is the name of the library  file.
                               The  file  name  is required.  If you omit
                               the extension, the system assumes .REL.

                               [proj,prog]                               [proj,prog] is the directory in  which  to
                               place the file.  Your directory is assumed
                               if you do not specify a directory.

                       This switch is permanent  in  the  sense  that  it
                       pertains  to  all  .REL  files  generated  by  the
                       command string.

        /GFLOAT        Indicates that double-precision numbers are to  be
                       stored  in  G-floating format.  This format has an
                       extended exponent range.  This option is available
                       on KL-10 proessors only.

        /K?10          Designates the processor where  the  program  will
                       execute once it has been loaded.  The variable (?)
                       can be L or S.  These switches are  necessary  for
                       FORTRAN-10 programs because the compiler generates
                       different code for the processors.  The default is
                       the   processor  on  the  computer  executing  the

        /LIBRARY       Loads the files in library search mode.  This mode
                       causes a program file in a special library file to
                       be loaded only if one  or  more  of  its  declared
                       entry   symbols   satisfies  an  undefined  global

                       The  extension  of  the  output file is .LST.  The
                       system automatically spools it when you  log  out.
                       The complement of this switch is /NOLIST.

                       containing the local symbols.

        /MACY11        Assembles the file with MACY11.  Assumed for files
                       with  extensions  of  .P11.   This  switch  is not
                       supported.

        /MANTIS        Compiles   the   file   with   MANTIS    debugging
                       information.  This switch affects Fortran-40 files
                       only.  This switch is not supported.

        /MAP           Produces loader maps during the  loading  process.
                       When  this  switch is encountered, a loader map is
                       requested from  the  loader.   After  the  library
                       search of the system libraries, the map is written
                       in your  disk  area  with  either  the  file  name
                       specified  by  you (for example, /MAP:file) or the
                       default file name nnnLNK.MAP.  This switch  is  an
                       exception  to the permanent switch rule in that it
                       causes only one map to be produced even though  it
                       appears as a permanent switch.

                       (Refer to the Restriction.)

        /NOBINARY      Does not generate binary files.  Unless you  issue
                       this  switch,  the  system generates binary files.
                       This switch, when combined with the /CREF or /LIST
                       switch, is useful when you compile programs solely

                       the default action, this switch is  used  to  turn
                       off library search mode (/LIBRARY).

        /OLD           Runs the appropriate language  compiler  from  the

                       resides on the disk area [1,3].  If  the  compiler
                       does  not  exist  on  device OLD:, COMPIL tries to
                       obtain  it  from  device  SYS:.   (Refer  to   the

            command  requires  a  tape  identification  and  list of file
            specifications as arguments.   The  file  specifications  can
            include    an    explicit    file    structure    name    and
            project-programmer number so that you can copy files  from  a
            disk  area  other  than your own.  You do not have to specify
            the device and project-programmer number of  subsequent  file
            specifications  if  they  do  not  change.  That is, you must
            specify the programmer number (for example,  [,104])  if  the
            file  to  be  copied has the same project number as yours and
            you must specify  the  project  number  ([41,])  if  you  are
            copying files from another project.

            The protection of the disk file is checked to see if the file
            can  be  read.   In  addition,  the protection of the DECtape
            directory file (tape-id.DIR) is checked to  see  if  you  can
            update  it.   If  there  is not enough room on the DECtape to
            copy an entire file, that portion  (if  any)  that  has  been
            written  so  far is deleted and an error message is placed in
            the directory file.  When the files  have  been  successfully
            copied, an automatic FILE L is performed.

            When the wildcard construction is used with the  FILE  F  and
            FILE Z commands, your job's entire search list is used.  That
            is, all files matching the construction are transferred  from
            all structures in the search list.

            In  most  cases  you  do  not  need  to  specify  which  file
            structures  the  files  are on because UMOUNT determines this
            (with LOOKUPs) and passes the information  to  OMOUNT.   With
            the  FILE  F and FILE Z functions, if a file structure is not
            specified and the specified file  exists  on  more  than  one
            structure, the first one in your search list is copied.

        4.  FILE L,tape-id

            Reads the directory of a DECtape and writes it into your disk
            area  as  an  ASCII file with the file name tape-id.DIR.  The
            file is placed on  the  first  file  structure  that  can  be
            written on in your search list, as long as that structure has
            an area that matches your project-programmer number.  Tape-id
            is  a  1-  to  6-character  alphanumeric name that is used to
            identify the tape.  You can then print the directory on  your
            terminal  with  the  TYPE command.  The format of the DECtape
            directory is similar to the directory  file  written  by  the
            DIRECTORY command.  If errors occur while the FILE command is
            being processed, the system writes error  messages  into  the
            directory file tape-id.DIR.

                                FILE Command


        5.  File R,tape-id,dev:file.ext,dev:file.ext...

            Transfers the specified files from your DECtape to the  disk.
            This  command  requires  tape-id  and a list of file names as
            arguments.  If the specified files already exist in the  disk
            area,  they  are  superseded, if their protection code allows
            it.  If the specified files do not exist, they are created on
            the  first file structure in your job's search list for which
            creation is  permitted.   After  files  are  transferred,  an
            automatic FILE L is performed.

            If  you  have  a  search  list   containing   multiple   file
            structures,  the  asterisk  construction  (when used with the
            FILE R command) can cause files to  be  created  rather  than
            superseded.   For the FILE R function, when no file structure
            is specified, the  files  are  copied  onto  the  first  file
            structure  in  your  search  list on which you are allowed to
            create files.   (Refer  to  the  description  of  the  SETSRC
            program.)  When a file structure name is typed or implied, it
            becomes the new default.

        6.  FILE W

            Waits until all of your pending requests are processed before
            allowing   your  job  to  continue.   If  there  are  pending
            requests, the message "WAITING...  TYPE 2 ^C'S  TO  EXIT"  is
            printed  on  your terminal.  Control returns to your job when
            all requests have been processed.  You can type  two  CTRL/Cs
            if you decide not to wait.

        7.  FILE Z,tape-id,dev:file.ext[ppn],dev:file.ext[ppn]...

            Deletes the files in the directory of the DECtape before  the
            files are copied and then performs the same operations as the
            FILE F command.  This command requires tape-id and can have a
            list  of  file  specification arguments.  After the files are
            copied, an automatic FILE L is performed.

            When you use the wildcard construction with the  FILE  F  and
            FILE Z commands, your job's entire search list is used.  That
            is, all files matching the construction are transferred  from
            all structures in the search list.

                                FILE Command


        The wildcard constructions can be  used,  but  generic  DSK:  can
        define  many  file  structures;  the  specific  file structure is
        chosen as follows:

             When you use the wildcard construction for the file name  or
             extension,  the first structure in your search list that you
             can access is used.

             If you do not use the wildcard  construction  and  the  file
             exists,  the  first  file  structure in the search list that
             contains the specified file is used, unless overridden by  a
             default.   (Refer  to  the  examples.)  If the file does not
             exist, the standard structure is used.

   Examples   Examples

        In the following examples, your search list is as follows:

        SORT:,DSKA:/NOCREATE,DSKB:,DSKC:

        You are user 10,3421, with UFDs on DSKA:, DSKB:, and  DSKC:,  and
        the  file  EX.1  exists  on each of these three structures.  User
        10,4072 has the file EX.2 in his area on DSKB: and on DSKC:.

        1.  This command requests that the operator mount DECtape 1, that
            the  file  EX.1 in your area be copied onto it, that the file
            EX.2[10,4072]  also  be  copied  onto  the  DECtape,  that  a
            directory  of  the  DECtape be written in your area, and that
            the operator dismount the DECtape.

            The directory is written on the first  structure  encountered
            in  the  search  list  that is both writable and on which you
            have a UFD.  In the preceding example, you do not have a  UFD
            on  the  first  structure  in  your  search list (SORT:), you
            cannot create new files  on  the  second  structure  in  your
            search  list  (DSKA:), and so the directory is written on the
            third structure in your search list (DSKB:).

            The file EX.1 on DSKA: will be copied only onto  the  DECtape
            because  the  copy  on DSKA: was encountered first.  The file
            DSKB:EX.2[10,4072] will be copied onto  the  DECtape  because
            the copy on DSKB: was encountered first.

        2.  In this example, you specified that DSKC: be copied from both
            areas.  DSKC: was typed only once because a device given in a
            file specification remains  in  effect  for  subsequent  file
            specifications  in the same command, unless another device is
            specified.  When you omit the project number the  default  is
            your  project-programmer number.  Also the project-programmer
            number can be specified either before the file  name  (as  in
            this  example)  or  after  the file name (as in the preceding

            Z  command  for  determining the device on which to write the
            directory.  The file  EX.1  is  written  on  the  first  file
            structure  in your search list.  The file EX.1 already exists
            on DSKA:, DSKB:, and DSKC:.  DSKA: is NOCREATE, so  the  file
            EX.1  is  written  onto DSKB, superseding the EX.1 already on

        The FINISH command terminates any input or  output  currently  in

        deassigns the device.  This command  completely  disassociates  a
        device  from  your  job  and  prevents  you  from  continuing the
        program.  If you want to continue your program after ending  I/O,

   Function   Function

        The FUDGE command creates a library .REL file  from  a  temporary
        file  generated  by  a  previous COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, or DEBUG
                                                                  _______        command string containing the /FUDGE switch.   (See  the  TOPS-10

        ______        Manual for descriptions of library .REL files.)

        The temporary file contains the library name and the list of .REL
        files which were entered by the previous command's /FUDGE switch.
        The FUDGE command runs PIP, which reads the list  of  .REL  files
        and  the  library  file  name  from the temporary file.  PIP then
        copies the listed .REL files into the library file  in  the  same
        order that they are listed in the temporary file.

                                    NOTE

           Unlike the COMPIL program's default action, the /FUDGE
           switch  combines files in the order that you list them
           in the command line.  The COMPIL program  sorts  files
           by  compilers.   COMPIL  sorts mixed FORTRAN and MACRO
           programs so that all  FORTRAN  programs  are  compiled
           first and MACRO programs second.

        After you use the /FUDGE switch, you must issue the FUDGE command
        before  you  issue  any other command that runs PIP (for example,
        TYPE and  COPY).   Otherwise,  the  library  information  in  the
        temporary file will be superseded by the information generated by

   Function   Function

        The GET command loads a core image  from  a  retrievable  storage
        device but does not execute it.

        This command clears all of your core.  However,  programs  should
        not  count on this action and should explicitly clear those areas
        of core that are expected to contain zeros.  (That  is,  programs
        should  be self-initializing).  This action allows programs to be
        restarted by a CTRL/C START sequence without another GET command.

        GET file-spec core/switch

                  file-spec        Where:    file-spec is  a  file  specification  in  the  standard
                  format.

                  core                  core is the amount of core you want to reserve for  the
                  program.    The  core  argument  is  a  decimal  number
                  followed by an optional K or P  for  blocks  or  pages,
                  respectively.   If  you do not specify either K or P, K
                  is assumed.  If you do not specify a core argument, the
                  default  is  the  minimum amount of core needed to load
                  the program.

                  /switch                  /switch is the following option:

                                 section numbers are 0-37, octal.   (Note
                                 that the limit is 40 octal sections.)

|       Because of the 6-character limit on file names, some of the  help
|       file  names  can  be  cryptic.   The  file names for the commands
|       topics are fairly  straightforward  and,  although  truncated  to
|       6-characters, can be understood. (For example, PASSWO is the help
|       file for the PASSWORD command.)  However, help files are provided
|       for  such  general  topics as line continuation (LNCONT), command
|       switches (COMSWI), and directory  paths  (DIRPAT)  and  the  file
|       names  for  these  topics  may  be difficult to ascertain.  These

        designated terminals.  You can reissue the command at  any  time.
        This  command  also  starts  certain system programs, when issued
        from particular terminals.

        If you are logged in  and  you  run  INITIA,  INITIA  reads  your
        SWITCH.INI  file.   Refer  to  Appendix  B  for  a description of
        SWITCH.INI.

                            attributes.   The SETTTY argument is required
                            in order to set terminal characteristics from
                            SWITCH.INI  if  you  are logged in.  When you
                            are not  logged  in,  INITIA  reads  terminal

        In addition to the above arguments, you  can  use  the  following
        arguments  to  INITIA  SETTTY  in your SWITCH.INI file.  They are
        effective for any job that is logged in.  Most of  the  following
        arguments  are  equivalent  to  an argument to a SET TTY command.
        Many of the arguments can be  preceded  by  NO  and  a  space  to
        disable  the  defaults.  These are included in the description of
        the function of the arguments.  (Refer to Appendix B for  details
        about using SWITCH.INI.)

                       keywords for /HELP are SWITCHES  and  TEXT.   TEXT
                       prints  the help file and is the default argument.
                       SWITCHES  lists  the  KJOB  switches   and   their
                       meanings.

        /MESSAGE:key   Tells the system which messages to print  on  your

                       standard LOGOUT message but still prints error and
                       warning messages.  The keywords for /MESSAGE are:

                       ADDRESS        Prints out the  address  where  the
                                      message occurs.

                       CONTINUATION   Prints out  continuation  text,  if
                                      any.

                       FIRST          Prints out the first  line  of  the
                                      message.

                       PREFIX         Prints   out   the    six-character

        /TEMP          Searches your disk area and deletes all files with
                       .TMP  extensions.   TEMP  is  a default switch for
                       KJOB.  Using the NOTEMP switch will  log  you  out
                       faster.

   KJOB/BATCH Algorithm   KJOB/BATCH Algorithm

        The KJOB/BATCH  algorithm  categorizes  files  in  three  groups,
        according to their extensions:

         o  Expendable files have these extensions:

            TMP, TEM, SFD, BAK, Q??, MAP, CRF, LSD, LSQ, LST,  LIS,  LPT,
            PTP, PLT, CDP, Z??, FOO, LOG, BIN, DMP, FIN

         o  Important files have these extensions:

            RNO, RND, RNH, CMD, KBD, CED, MCR, SNO, FAI, FOR,  F4,   MAC,
            ALG,  AID,  BLI, B10, B11, COB, CBL, BAS, PAL, P11, SRC, IDA,
            IDX, DAT, DBS, B16, B32, B36, REQ, R16, R36, PAS, INI

         o  Unimportant files have other extensions.

        Files are deleted in the following order until the user is  under
        quota:

        1.  Recompute disk usage and delete files that are too large.

            The number of blocks used is recalculated by doing a wildcard
            directory and adding up the total space used.  Any files that
            are larger than the logged-out quota are deleted.

        2.  Delete unprotected expendable files.

            An individual wildcard directory search is performed for each
            of  the extensions listed in the expendable list.  If a match
            is found and the protection code is less  than  or  equal  to
            177, the file is deleted.

        3.  Delete unprotected unimportant files.

            Files with extensions that are NOT in the important list  and
            that  have  a  protection  code less than or equal to 177 are
            deleted.

        4.  Delete remaining expendable files.

            An individual wildcard directory search is performed for each
            of  the extensions listed in the expendable list.  If a match
            is found, the file is deleted, no matter how it is protected.

        5.  Delete unprotected important files.

            An individual wildcard directory search is performed for each
            of  the  extensions listed in the important list.  If a match
            is found and the protection code is less  than  or  equal  to
            177, the file is deleted.

            Notice that the extensions toward the end  of  the  important
            list  are  considered  to be more important than those toward
            the beginning of the list.

        6.  Delete all unimportant files.

            Files with extensions that are NOT in the important list  are
            deleted no matter what their protection codes.

        7.  Delete all files.

   Function   Function

        The LABEL command writes  an  identifier  onto  a  DECtape.   The
        identifier  is  stored on the tape itself and is printed when you
        print a directory of the  tape  with  the  DIRECT  command.   You
        should  assign  a unique label to each DECtape to avoid confusing
        one tape with another.  You must use the ASSIGN command to access
        the tape before you can use LABEL.

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the
        command before running PIP.

   Function   Function

        The LIST command prints one or more files  on  the  line  printer
        (LPT:).   The  output goes either to the line printer immediately
        or to the disk to be spooled to the  line  printer  if  the  line
        printer  is  being spooled for this job.  (Refer to the QUEUE and
        PRINT commands.) If the line printer is being spooled, the  PRINT
        command  is preferred over the LIST command because it saves time
        and disk accesses.

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the
        command before running PIP.

                  file   specifications  separated  by  commas.   A  file
                  specification consists of a device name,  a  file  name
                  and  extension, and a directory name.  This argument is
                  required.  When a  directory  name  precedes  the  file
                  name, it becomes the default for all succeeding files.

                  Switches can be passed to  PIP  by  enclosing  them  in
                  parentheses  in  the  LIST command string.  When COMPIL

   Function   Function

        The  LOAD  command  translates  the  specified  source  files  if
        necessary,  runs  the  loader, and loads the generated .REL files
        into memory.  The appropriate language compiler is determined  by
        the  source  file extension or by switches in the command string.
        (Refer to the COMPILE command.) If a  .REL  file  already  exists
        with a more recent date than that of the source file, compilation
        is not performed  (unless  you  request  it  using  the  /COMPILE
        switch).

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the
        command  before  running  the  appropriate  language compiler and
        linking loader.

        The LOAD command generates  a  core  image  but  does  not  begin
        executing  the  program.   After  the LOAD command, you can START
        your program or SAVE the core image for future execution.

        Each time  the  COMPILE,  LOAD,  EXECUTE,  or  DEBUG  command  is
        executed,  the  system  remembers  the  arguments  and  switches.
        Therefore, if you issue one of these commands with no  arguments,
        the system uses the stored arguments.

        The LOAD command accepts several command  constructions:   the  @
        construction  (indirect  commands),  the  +  construction,  the =
        construction, and the < > construction.  (Refer to Appendix C for
        a complete description of each of these constructions.)

                  name, a file name with or without an extension,  and  a
                  directory name.  (Refer to Section 1.9.)

                         This  switch  is  used  to   obtain   an   extra

                         extensions.   This  switch  is  necessary if the
                         file has a nonstandard  compiler  extension  and
                         FORTRAN  is  not the standard compiler or is not

        /FUDGE:          Creates  a disk file containing the names of the
         file-spec       .REL files produced by the command string.  When
                         you  give the FUDGE command, PIP reads this file
                         to generate a library REL file.  (Refer  to  the
                         FUDGE command description.)  The argument to the
                         switch is:

                                      write  the  file.   If you omit the
                                      device name, DSK:  is assumed.

                                      file.   The  file name is required.
                                      If you omit the  extension,  it  is
                                      assumed to be .REL.

                                      which  to  place  the  file.   Your
                                      default directory number is assumed

                         This switch is permanent in that it pertains  to
                         all .REL files generated by the command string.

        /GFLOAT          Indicates that double-precision numbers  are  to
                         be stored in G-floating format.  This format has
                         an extended  exponent  range.   This  option  is
                         available on KL10 processors only.

                         execute  once it has been loaded.  The ?  can be
                         replaced by L or S.

        /LIBRARY         Loads the files in library  search  mode.   This
                         mode causes a program in a special library to be
                         loaded only if one or more of its declared entry
                         symbols satisfies an undefined global request in
                         the source  file.   The  default  libraries  are
                         always    searched.     (Refer   to   the   LINK

        /LIST            Generates a disk  listing  file  for  each  file

                         is .LST.  These files can be listed  later  with
                         the PRINT command.  If the line printer is being
                         spooled   for   this   job,   the   files    are
                         automatically  printed.   If  you do not specify

                         is written in your disk  area  with  either  the

                         [1,5].  If the compiler does not exist on device
                         NEW:,  COMPIL  tries  to  obtain  it from device
                         SYS:.  (Refer to Restriction.)

        /NOBINARY        Does not generate binary  files.   This  switch,
                         when combined with the /CREF or /LIST switch, is
                         useful when compiling programs only to  generate
                         listings.

        /NOCOMPILE       Does not force a compilation of  a  source  file

                         binary file.  Note that this switch is  not  the
                         same  as  the  /REL  switch, which turns off all
                         compilation, even if the source  file  is  newer
                         than  the  .REL file.  /NOCOMPILE is the default

        The LOCATE command changes the default device list  of  the  job,
        making  devices at other ANF-10 nodes available to your job.  For
        example, if you want to use the devices at node  FRATZ  for  your
        job, you can issue the following command:

        .LOCATE FRATZ

        Thereafter, the default I/O devices used will be  those  on  node
        FRATZ.   Note that terminal and disk I/O are not affected by this
        command.

        The LOCATE command does not change the location of your job;  the
        job runs on the node on which the job was started.

                  which you want I/O to be processed.

                  An argument of 0 locates your job at the node where the
                  job's  command  interpreter  is.  If you do not specify

        after typing LOGIN, followed by a space.  After it receives  this
        information,  LOGIN  prints  another  prompt  (PASSWORD:) on your
        terminal.  Type your password, and press  RETURN.   The  password
        does not echo on your terminal.  You are finished logging in when
        the monitor prompt (a period) is returned.

        Your system may be running account validation software.  In  this
        case, LOGIN may not be complete after you type your password.  If
        your job requires an account string, LOGIN prompts you  for  your
        account  (ACCOUNT:).   Type  your  account string, and then press
        RETURN, or just press RETURN  if  the  system  administrator  has
        established a default account for your job.  If your job requires
        a remark string, LOGIN prompts for it (REMARK:).   Here  you  can
        type anything that will identify your job.  Your remark can be up
        to 39 characters.  If you do not have  a  remark,  press  RETURN.
        The  system  records spaces for your remark.  Example 3 shows the
        procedure for logging in with account validation software.

                                      NOTE

                When the account string is validated,  characters
                are  checked  according  to case.  Therefore, you
                must  type  your  account  in   the   same   case
                (uppercase or lowercase) as it is required.  This
                aspect of the system can be changed by the system
                administrator.

        You can put your account string and  remark  in  your  SWITCH.INI
        file.  See Appendix B for further information.

        To  specify  a  default  path  for  disk  I/O,  type   the   path
        specification  instead of your project-programmer number.  A path
        specification more specifically identifies your  directory  area.
        It   specifies   either  a  user-file  directory  or  a  sub-file
        directory.  Refer  to  Section  1.14  of  this  manual  for  more
        information about path specifications.

        If you have detached your terminal from a job, and begin  to  log
        in  to  another job, the LOGIN program asks if you want to attach
        to the old job or  create  a  new  job.   For  information  about
        detaching and attaching jobs, see the ATTACH and DETACH commands.
        Example 2 shows the procedure for logging in to a new  job  after
        detaching the first.

                  identification        Where:    identification       represents       either       your
                  project-programmer  number  (PPN),  path  specification
                  ([directory]), or your user name.

        You can type a path specification in place of  the  PPN  or  user
        name.   This allows you to establish a default directory path for
        the job.  The path specification is either a user-file  directory
        or  a  sub-file  directory.   Directory  paths  are  enclosed  in
        brackets (for example:  [27,5434,SFD]).

        The following switches modify the command string.  These switches
        can  be  included  in your SWITCH.INI file.  SWITCH.INI files are
        discussed in Appendix B.

        Most parameters set by these switches can be changed  by  monitor
        commands  after  you  log in.  (Refer to the SET commands and the

                            the  default  action.   By  default,   if   a
                            detached  job  exists with the specified PPN,
                            and the job was logged in  with  /ATTACH:ASK,
                            LOGIN  asks whether you want to attach to the
                            detached job, instead of creating a  new  job
                            with the same PPN.  The /ATTACH:IGNORE switch
                            suppresses  the   default   action   of   the
                            /ATTACH:ASK switch.  Jobs you create with the
                            IGNORE argument will be ignored by LOGIN when
                            you  do  additional logins with the same PPN.
                            LOGIN will not ask you if you want to  attach
                            to jobs set to the IGNORE argument.

        /NOSCAN             Cancels the /SCAN switch  for  the  directory
                            path.   When  scanning  is  set,  the  system
                            searches  for  files   through   the   entire
                            directory    path.    Directory   paths   are
                            described  in  Section  1.14.   This   switch
                            disables scanning.  Thus, the system will not
                            search for files past the specified directory
                            area.    (Refer   to   the   SETSRC   program

                            in your SWITCH.INI file.  The default  action
                            is   that  LOGIN  reads  SWITCH.INI,  setting
                            terminal   characteristics    according    to
                            switches  specified in the LOGIN line.  Refer

                            /PASSWORD  on  your account, so that when you
                            log  in,  you  will  have  to   change   your

        /PATH:[dir]         Specifies a default path for disk I/O.  Refer
                            to Section 1.14 for further information.

        /PHYSICAL:nx        Sets the maximum physical page limit of  your
                            job.  The value n is any decimal number.  The
                            value x is either K (for 1024-word blocks) or
                            P  (for  512-word pages).  You can use either
                            /LIMIT  or  /GUIDELINE  with  the   /PHYSICAL
                            switch.  The default is /GUIDELINE.  Refer to
                            the SET PHYSICAL command.

        /QUOTA:             Recomputes the disk quota for  the  specified
         (str1,str2,...)    structures.  If  you  specify  more than  one
         ALL                structure,  you  must  separate the structure
         DSK                names with commas, and enclose  the  list  in
                            parentheses.   However,  if  you specify only
                            one  structure,  the  parentheses   are   not
                            required.   If you specify no structures, all
                            the structures in your job's search list  are
                            assumed.  Instead of (str1,str2,...), you can
                            use  ALL  or  DSK.   ALL   expands   to   all
                            structures in the system.  DSK expands to all
                            structures in your search list.

        /REMARK:"text"      Specifies a remark string for your  job.   If
                            you  include  non-alphanumeric  characters in
                            the remark, you must enclose  the  remark  in
                            quotation marks.

        /RUN:file-spec      Runs the specified program immediately  after
                            LOGIN,   unless   another  program  has  been
                            designated by the system manager.

        /SCAN               Sets the /SCAN switch for the directory path.
                            When  /SCAN is specified, scanning is enabled
                            for  the  directory  path.   Scanning  allows
                            searches  to  be  made  through  the complete
                            path.  If  scanning  is  disabled,  only  the
                            first  directory  is searched.  (Refer to the
                            SETSRC program.)

        /SPOOL:dev or       Adds the  specified  device(s) to the current
        /SPOOL:(dev1,...)   list of  those spooled for the job.  Spooling
           or               is  the  mechanism by  which  I/O to  or from
        /SPOOL:ALL          slow-speed  devices  is  simulated  on  disk.

                            when it becomes available.  These devices can
                            be spooled:  the  line  printer  (LPT:),  the
                            card  punch  (CDP:),  the card reader (CDR:),
                            the paper-tape punch (PTP:), and the  plotter
                            (PLT:).

        /STR                Causes  all  files  in  the  standard  system
                            library  [1,4]  with  name  ???STR.TXT  to be
                            printed  on  your  terminal.    Assume,   for
                            example,  that  there  is  a  file on private
                            structure "PR:" called PRLSTR.TXT[1,4]  which
                            says:   "PR:PAYROLL  DEBUG  PACK  -- NOT REAL
                            DATA".  Any user who logged in with /STR  (or
                            had  /STR  in his SWITCH.INI file) would have
                            the warning message printed on his terminal.

        /SYS                Adds  the  SYS:  structure   to   your   DSK:
                            specification.   Consequently,  if  a file is
                            not found in the directories in  your  search
                            list  or  in your library directory (if /LIB:
                            [proj,prog] has been specified),  the  system
                            directory [1,4] will then be searched for the

        /TIME:n             Sets a central  processor  time  limit  of  n
                            seconds  for  a  job.  When the time limit is
                            reached, the system stops the job and  prints
                            a   message.    A   timesharing  job  can  be
                            continued by typing CONTINUE, but unless  the
                            time  is  reset with the SET TIME command, no
                            time limit will be in effect.   A  batch  job
                            cannot be continued.

        /VIRTUAL:n          Specifies the current virtual page limit,  as
                            represented  by  n.   (For  a  description of
                            CVPL,   see   the   TOPS-10   Monitor   Calls

                            represents a block, and P a page;  1K  equals
                            1024  words, and 1P equals 512 words.  If you
                            type neither letter, K is assumed.  K can  be
                            specified within the range 1 to 512P.  If you
                            type /VIRTUAL:0, the value of CVPL, as set by

        NOCRLF              at the end of each line.  The width  of  this
                            line  is  set  with WIDTH.  NOCRLF suppresses
                            the automatic carriage-return/line-feed.  The
                            default is CRLF.

        DEFER               Suppresses echoing of the characters you type
        NODEFER             until output to  the  terminal  is  finished.
                            For  example,  when  the  system  is  sending
                            output to your terminal and you type  another
                            command,  the system will echo the characters
                            as it is printing output  on  your  terminal.
                            DEFER holds the characters you type until the
                            output is finished.  NODEFER is  the  default
                            setting.    For   video   terminals,   it  is
                            recommended that you set DEFER.

        DISPLAY             Informs  the system  that  you have a display
        NODISPLAY           terminal.   Your  programs   can   use   this
                            information   when  sending  output  to  your
                            terminal.  NO DISPLAY turns off  the  DISPLAY
                            function.

        ECHO                Prints  the  characters   you  type  on  your
        NOECHO              terminal.  This puts your  terminal  in  full
                            duplex  mode.   NOECHO  puts your terminal in
                            half duplex mode.  That  is,  the  characters
                            you type are not printed on your terminal.

        FILL:n              Controls  the filler class of  the  terminal.
        NOFILL              This effects the output of filler characters.
                            NOFILL is the equivalent to FILL:0.

        LC                  Allows   the   system   to   print  lowercase
        NOLC                characters  on  your  terminal  when  echoing
                            characters from your terminal.  This argument
                            is used  on  terminals  that  have  lowercase
                            ability   but   are  not  printing  lowercase
                            characters.  NOLC makes the system  translate
                            all input characters to uppercase as they are
                            transmitted.

        LENGTH:n            Sets the terminal page length to n lines.

        RCVSPEED:nnnn       Sets the speed at which  your  terminal  will
                            receive characters to n baud.

        RTCOMP              Controls  the function of CTRL/R  and CTRL/T.

                            this  way,  which  is useful when you plan to
                            run a program that uses CTRL/R and CTRL/T for
                            other purposes.

        NOSBELL             automatically    by    the   system.  NOSBELL
                            suppresses  the  terminal bell when output is
                            stopped automatically by the system.

        SPEED:nnnn          Sets the receiving and transmitting speed  of
                            your terminal to n baud.

        SSTOP:n             Sets the terminal  to  stop  output  after  n
                            lines,  where  n  is  page  length,  ignoring
                            intermittent <CTRL/Q>s.

                            your  terminal  does not have tab stops.  The
                            system will then simulate tab stops for  your

                            of  CTRL/S  and  CTRL/Q  to control the paper
                            tape.  NOTAPE restores the function of CTRL/S

        2.  The following example illustrates the process of detaching  a
            job,  logging  in  a second job, detaching the second job and
            logging in a third  job.   First,  detach  the  job  that  is
            currently running:

            .DETACH<RET>
            FROM JOB 52

            When you log in, if you have a detached job (logged  in  with
            /ATTACH:ASK),  LOGIN prompts you whether you want to log in a
            new job or attach to the existing  job.   (To  suppress  this
            function,  use the /ATTACH:IGNORE switch when you log in.) To
            log in a new job at this point, type NO and press RETURN.  If
            you  type  YES  or  just  press RETURN, your terminal will be
            attached to the existing job.

            Detaching a job is useful when you are running a program  you
            expect  to  run for a long time.  If you want to allow such a
            program  to  run,  while  you  start  another  job,  use  the
            CCONTINUE  command.  For example, start a DIRECTORY search of
            SYS:

            .DIRECT EXEVER.SYS=SYS:*.EXE/PRVERSION<RET>
            ^C
            ^C
            .CCONTINUE<RET>

            The DIRECT program continues to  search  for  files  in  SYS:
            with  the  extension  .EXE,  and  stores  them in EXEVER.SYS.
            Meanwhile, you can log in a third job.

            To log in a third job, first detach the second:

   Function   Function

        The MAKE command creates a new file on the disk with  TECO  (Text
        Editor  and  Corrector).   If a file already exists with the same
        name, the system prints  a  warning  message.   If  you  continue
        despite this warning, the system program supersedes the file.  If
        you type two CTRL/Cs to leave TECO, the program does not  destroy
        the   file.   (See  the  TECO  manual  in  the  TOPS-10  Software
        Notebooks.)

   Function   Function

        MIC allows you to create a new command  by  writing  any  desired
        sequence  of  monitor-mode and user-mode commands in a disk file.
        MIC commands are discussed in  the  file  DOC:MICV2.DOC,  on  the
        system.  MIC is not a supported product.

        You may include any of the following commands in your MIC command
        file, along with any number of monitor commands.

   Commands   Commands

        BACKTO     Specifies a 1- to 6-  character  label  at  which  MIC
                   processing  is  to  resume.   Note  that labels in MIC
                   command files are terminated by ::  and must be at the
                   beginning of a line.

        ERROR/     Specifies  a character that is used to denote an error
        NOERROR    condition when displayed at the beginning of a line.

        GOTO       Specifies a 1- to 6-  character  label  at  which  MIC
                   processing  is  to  resume.   Note  that labels in MIC
                   command files are terminated by ::  and must be at the
                   beginning of a line.

        IF         Conditionally processes a monitor command.

        LET        Allows you to change the value of any user  parameters
                   in  a  MIC  file.   For  example,  LET  C= "THIS IS C"
                   substitutes the text within double quotes as the value
                   of C.

        MIC Arg    Allows you to ABORT, SUSPEND, CANCEL, RETURN, or  EXIT
                   from MIC processing.

        OPERATOR/  Specifies   one  ASCII  character  to  be  treated  as
        NOOPERATOR introducing a line that requires user attention.   For
                   example, if the operator character is output in column
                   1, MIC suspends output and  displays  [BREAK].   After
                   this,  type  the  requested  information.   Then  type
                   CTRL/P (PROCEED), which will continue  the  processing
                   of the command file.

                                MIC Commands


        SILENCE/   Suppresses   and   resumes  output  to  the  terminal.
        REVIVE     You can type another monitor command on the same  line
                   as the SILENCE/REVIVE command.  For example,

                        .REVIVE.DIR<RET>

                   causes terminal output to be revived  after  the  .DIR
                   command  has  been  typed.  Therefore, only the output
                   from the .DIR command will be printed on the terminal.

        WHENEVER/  Changes  the  default  action  whenever  a  particular
        ON         action  or  event  occurs.   ON   and   WHENEVER   are
                   equivalent commands.

   Function   Function

        The MOUNT command requests ownership of a device.  Because  MOUNT
        calls  for  action  by  the operator, the command is not complete
        (the monitor prompt is not printed on your  terminal)  until  the
        operator  has mounted the device.  If more than one volume in the
        volume set must be mounted at one time, the system  ensures  that
        the  resources  will  be available.  Volumes that must be mounted
        sequentially,  such  as  tape  volume  sets,  will   be   mounted
        automatically.   Therefore,  you  use  MOUNT  only  once for each
        volume set.

        Resources are pre-allocated to a job using the ALLOCATE  command.
        This  informs  the system of your future need for a resource.  If
        you use the MOUNT command without previously using  the  ALLOCATE
        command  for  the  same resource, MOUNT allocates the resource as
        well as mounting it.  Note,  however,  that  the  implicit  MOUNT
        allocation  is  cancelled  when  you use DISMOUNT.  An explicitly
        allocated resource remains your property until you use DEALLOCATE
        to relinquish it.

        You can use MOUNT to assign a logical name to a resource.  A tape
        volume set must always have a logical name.  Therefore, if you do
        not assign a logical name when  you  allocate  or  mount  a  tape
        volume   set,   the   system  uses  the  first  six  alphanumeric
        characters, or up to the first non-alphanumeric character, as the
        default logical name.

                               MOUNT Command


                  Note that a tape mount request must  include  a  volume
                  identification.   This is accomplished by including the
                  volume identifier in the resource name, or by using the
                  /SCRATCH, /VOLID or /REELID switch in the command line.

                  log-name                  log-name is the logical name you assign to  the  device
                  that  you  will  use.   The logical name can be up to 6
                  alphanumeric characters.  The logical name is optional.
                  Disk volume sets do not require a logical name, but you
                  can assign one.  Tape volume sets must have  a  logical
                  name.   If  you  do not assign a logical name to a tape
                  volume set, the default logical name  will  be  derived
                  from   the   volume  set  name,  using  the  first  six
                  characters,  or  up  to  the   first   non-alphanumeric
                  character.

        If you assigned a logical name  to  the  resource  by  using  the
        ALLOCATE command, you can mount the device by typing:

        MOUNT log-name/switch/switch...

        Any switches that you specified in a previous  ALLOCATE  command,
        using the same resource name, become effective when you MOUNT the
        resource.  However, you cannot specify any switches with MOUNT to
        change the switches you specified in the ALLOCATE command.  Also,
        you cannot specify any further switches with the  MOUNT  command,
        except  for non-status-setting switches such as /REMARK.  This is
        because defaults are assumed when the request is ALLOCATEd.

                                      NOTE

                To MOUNT more than one device at a time, separate
                the volume set identifications with a comma (,).

        You can obtain a list of all the requests in the mount  queue  by
        typing MOUNT with no arguments or switches.

        The following is a list of the switches you can use  with  MOUNT.
        Some  switches  apply  to  both  tape and disk volume sets, other
        switches apply to one or the other.  The center column  indicates
        the kind of volume set the switch applies to.

        /DENSITY:n-BPI  Tape     Specifies    the    recording    density
                                 (bits-per-inch)  of the volume set.  The

                                           may have  user  labels.   When
                                           the  end-of-tape  is  reached,
                                           the user is notified.  This is
                                           useful  for  programs  such as

                                 specified structure.

        /READ-ONLY      Tape     Specifies that you will not write on the
                        Disk     volume set.  Tape volume  sets  will  be
                                 checked  as  they are mounted, to ensure
                                 that they are not  write-enabled.   This
                                 is the default for tape volume sets.

                                 On disk volume sets,  the  monitor  will
                                 not update access dates.  If you specify

                                 the   system.    This   is  the  default
                                 function.  This switch is the complement
                                 to /NOWAIT.

                                 checks  each volume as it is mounted, to
                                 be sure that it is write-enabled.   This
                                 is  the default function for disk volume

        The following example shows the use of the ALLOCATE,  DEALLOCATE,
        MOUNT, DISMOUNT, and SHOW ALLOCATION commands.  The resources are
        reserved for a multivolume tape  volume  set  with  the  ALLOCATE
        command.  The name of the volume set is TAPE-SET, and it contains
        three volumes.  The logical name TS is assigned to the tape  set.
        The tape is write enabled, and it does not have standard labels.

   Function   Function

        The NETWORK command prints information  about  the  nodes  in  an
        ANF-10  and/or DECnet-10 network environment.  Your terminal must
        be attached to one of the  nodes  in  the  network  to  use  this
        command.   You  can use the NETWORK command to obtain information
        about the other nodes in either type of network,  and  about  the
        device configuration of each node in the ANF-10 network.

        You can specify  the  node-name  or  node-number  in  the  ANF-10
        network, or just node-name in the DECnet-10 network, to limit the
        output to specific nodes.  You can use  switches  to  change  the
        output format.

        NETWORK reads your SWITCH.INI file and accepts indirect commands.
        The indirect command files should be formatted as follows:

        node-list/switch/switch...

        Indirect command files are discussed in Appendix C.

   Formats   Formats

        NETWORK node-list/switch

                  node-list        Where:    node-list is the node-names or  node-numbers  (ANF-10),
                  or  just node-names (DECnet-10), of nodes for which you
                  want information.  If you do not specify the node-list,
                  information  is  output  for every node in the network.
                  The  node-names  or  node-numbers  (ANF-10),  or   just
                  node-names (DECnet-10) are separated by commas.

        You can use the wildcard construction in the command string.  The
        node  name, or any part of the node name, can be replaced by * or
        ?  to represent groups of  nodes.   Wildcards  are  discussed  in
        Section 1.11.

        The switches to NETWORK allow you to specify:

         o  The format of the output.

         o  The configurations that you want to examine.

                                    NOTE

           You use switches to select a node with  or  without  a
           specific  attribute.  Use the proper switch, or prefix
           the switch with NO.  If you do not use the switch, the
           selection   of  a  node  does  not  depend  upon  that
           attribute.  If you do not specify a node, the  default
           output is /BRIEF.

           The command line takes the format specified below:

           NETWORK node-name,
           node-number,.../switch/switch...

           You can repeat node names, but not switches.

        Network Topology        Network Topology

        The topology of a network is determined by the interconnection of
        nodes  in  a  network.   Nodes  can  be  adjacent  to  each other
        connected by a physical link.  They can also  be  connected  with
        intermediate  nodes.   These  connections, with associated costs,
        determine the routes (paths) a message takes  from  one  node  to
        another.   The  costs are arbitrary values given to each physical
        connection of  the  network.   The  cost  of  a  given  route  is
        determined  by  the  sum of the costs of the physical connections
        along that route.  In cases where multiple routes  exist  between
        nodes,  the  route  with the lowest cost is taken.  In the ANF-10
        network, this information is available when you use the /TOPOLOGY
        switch.

        In  the  DECnet  network,  the  /TOPOLOGY  switch  displays   the
        information  available  for DECnet nodes.  The first two items of
        information are the node name  and  number,  followed  by  DECnet
        routing  information  for that node.  If the node is unreachable,
        then  this  information   is   placed   in   the   output   line:
        "Unreachable."  The  remaining information columns are left blank
        to indicate that information is not available.  If  the  node  is
        reachable, then the column shows the circuit name for the initial
        routing of a message to that node.

        The following columns show cost and number of hops, analogous  to
        the  ANF-10 network topology.  The cost for DECnet is set through
        network management functions on a per physical-connection  basis.
        If  you  ever  form  a  logical  link  between  your node and the
        destination node, information is available for the count of  open
        logical  links  and  the  round-trip delay time in milli-seconds.
        Otherwise, this information is not available, and the information
        fields  are  left blank.  Example 4 shows the output from the use
        of the /TOPOLOGY switch for both  ANF-10  and  DECnet-10  network
        environments.

        The NODE command prints ANF-10 and DECnet  network  configuration
        information.   If  you  do  not  specify  a  node-id,  the system
        displays information about the node to  which  your  terminal  is
        connected.   If you specify a node-id, the system displays system
        configuration information for the node(s) you specified.

        To use some commands (for example, SET HOST), you must know if  a
        node  has  a  command interpreter.  The NODE command displays the
        symbol MCR as a device on each ANF-10 node  that  has  a  command
        interpreter.

                  terminal is connected is printed.  That is, the  system
                  prints  the command interpreter of your job.  If you do

   Function   Function

        The PASSWORD command allows you to change your current  password.
        Your  password  may  be  a maximum of 39 characters.  Your system
        administrator may set a minimum password length.

        It asks you to confirm the change by  typing  your  new  password
        again.   If the two (new password and verification) do not match,
        the password is unaltered.  Neither old password,  new  password,
        nor the verification echoes on the terminal.  The command prompts
        you for all input.

        The PLEASE command allows you to communicate with  the  operator.
        You  can  send  a  message  to  the operator, leaving your job at
        monitor level, or you can enter a dialogue  that  allows  two-way
        communication with the operator.

        This format sends a message to the operator and leaves  your  job
        at monitor level.

        PLEASE<RET>

        This format enters into a dialog with the operator.  This  format
        is  also  useful  for  a message that is more than one line long.
        See Example 1.

        When you enter dialog mode, you can enter your text either of two
        ways:

         o  If  you  type  your  message  and  end   it   with   <CTRL/Z>
            (control-Z),  your  job  will  wait  for  a  reply  from  the
            operator.

         o  If you type your message and end it by pressing  ESCape,  the
            message will go to the operator and your job will be returned
            to monitor level.  You  may  press  <ESC>  without  typing  a
            message.  Your job will exit to monitor level immediately.

        The PLEASE command has two switches:

        PLOT dev:jobname=file-spec

                  dev        Where:    dev is the name of the specific device  on  which  your
                  files  should  be  plotted.   (For  example,  PLT2:  is
                  plotter number 2.) You can have your files plotted on a
                  device  connected  to  another node by using the format
                  PLTSxx:  where xx is the node  number.   (For  example,
                  PLTS31  is  a  plotter  on node 31.) The device name is
                  optional.

                  jobname                  jobname is the name of the job being entered  into  the
                  queue.   The  job name is optional.  The default is the
                  name of the first file in the request.

                  The equal sign is required if you  specify  either  the
                  device name, the job name, or both.

                  file-spec                  file-spec is a single file specification or a string of
                  file  specifications,  separated  by  commas.   A  file
                  specification is in the form dev:file.ext[directory].

        If you specify neither a job name nor a file  specification,  the
        system  prints  a  list  of the jobs in the plotter queue on your
        terminal.

        The switches to this command can be divided into two  categories,
        depending  on whether the switch can be used only once, or can be
        used more times, in a single command string.  The two  categories
        are:

            Queue-Operation Switches         o  Queue-Operation Switches

            These switches can be used only once in the  command  string.
            They  affect  the  entire  request,  and  you  can place them
            anywhere in the command string.  If  you  have  used  one  of
            these  switches  in a command string, you cannot use it again
            in the same string.  Many switches have a  /NO  construction,
            which  has a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the /NO
            construction of a switch in the same command string with  the
            positive construction.

        When a new entry is made in a system queue, the system  prints  a
        message on the user's terminal.  The message is in the form:

        [PLOTTER JOB name QUEUED, REQUEST #nnn, LIMIT xxx]

        PRINT dev:jobname=file-spec

                  dev        Where:    dev:  is the device name of the specific  line  printer
                  on  which  your files are to be printed.  (For example,
                  LPT2:  is line printer number 2.) You can specify  that
                  your  files  be printed on a printer on another node by
                  using the format LPTSxx, where xx is the  node  number.
                  (For  example,  LPTS31  is  a  printer on node 31.) The
                  device name is optional.

                  jobname                  jobname is the name of the job being entered  into  the
                  queue.   The  job name is optional.  The default is the
                  name of the first file in the request.

                  The equal sign is required if you specify  the  device,
                  job name, or both.

                  file-spec                  file-spec is a single file specification or a string of
                  file  specifications separated by commas, for the files
                  being processed.  A file specification is in  the  form
                  dev:file.ext[directory].

        If you specify neither the job name nor the input  specification,
        the system prints a list of all the jobs in the lineprinter queue
        on your terminal.

        You can use the asterisk  wildcard  construction  for  the  input
        specification.  Switches that aid in constructing the queue entry
        can appear as part of the input specifications.

        The switches to this command can be divided into two  categories,
        depending  on whether the switch can be used only once, or can be
        used more times, in a single command string.  The two  categories
        are:

           Queue-Operation Switches        o  Queue-Operation Switches

             These switches can be used only once in the command  string.
             They  affect  the  entire  request,  and  you can place them
             anywhere in the command string.  If you  have  used  one  of
             these  switches in a command string, you cannot use it again
             in the same string.  Many switches have a /NO  construction,
             which has a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the /NO
             construction of a switch in the same command string with the
             positive construction.

           File-Control Switches        o  File-Control Switches

             These switches can be  used  any  number  of  times  in  the
             command  string.  You can also use the /NO construction of a
             switch  in  the  same  command  string  with  the   positive
             construction.  To achieve a temporary or permanent effect by
             the placement of the switch, see Section 1.8.4.

                                      appropriately.      This     switch
                                      specifies that if any file does not
                                      exist,    no    files   should   be
                                      processed.  The value of YES or  NO
                                      is  optional.   If you specify YES,
                                      all of  the  specified  files  must
                                      exist.

        The  PROTECT  command  changes  the   access   protection   codes
        associated  with  the specified files or directories.  The change
        is made by renaming the file.

        You specify the access protection of  a  file  with  three  octal
        digits.   Each  digit represents a particular class of user.  The
        first  digit  represents  the  owner  of  the  file,  the  second
        represents  users  with the same project number as the owner, and
        the third represents all other users.  See Section  1.9.4  for  a
        description of protection codes.

        The standard protection is either <057> or <055>.   However,  the
        system  default  can be changed by individual installations.  The
        owner of a file can  alter  the  protection  code  of  that  file
        regardless of the existing protection code.

                  <nnn>                  <nnn> is an octal code.

                  You can specify the protection  code  before  the  file
                  name, in which case it applies for all following files.

                  If you have the required privileges, you can change the
                  protection of files not in your directory by specifying
                  the  desired  directory  name.   If  you  specify   the

        The QUEUE command makes entries in any of several system  queues,
        or  in  the  case  of the Event Queue, displays information only.
        The system queues are:

            Event Queue         o  Event Queue - Contains  information  about  scheduled  system
            events.  This information may include such things as the time
            the system will go down (KSYS) and when certain files will be
            closed.  This queue is a display queue only.

            Input  Queue         o  Input  Queue  -  Contains  the  batch  jobs  that  have  been
            submitted to the system.

            Mount Queue         o  Mount Queue - Contains  the  requests  for  resources  to  be
            mounted.  These are:  tape, disk, and DECtape mount requests.

            Output Queues:         o  Output Queues:

                Card Punch Queue             -  Card Punch Queue - Contains the requests that  have  been
                made for files to be punched on cards.

                Paper Tape Punch Queue             -  Paper Tape Punch Queue - Contains the requests that  have
                been made for files to be punched on paper tape.

                Plotter Queue             -  Plotter Queue - Contains the requests that have been made
                for files to be plotted.

                Printer Queue             -  Printer Queue - Contains the requests that have been made
                for files to be printed on a line printer.

        When queueing a request, you can specify  an  individual  device.
        If  you  do not specify a device, the first available appropriate
        device is used.

        All requests are placed in a  queue  (a  list  of  the  requests,
        arranged  according  to priority).  The requests are processed in
        this order.  Priority is established by the limit that is set  on
        each  request  (see  /LIMIT and /TIME below) and according to the
        specified priority number (see  /PRIORITY  below).   In  general,
        requests  with smaller limits and higher priorities are processed
        first.

        The QUEUE command also creates  lists  of  the  requests  in  the
        queues.  This list can be printed on the terminal or entered into
        a file.  The list includes the mount queue as well as  input  and
        output queues.

        The QUEUE command is  duplicated  by  the  CPUNCH,  PLOT,  PRINT,
        PUNCH,  SUBMIT,  and  TPUNCH  commands.   Each  of these commands
        performs a function with a specific system queue.

   Formats   Formats

        1.  To process a batch job, use the following format:

            QUEUE INP:jobname=control-file,log-file

                      jobname            Where:    jobname is the name of the job.  This name must  be
                      one  to  six alphanumeric characters.  The job name
                      is optional.  If you do not specify the  job  name,
                      the default is the name of the log file.

                      The equal sign is required.

                      control-file                      control-file is the file specification of the batch
                      control  file.   The file name is required.  If you
                      do not specify the file extension, the  default  is
                      .CTL.

                      log-file                      log-file is the file specification  that  you  want
                      assigned  to  the log file, which contains a record
                      of the processing of the batch job.  The  log  file
                      specification  is  optional.   If you omit the file
                      name, the default is the name of the control  file.
                      If  you  omit  the  file  extension, the default is
                      .LOG.

        2.  To make an entry  in  one  of  the  output  queues,  use  the
            following format:

            QUEUE dev:jobname=file-spec,file-spec

                      dev            Where:    dev:  is the name of the device on which the output
                      is  to  be  processed.   The  device  name may be a
                      generic  device  name,  in  which  case  the  first
                      available  device  is used, or it may be a specific
                      device name.  (For  example,  LPT:   is  the  first
                      available  line  printer.   LPT2:   is line printer
                      number 2.) To use a device on another node, use the
                      format devSxx:, where dev is a generic device name,
                      and xx is a node number.  (For example, LPTS34:  is
                      a line printer on node 34.) If you do not specify a
                      device name, the  default  is  LPT:.   The  generic
                      device names are:

                           LPT:  for line printer requests.
                           CDP:  for card punch requests.

                                PUSH Command


                           PLT:  for plotter requests.
                           PTP:  for paper tape punch requests

                      jobname                      jobname is the name of the job.  The  job  name  is
                      one  to  six alphanumeric characters.  The job name
                      is optional.  If you omit the job name, the name of
                      the  first  file  in the request is used as the job
                      name.  However, if the first file  does  not  exist
                      (see /NEW), the name of the second file is used.

                      file-spec                      file-spec is the file specification of the file  to
                      be  processed.   The  file  name  and extension are
                      required.

        3.  To obtain a file containing a list of all the entries in  all
            the queues, use the following format:

            QUEUE file-spec=/LIST

                      file-spec            Where:    file-spec is the file specification of  the  output
                      file.   If you omit the file extension, the default
                      is .LSQ.

        4.  To display the entries in any or all system  queues  on  your
            terminal, use the following format:

            QUEUE dev:

                      dev            Where:    dev is any of the system queue names.  These are:

                           INP:  for the batch input queue.
                           CDP:  for the card punch queue.
                           PLT:  for the plotter queue.
                           LPT:  for the line printer queue.
                           PTP:  for the paper tape punch queue.

                      The device name is optional.  If you do not specify
                      the  device name, all the entries in all the system
                      queues are printed on  your  terminal.   This  list
                      includes the mount queue.

   Switches   Switches

        The switches for the QUEUE, CPUNCH, PLOT, PRINT,  PUNCH,  SUBMIT,
        and TPUNCH commands can be placed anywhere in the command line.

        The switches can be divided into  two  categories,  depending  on
        whether  the  switch  can  be used only once, or can be used more
        times, in the command line.  The two categories are:

           Queue-Operation Switches        o  Queue-Operation Switches

             These switches can be used only once in the command  string.
             They  affect  the  entire  request,  and  you can place them
             anywhere in the command string.  If you  have  used  one  of
             these  switches in a command string, you cannot use it again
             in the same string.  Many switches have a /NO  construction,
             which  takes  a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the
             /NO construction of  one  of  these  switches  in  the  same
             command string with the positive construction of the switch.

           File-Control Switches        o  File-Control Switches

             These switches can be  used  any  number  of  times  in  the
             command  string.  You can use the /NO construction of one of
             these switches in the same command string with the  positive
             construction  of  the  switch.  For information about how to
             achieve a temporary or permanent effect by the placement  of
             the switch, see Section 1.8.4.

        In the following table of  switches,  the  switches  are  defined
        according  to  the queues that they affect.  The following labels
        signify the queue(s) that each switch affects.  The switches  are
        defined as follows:

             ALL     - Switches that affect both the  batch  input  queue
                       and the output queues.

             INPUT   - Switches that affect only the batch input queue.

             OUTPUT  - Switches  that  affect  only  the  output  queues.
                       OUTPUT  is  followed  by  (queue) in cases where a
                       switch is useful for that specific output queue.

             LIST    - Switches that affect the listing of  the  jobs  in
                       the   queue.   Listings  can  be  printed  on  the
                       terminal, or they can be  written  into  files  on
                       disk  or  tape.   LIST is followed by (queue) when
                       the listing function is useful for that queue.

        When a new entry is made in a system queue, the system  prints  a
        message on the user's terminal.  The message is in the form:

        [device JOB name QUEUED, REQUEST #nnn, LIMIT xxx]

                  device        Where:    device is the name of one of  the  output  devices,  or
                  BATCH.

                  name                  name is the name of the job in the queue.  This can  be
                  specified  by  the user.  Otherwise, it defaults to the
                  name of the first file in the request.  In the case  of
                  batch requests, the name of the log file is used as the
                  job name.

        The R command loads a core image from the  system  device  (SYS:)
        and starts it at the location specified within the file (.JBSA in
                                    _______ _______ _____  ______        the Job Data Area.  See the TOPS-10 Monitor Calls  Manual.)  This
        command  is  the same as RUN SYS:file.ext.  The R command is used
        to run a system program that does not have  an  operating  system
        command to run it.

        This command clears all user core.  However, programs should  not
        count  on  this action and should explicitly clear those areas of
        core that are expected to contain zeros (that is, programs should
        be   self-initializing).   This  action  allows  programs  to  be
        restarted by a CTRL/C, START sequence without another R command.

   Function   Function

        The REASSIGN command passes a device assignment from one  job  to
        another  job.   Both  restricted  and unrestricted devices can be
        reassigned.  When you specify a  DECtape  in  this  command,  the
        system clears the copy of the directory currently in memory.  The
        next time you refer to the directory, a new  copy  is  read  from
        tape  into  memory.   However,  the  logical  name  that has been
        assigned is not reassigned unless you reassign the device to your
        own job.

        REASSIGN dev:job

                  dev:        Where:    dev:  is the physical or logical name of the device  to
                  be reassigned.  This argument is required.  See Section
                  1.9.1 for a description of device names.

                  job                  job is the number of the job to which the device is  to
                  be  reassigned.   If no job is specified, the device is
                  reassigned to your job.  This is useful when  you  want
                  to  force  the next DECtape directory reference to come
                  from the tape instead of core.

        You can reassign a device using the logical name only if your job
        and the job to which the device is to be reassigned have the same
        project-programmer  number,  or  you  have  operator   privileges
        (logged in under [1,2] or logged in as OPR).

   Function   Function

        The REENTER command restarts a  program  at  an  alternate  entry
        point.   You  must  write  the  alternate  entry  point into your
        program.   The  REENTER   command   is   used   for   a   partial
        reinitialization of the program.

        The REENTER command copies the saved program counter  (PC)  value
        into  .JBOPC  and  starts the program at an alternate entry point
        specified in .JBREN (you must set it  or  have  it  set  in  your
        program).   All  Job  Data  Area  locations  are described in the
        _______ _______ _____ ______        TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual.

        If the job was executing a monitor call when it  was  interrupted
        (that  is,  at  monitor  level but not in TTY input wait or SLEEP
        mode), the monitor continues the job until the  monitor  call  is
        completed  and  then  traps to the REENTER address in .JBREN.  If
        the job is in TTY input wait or  SLEEP  mode,  the  trap  to  the
        REENTER  address  occurs  immediately  and  .JBOPC  contains  the
        address of the monitor call.

        If the job  is  at  user  level,  the  trap  occurs  immediately.
        Therefore,  it  is  always  possible  to continue the interrupted
        program after trapping by executing a JRSTF @.JBOPC.

                  sign (=).

        Device and file-structure names cannot be different for  old  and
        new  file-specs.   If  you  specify  the  device  name in the new
        file-spec, that device is the default for the old file-spec.  You
        can  use  RENAME  to  change  the  protection  code  of a file by
        specifying the protection codes in the file-specs.

        The directory name remains effective throughout the command line,
        but  you  can  specify  a  different directory name to change the
        directory of a file.  RENAME accepts wildcard constructions.

        If the new file name is specified without an extension, the  file
        will not have an extension.

   Function   Function

        The RUN command starts execution of a program.  It loads  a  core
        image from a retrievable storage device and starts the program at
        the location specified within the file (.JBSA).

        RUN looks for programs stored in files with the  extension  .EXE.
        Use SAVE or SSAVE to create the executable file.

        The RUN command clears all your core.  However,  programs  should
        not  count on this action and should explicitly clear those areas
        of core that are expected to contain zeros (that is, the programs
        should   be  self-initializing).   This  allows  programs  to  be
        restarted by a CTRL/C, START sequence  without  having  to  issue
        another RUN command.

        RUN dev:file.EXE[directory] core/switch

                  dev:        Where:    dev: is the logical or  physical  name  of  the  device
                  containing  the core image.  The default device name is

                  file.EXE                  file.EXE is the name of  the  file  that  contains  the
                  program you want to run.

                                           NOTE

                      Old-style SAVE files (.SAV, .HGH., .SHR) can be
                      run  with  the  RUN command.  However, the .EXE
                      format is recommended over the .SAV format.

                  [directory]                  [directory] is the directory name,  which  is  required
                  only  if  the core image file is located in a disk area
                  other than yours.   If  a  directory  specification  is
                  issued  in  the  command string and the device is SYS:,
                  the specified directory overrides  the  assumed  device
                  (SYS:).

                  core                  core is the amount of core memory  if  this  amount  is
                  different  from  either the minimum core needed to load
                  the program, or the core argument of the  SAVE  command
                  that saved the file.

   Function   Function

        The SAVE and SSAVE commands create executable  image  files  from
        programs   that   are   loaded  in  core  memory.   SAVE  creates
        non-sharable  files  with  the  extension  .EXE.   SSAVE  creates
        sharable files with the extension .EXE.

        After you use SAVE or SSAVE to create an .EXE file, you  can  run
        the program with the RUN command.

                  be  written.   The  default  device  name is DSK:.  The
                  colon following the device name is required if a device
                  is specified.

                  file                  file is the name to be assigned to the core image file.
                  The default file name is your job's current name as set
                  by your last R, RUN, or GET command; the  last  command
                  that  ran  a program (for example, DIRECT); or the last
                  SETNAM monitor call.

                  .EXE                  .EXE is the default file extension.  This  argument  is

                  core                  core is the amount of core in which the program  is  to
                  be  run.   This  value is stored in JOBDAT as the job's
                  core area, (.JBCOR) and is used by subsequent  RUN  and
                  GET commands.  This argument is optional.

                  You can specify core arguments in units of  1024  words
                  or 512 words (a page) by following the number with K or
                  P respectively.  For example, 2P represents 2 pages  or
                  1024  words.   If  you  do  not specify K or P, K (1024
                  words) is assumed.

                  If core is omitted, only the number of blocks  required
                  by the core image area (as explained in the RUN command
                  description) is assumed.

   Function   Function

        The SEND command provides one-way interterminal communication.  A
        single  line  of  information  is transmitted from the initiating
        terminal to the terminal specified in the  SEND  command  string.
        The  recipient  of  the SEND receives the terminal line number of
        the sender as well as the message.

        A busy test is made on a single-destination  message  before  the
        message  is sent, unless the sender or receiver of the message is
        OPR or a job logged in as [1,2].  The receiver of the message  is
        considered  busy if the terminal is not at monitor command level.
        If the receiving  terminal  is  busy,  the  sender  receives  the
        message  BUSY  and  the  information  is  not sent.  However, the
        receiving terminal always receives the message if it has the  TTY
        NO GAG bit set (see the SET TTY NO GAG command).

        If the receiving  terminal  is  hardwired  and  turned  off,  the
        information appears to have been sent because the software cannot
        detect an OFF condition on  hardwired  terminals.   Terminals  in
        IMAGE and Packed Image Mode (PIM) mode do not receive messages.

   Function   Function

        The SESSION command allows you to change the account  and  remark
        strings  of your job.  If your system is not running with account
        validation, the SESSION command has no effect.  If your system is
        running  with account validation, you can use the SESSION command
        to change the billing profile of your job.

        For example, you may have several  projects,  each  of  which  is
        charged  to  a  separate  account.   Therefore,  several  account
        strings are valid for your PPN.  The SESSION command  allows  you
        to change the account string for your job without logging out and
        logging in again.  Thus, all subsequent charges will be  made  to
        the new account.

        If account validation is enabled, the string you type must  match
        one  of the accounts assigned to your PPN.  The string must match
        in case (lower  or  uppercase),  although  this  feature  can  be
        changed by the system administrator.

   Function   Function

        The SET BREAK command is used during the debugging process  on  a
        KL10 processor only.  It is useful when the program that is being
        debugged:

         o  Will not fail when DDT has been loaded.

         o  Destroys DDT when DDT is loaded.

         o  Destroys  the  contents  of   a   memory   location   at   an
            unpredictable point during program execution.

        It is possible to break when the specified location is read from,
        written  into,  and/or  fetched.  It is also possible to break on
        monitor references to items  in  your  address  space.   This  is
        useful  when  the  monitor  stores or retrieves arguments to/from
        unexpected locations in your address space because  of  erroneous
        monitor call argument lists.

        If you are breaking on a WRITE  condition,  the  WRITE  condition
        causing  the  break  will not have been executed.  Therefore, the
        instruction located at PC and all  operands  should  be  examined
        before continuing program execution.

                  addr                  addr  is  an  octal  number  in  the  range   0-777777,
                  representing  a  user  virtual address.  The address is
                  not necessary.

                  condition                  condition is one or more reasons for allowing the break
                  to   occur.   The  condition  is  not  necessary.   The
                  condition arguments are listed below.

                  x                  x is the number of times the sequence should run before
                  the  break  occurs.  The variable is any decimal number
                  from 1 to 511.

                  n                  n is a section number ranging  from  0-37  octal.   The
                  commas separating n and addr are optional.

        Multiple conditions can be specified within  one  command;  these
        conditions  are  separated  from  one  another  by  commas.   The
        possible conditions that can be specified are:

        READ      Breaks if the contents of addr are read by the program.
                  This   condition   causes   a   break  to  occur  on  a
                  read-modify-write as well as on a read.

        WRITE     Breaks if the location specified  by  addr  is  written
                  into.

        EXECUTE   Breaks if an instruction is fetched from  the  location
                  specified in the command string.

        ALL       Breaks if the location specified in the command  string
                  is  read  from (READ), written into (WRITE), or fetched
                  from (EXECUTE).

        MUUO      Breaks on monitor  references  as  qualified  by  READ,
                  WRITE, and/or EXECUTE.

        If all three break  conditions  are  to  be  specified,  you  can
        include  the  word ALL in the command line, replacing the command
        argument string:  WRITE,READ,EXECUTE.  When you  want  breaks  on
        monitor  references  for  all  three  break  conditions,  you can
        include one of the following  command  argument  strings  in  the
        command line:  either MUUO,ALL or MUUO,READ,WRITE,EXECUTE.

        If you use SET BREAK with no conditions, the previously specified
        conditions are used.  If there was no previous SET BREAK command,
        ALL is  assumed.   When  issuing  a  SET  BREAK  command  without
        specifying  any  address,  the conditions included in the command
        line are ORed with existing break conditions and  the  previously
        specified  address  is  used.   If  there  are  no existing break
        conditions, 0 is the default address.

        In summary, break addresses remain in effect until  changed;  and
        break conditions remain in effect until removed.

        If you want to remove a break  condition,  the  condition  to  be
        removed can be specified in the following command:

        SET BREAK NO condition

                             SET BREAK Command


        If all existing break conditions are to be removed, the following
        command line can be issued:

        SET BREAK NONE

        This command will remove all existent break conditions, but  will
        not remove a previously specified address.  An example of setting
        a default break location is:

        SET BREAK 1000 ON READ,WRITE,EXECUTE
        SET BREAK NO READ
        SET BREAK NONE
        SET BREAK EXECUTE ;1000 IS DEFAULT BREAK LOCATION

        When a break occurs, one of the messages:

        %ADDRESS BREAK AT USER PC xxxxxx

        %ADDRESS BREAK AT EXEC xxxxxx UUO AT USER xxxxxx

        will be printed, and your terminal will be left at monitor level.
        The  second message is produced when MUUO was included in the SET
        BREAK command line.  If you type:

        .CONTINUE

        the program will  continue  execution  at  the  instruction  that
        caused the break.

   Function   Function

        The SET  CPU  command  allows  privileged  users  to  change  the
        processors  where  jobs can run.  It is used in a multiprocessing
        system to specify whether the programs that run under the job can
        be  processed  on  the  primary CPU, the secondary CPU, or either
        CPU.  The job remains with the specified CPU until:

         o  another SET CPU command with  a  different  specification  is
            given,

         o  a KJOB command is issued,

         o  a privileged user's program overrides the SET CPU command  by
            issuing the SETUUO with a different specification.

        If the SETUUO overrides the command, the specification  given  in
        the  monitor call remains in effect until a RESET or EXIT monitor
        call  or  another  SETUUO  with  a  different  specification   is
        executed.   When  an  EXIT or RESET monitor call is executed, the
        job reverts to the  specification  given  in  the  last  SET  CPU
        command.   When  you log in, the CPU specification is usually set
        to ALL.  The schedulers for each CPU compete for  jobs  with  the
        ALL  specification  so  that  the  load  is  dynamically balanced
        between CPUs.  Therefore, this command is  generally  not  needed
        but is provided in case you want to change the CPU specification.

   Function   Function

        The SET DEFAULT BIGBUF command sets the disk buffer size for  the
        job.   Disk  I/O  can  be  improved by increasing the disk buffer
        size, but buffers increase the size of the job.

        With the SET DEFAULT BIGBUF command, each added block  gives  you
        200  octal words of disk buffer.  For example, SET DEFAULT BIGBUF
        5 sets the buffer size to  5  blocks  (1200  octal  words).   SET
        DEFAULT  BIGBUF  0  defaults  the  buffer size to one block.  The
        maximum value for SET DEFAULT BIGBUF is 31.  When big buffers are
        in  use,  TOPS-10  defaults to a value of four blocks (1000 octal
        words).

        Because the SET DEFAULT BIGBUF command sets the buffer  size  for
        the job, the buffer size will remain the same until the user logs
        out, or changes it by using the command again.

                                      NOTE

                In order to use big buffers, the program that  is
                doing  disk  I/O  must  be written to utilize the
                buffer size.   Otherwise,  this  command  has  no
                effect on your job except to increase job size.

   Function   Function

        The SET DEFAULT BUFFERS command changes the number of buffers  in
        your  memory  area.  The default number of buffers for disk is 6;
        for all other devices, the default number is 2.  Use this command
        to  increase  or  decrease the number of memory buffers that your
        program will use.

        A larger number of buffers will usually allow your program to run
        faster.  A smaller number of buffers will allow you to run larger
        programs.

                                      NOTE

                If you increase the number  of  buffers,  it  may
                interfere  with the operation of overlay programs
                and other large programs.

        The SET DEFAULT PROTECTION command sets a default protection code
        for files you create during the job.  Any value you set with this

   Function   Function

        The SET DEFER command causes all output requests (except disk and
        tape  output)  generated  by  programs  run  by  your  job  to be
        deferred.  These requests will be processed  when  you  log  out.
        Any  files  that  are  generated  implicitly  by a system program
        (DIRECT, CREF) and automatically output to the line printer, card
        punch,  plotter,  or paper tape punch will be held by QUEUE until
        you log out.  When you log out,  the  files  are  output  to  the
        appropriate devices, or spooled for output, if spooling is set.

        Deferred queuing can also be set by logging in  with  the  /DEFER
        switch.  This function is the default for batch jobs.

        To prevent all future  requests  from  being  deferred,  use  SET
        NODEFER.

        To queue any deferred requests that are being held for your  job,
        use the appropriate queue command (CPUNCH, PLOT, PRINT, QUEUE, or
        TPUNCH) followed by two switches:   /DEFERRED  and  /CREATE.   To
        delete  the  deferred  requests without output, use /DEFERRED and
        /KILL.  /DEFERRED releases any requests that are being  held  for
        your  job,  and processes them according to the other switch that
        you specify.

             issuing an error message and returning your job  to  monitor
             level without any opportunity for you to continue.


        SET DSKFUL PAUSE

             Stops output and suspends  execution  of  the  program.   An
             error message is printed on your terminal and control of the
             job is returned to the monitor.  Generally, you  should  use
             the  SEND  command  at this point to request assistance from
             the operator.

             Execution of the program can be resumed  with  the  CONTINUE

        The SET  DSKPRI  command  allows  privileged  users  to  set  the
        priority for their job's disk operations (data transfers and head
        positionings).  The standard priority is  0,  and  the  range  of
        permissible values is -3 to +3.  This means that a priority lower
        than the standard can be specified as well as one higher than the
        standard.   The  priority  specified  applies  to  all  disk  I/O
        channels currently open or subsequently opened whose priority has
        not  been  explicitly  set  with a DISK.  monitor call.  (See the
        _______ _______ _____ ______        TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual.) The priority specified in the  SET

        occurs:

         o  Another  SET  DSKPRI  command  is  given  with  a   different

   Function   Function

        The SET HOST command connects you to another host computer on the
        same DECnet or ANF-10 network.

        Using the SET HOST command, you can remain at  one  terminal  and
        switch  the  terminal  connection  from one system to a different
        system.

        For ANF-10 networks, the node you specify must be a network  node
        where  you  can run LOGIN or an equivalent program.  The SET HOST
        command cannot be used to connect to a node that does not have  a
        command  interpreter.   Use  the  NETWORK  command  with the /MCR
        switch to determine the nodes in the network  that  have  command
        interpreters.   MCR is a name that is used by the NETWORK program
        to signify a command interpreter.

        Once a terminal has been connected to a particular ANF-10  system
        through  SET  HOST,  it  remains  connected  to that system until
        another SET HOST command  is  issued  from  that  terminal.   For
        example:   you  log  in  to a system, issue a SET HOST command to
        KS4101 (another host system), do your work, and then log off  the
        system.   Then, when another user uses your terminal, he too will
        be running on the KS4101 host system until he issues another  SET
        HOST command or until the system is reloaded.

        On DECnet, when you SET HOST to another system and then log  off,
        you  do not remain connected, as you would with ANF-10, but would
        drop back to your original system.

             o  Does not destroy your core image.

        2.  If you SET HOST to DECnet nodes, the SET HOST command:

   Function   Function

        The SET HPQ command allows privileged users to place  their  jobs
        in   a   high-priority   run  queue.   When  your  job  is  in  a
        high-priority run queue, you can obtain a faster response than in
        the  normal timesharing queues.  The job remains in the specified
        high-priority queue until one of the following occurs:

         o  You issue another SET  HPQ  command  specifying  a  different
            high-priority queue.

         o  You log out.

         o  Your program overrides the SET HPQ command by issuing an  HPQ
            monitor call with a different value.

        If an HPQ monitor call overrides the command, the level specified
        in  the  monitor  call  remains  in  effect until a RESET or EXIT
        monitor call or another HPQ monitor call with a  different  value
        is executed.  When an EXIT or RESET monitor call is executed, the
        job is returned to the high-priority queue specified in the  last
        SET HPQ command.

                  queue is the normal timesharing queue.   Queue  numbers
                  from  1  to 15 are high-priority queues.  The number of

                  argument, the job will never go virtual.

                                           NOTE

                      The monitor regards a limit as  a  set  maximum
                      number.  When the monitor reaches the specified
                      limit, it begins  virtual  handling.   However,
                      the  GUIDELINE  argument  allows the monitor to
                      use discretion in determining the page size.

   Function   Function

        The SET RETRY command controls the  function  of  the  DX10  tape
        drive  controller.   When  retry  is set, the controller recovers
        from soft errors, and it reports both soft  and  hard  errors  in
        SYS:ERROR.SYS.   When  retry  is  off,  the  controller  does not
        recover from soft errors and all  errors  are  reported  as  hard
        errors in ERROR.SYS.

        The SET SPOOL command adds devices to or deletes devices from the
        current  list of devices being spooled for your job.  Spooling is
        the mechanism by which I/O  to  or  from  slow-speed  devices  is
        simulated on disk.  Devices capable of being spooled are the line
        printer, the card punch, the card reader, the paper  tape  punch,
        and the plotter.

   Function   Function

        The SET TTY command (or TTY command) declares properties  of  the
        terminal on which the command is typed.  The word TERMINAL can be
        used instead of the word TTY in the SET TTY command.

   Defaults   Defaults

        The system has a terminal default for any terminal that  has  not
        been  declared  to  be  of  a  particular  type.  This default is
        generic TTY.  Before you  specify  the  characteristics  of  your
        terminal, the TTY defaults are in effect.  The exceptions to this
        are terminal input and output speeds.

        To discover the characteristics that the system has  assigned  to
        your  terminal,  use the INITIA TTY command.  This is illustrated
        in the example.

        If you use the SET TTY TYPE command, the system assumes  defaults
        according to the terminal type you declared.  These defaults, and
        the defaults for TTY, are listed in Table 2-1.

                            with the  WIDTH  argument,  CRLF  gives  an

                            This  is  used  when  you  type  characters
                            before  the output is finished.  DEFER hold
                            the characters until the  program  requests
                            input; NO DEFER allows them to be echoed on
                            your terminal as soon as normal  output  is
                            complete.

        DISPLAY             Notifies the system that the  terminal  you
                            are  using is a display terminal.  Programs
                            use this information to control  output  to
                            the terminal.

        ECHO                Controls echoing on the terminal.  NO  ECHO
                            suppresses  echoing  of  all characters you

        EIGHTBIT            Enables the terminal to accept and generate

        FILL n              Assigns filler class  n  to  the  terminal.
                            Some  terminals  require one or more filler
                            characters to  be  sent  following  certain
                            control  characters  such as line feed (LF)
                            and horizontal tab (HT).   With  the  DN87S
                            front-end, there will be a short time lapse
                            before each character is sent.

                            Table 2-2 illustrates the number of fillers
                            sent  for  each character and filler class.
                            The    filler     characters     are     CR
                            (carriage-return),   and   DEL  (DELETE  or
                            RUBOUT) for all other characters.

                            No fillers  are  supplied  for  image  mode

        LC                  Controls the translation of lowercase letters
                            to   uppercase  letters.   NO LC  allows  all
                            characters to be translated to  uppercase  by
                            the monitor.

                            Frequently,  it  is  convenient  to  have   a
                            terminal  with  both  uppercase and lowercase
                            simulate the behavior of one  with  uppercase
                            only.   TTY  NO  LC  causes  the  monitor  to
                            perform this simulation.  The echo sent  back
                            by the monitor always matches the case of the
                            characters after translation.  By looking  at
                            the   output,   you   can  determine  whether
                            translation was  performed  by  the  monitor.
                            The  default  condition  is determined by the
                            declared terminal type.

        LENGTH n            Defines the number of lines of your  terminal
                            page.   To stop output on your terminal after
                            a page of length n, use the arguments STOP or
                            PAGE.

                            SBELL, SSTOP,  STOP,  XONXOF  will  use  this
                            value as the page length.

        LOCALCOPY           Controls echoing to the terminal.  Local-copy
                            terminals (terminals that automatically print
                            each character as you type it) do not require
                            that   the  system  echo  characters  to  the
                            terminal.   NO LOCALCOPY   is   the   default
                            setting.   Use  LOCALCOPY  for  a  local-copy
                            terminal.

        OVERSTRIKE          Indicates    the    terminal     allows     a
                            three-character   sequence   to   create  one

                            character,  backspacing,  and  then  printing
                            another character over the first.  To display

                            page,   enables  recognition  of  CTRL/Q  and
                            CTRL/S (XON/XOFF; see Section 1.6.) and stops
                            output  to your terminal after n lines.  That
                            is, TTY PAGE n is the same as  TTY  LENGTH  n
                            XONXOF  STOP.   The  default  value  of  n is
                            determined by  the  declared  terminal  type.
                            TTY  PAGE and TTY PAGE 0 have the same effect
                            as TTY XONXOF.

                            This argument is useful for display terminals
                            because it prevents output from scrolling off
                            the screen.  When output is  stopped  by  the
                            system  after  n  lines,  the  terminal  bell
                            rings.  Use CTRL/Q to continue output to your
                            terminal.

        QUOTE               Causes a  ^V  (control-V)  and  character  to
                            behave  as  a  single  super-quote character.
                            They will not echo separately, and  a  single
                            delete  erases  them  both.   NO QUOTE is the
                            default argument.

        REMOTE              Clears the "local" access characteristic  for
                            your  job.  REMOTE is not recommended for use
                            by non-privileged users  because  the  action
                            can  be  reversed  only by an operator [1,2].

                            REMOTE.  NO REMOTE sets your terminal so that

        SLAVE               Specifies that the terminal  becomes  slaved,
                            so  that  no  commands  can  be  typed on the
                            terminal.  This is useful for terminals  that
                            are ASSIGNed by another job.  This command is
                            not recommended  for  use  by  non-privileged
                            users  because  the  actions  can be reversed
                            only by an operator [1,2], using NO SLAVE.

        SPEED m n           Sets the terminal transmitting speed to m and
                            the  receiving  speed  to n.  To set the same
                            transmitting and receiving speed, use  the  m
                            argument alone.  You must adjust the speed of
                            your terminal to match m and n using switches
                            on your terminal.

                            NO SPEED is an invalid argument.

                                                NOTE

                                Certain  hardware  configurations  do
                                not allow transmit and receive speeds
                                to be different (also  called  "split
                                speed").

        SSTOP n             Ignores CTRL/Q until output is stopped either
                            automatically  by  the  system,  or by CTRL/S
                            from user.  The page length n is optional.

        STOP n              Stops output to  the  terminal  automatically
                            after   n   lines.   The  page  length  n  is
                            optional.  When you  type  CTRL/Q,  the  page
                            length counter is reset to 0.

        TAB                 Specifies that this terminal has hardware TAB
                            stops  every  eight  columns.  The default is
                            set according to the declared terminal  type.
                            When  you  use  NO TAB, the monitor simulates
                            tabs by sending the necessary number of SPACE
                            characters.

        TAPE                Causes CTRL/S and CTRL/Q to  stop  and  start

                            TTY is a generic terminal and is the  default
                            for  terminals  whose  types  have  not  been
                            declared.  The characteristics set for  these
                            types are described in Table 2-2.

                            The characteristics that are set by declaring
                            the terminal type are:

                            TYPE  is  not  a  necessary  portion  of  the
                            command  string.   For  example,  you can set
                            your terminal type to that  of  an  LA120  by
                            typing SET TTY LA120.

        UC                  Equivalent to SET TTY NO LC.  Translates  all
                            lowercase  letters  to  uppercase.   NO UC is
                            equivalent to SET TTY LC.

        WIDTH n             Sets the terminal width (the  length  of  the
                            line) to n characters.  This command combined
                            with the SET TTY CRLF command enables you  to
                            specify  the  widest possible margin for your
                            terminal.  The default setting is  determined
                            by the declared terminal type.

        XONXOF              Allows you to use CTRL/S  (XOFF)  and  CTRL/Q
                            (XON) to stop and resume system output to the
                            terminal.  This is the  default.   NO  XONXOF
                            prevents  the  system from recognizing CTRL/S
                            and CTRL/Q.

   Function   Function

        The START command begins execution of a program that  you  loaded
        previously  with  either  the  LOAD  or  GET command, or that you
        interrupted while running (for example, with a CTRL/C).

        You  can  optionally  specify  an  explicit  start  address.   If
        omitted,  the  address  supplied in the file (.JBSA) is used.  If
        you specify an address argument  and  the  job  was  executing  a
        monitor  call  when interrupted (that is, it was at monitor level
        but not in TTY input wait or SLEEP mode), the  monitor  continues
        the  job  at  the  location  at  which  it  was  interrupted  and
        eventually traps to the specified START address.

        If you try to  START  an  execute-only  program  at  a  specified
        address,  you  receive  an error message.  If the high segment of
        this program is sharable, execution of the START command turns on
        the user-mode write protect bit.

                  other  than  the  location  specified  within  the file
                  (.JBSA).  This argument is optional.   If  you  do  not
                  specify  this  argument,  the address comes from .JBSA.

                  queue.   The  jobname is optional.  If you omit it, the
                  default job name is the name of the log file.

                  The equal sign is required only if you specify the  job
                  name.

                  control-file-spec                  control-file-spec is the name of the input file.   This
                  file contains all monitor-level and user-level commands
                  for processing by the batch  controller  (BATCON).   If
                  you  do not include a device in the file specification,
                  and if the monitor does not find the  control  file  in
                  your  job  search  list, the monitor will search ersatz
                  device CTL for the control file.

                  log-file-spec                  log-file-spec is the name  of  the  output  file.   The
                  batch   controller   uses   this  file  to  record  its
                  processing of the job.

        Only the two files mentioned above can be specified in a  request
        to  the  batch  input  queue.   The  name  of the control file is
        required; the log file name is optional and, if omitted, is taken
        from  the  control file.  If the job name is omitted, it defaults
        to the name of the log file, if  present,  or  the  name  of  the
        control  file  if  no  log file is specified.  If an extension is
        omitted, the following are assumed:

        .CTL for the control file
        .LOG for the log file

        If you type SUBMIT with no arguments or switches, a list  of  the
        jobs in the batch queue will be printed on your terminal.

        The switches to this command can be divided into two  categories,
        depending  on whether the switch can be used only once, or can be
        used more times, in a single command string.  The two  categories
        are:

            Queue-Operation Switches         o  Queue-Operation Switches

            These switches can be used only once in the  command  string.
            They  affect  the  entire  request,  and  you  can place them
            anywhere in the command string.  If  you  have  used  one  of
            these  switches  in a command string, you cannot use it again
            in the same string.  Many switches have a  /NO  construction,
            which  has a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the /NO
            construction of a switch in the same command string with  the
            positive construction.

            File-Control Switches         o  File-Control Switches

            These switches can be used any number of times in the command
            string.  You can also use the /NO construction of a switch in
            the same command string with the positive  construction.   To
            achieve  a  temporary or permanent effect by the placement of
            the switch, see Section 1.8.4.

        The SYSTAT command prints status information about the system.

        To write the information on the disk as  a  file  with  the  name
        SYSTAT.TXT, assign device DSK: with logical name SYSTAT.

        SYSTAT prints the status of the system:   system  name,  time  of
        day,  date,  system  uptime, CPU uptime on an SMP system, percent
        null time (idle plus lost time), number of jobs in use.

        SYSTAT prints the status  of  each  job  logged-in:   job-number;
        project-programmer number ([OPR] is the operator's job, [SELF] is
        your job), terminal line number (CTY is console terminal, DET  is
        detached,  Pn  is  PTY  number);  program name being run; program
                                                  _______  _______  _____        size; job and  swapped  state  (see  the  TOPS-10  Monitor  Calls
        ______        Manual), and runtime since the job logged in.

        SYSTAT prints the status of high segments being used:  name (PRIV
        is nonsharable, OBS is superseded); device or file structure name
        from which the segment came; the directory name; the size (SW  is
        swapped  out, SWF is swapped out and fragmented, F is in core and
        fragmented on disk, SPY signifies using the  SPY  monitor  call);
        the number of users in core or on the disk.

        SYSTAT prints the amount of  swapping  space  used,  the  virtual
        memory  used,  swapping  ratio,  active  swapping  ratio, virtual
        memory saved by sharing, and average job size.

        SYSTAT prints status of busy devices:  device  name,  job-number,
        how  device  is  assigned  (AS is ASSIGN command, INIT is INIT or
        OPEN monitor call, AS+INIT is both ways).

        SYSTAT prints system file structures:  free blocks, mount  count,
        single-access structures, and private structures.

        SYSTAT  prints  non-network  dataset  control:   number  of   the
        terminal, status of the terminal.

             A number n that causes information to be listed only for the
             specified job (that is, job n).  A period causes information
             for your job to be printed.

             A project-programmer number  specified  in  square  brackets
             causes  information  to  be  printed  only for jobs with the
             specified project-programmer  number.   The  project  and/or
             programmer number can be specified with an asterisk.

             A number preceded by a number sign (#n)  causes  information
             to  be  printed  only  for  jobs from the indicated terminal
             (that is, TTYn).  In addition, a  C  following  the  command
             indicates CTY, Pnn indicates PTYnn, Tnn indicates TTYnn, and
             a period indicates the terminal on which the SYSTAT  command
             is issued.

        If you wanted to use the ASSIGN command to assign LPT 260 to your

        The TECO command opens a file for editing using  TECO.   See  the
        TECO manual in the TOPS-10 Software Notebooks.

        This command  runs  the  COMPIL  program,  which  interprets  the

                  the existing file.  If omitted, DSK:  is assumed.

                  file.ext                  file.ext is the file name and the file  name  extension
                  of the existing file.  If omitted, the arguments of the
                  last MAKE or TECO command are used.

                  [directory]                  [directory] is the directory name  where  the  file  is
                  stored.  If omitted, your default directory is assumed.

        You can pass switches to TECO by  preceding  the  switch  with  a
        slash  in  the  TECO  command string.  When COMPIL interprets the
        command string, it passes the switches to TECO.

   Function   Function

        The TIME command prints the total run time since  the  last  time
        you  issued the TIME command, followed by the total run time used
        by the job since it was initialized (logged-in), followed by  the
        integrated    product   of   running   time   and   memory   size
        (KILO-CORE-SEC=).  Time is printed in the following format:

        hh:mm:ss.hh

                  hh        Where:    hh is hours
                  mm                  mm is minutes
                  ss.hh                  ss.hh is seconds to nearest hundredth.

        Interrupt level and job scheduling times are charged to whichever
        user   was   running   the  system  job  when  the  interrupt  or
        rescheduling occurred.

                                      NOTE

                If automatic run time is  enabled  with  the  SET

                  attached is assumed.  In this case, the monitor  prints
                  the  incremental run time (run time since the last TIME

        The TPUNCH command places  entries  into  the  paper  tape  punch
        output  queue.   See  the  QUEUE  command description for further
        information and examples.

        TPUNCH dev:jobname=file-spec

                  dev        Where:    dev:  is the name of the specific tape punch  on  which
                  your  files  should  be processed.  (For example, PTP2:
                  is tape punch  number  2.)  You  can  have  your  files
                  processed  on another node by using the format PTPSxx:,
                  where xx is the node number.  (For example, PTPS25:  is
                  a punch on node 25.) The device name is optional.

                  jobname                  jobname is the name of the job to be entered  into  the
                  queue.   The  default  is the name of the first file in
                  the request.

                  The equal sign is required if you specify the job name,
                  the device name, or both.

                  file-spec                  file-spec is a single file specification or a string of
                  file specifications, separated by commas, for the files
                  to be processed.  A file specification is in  the  form
                  dev:file.ext[directory].

        If you do not enter a job name or  an  input  specification,  the
        system prints a list of the jobs in the paper tape punch queue on
        your terminal.

        The switches to this command can be divided into two  categories,
        depending  on whether the switch can be used only once, or can be
        used more times, in a single command string.  The two  categories
        are:

           Queue-Operation Switches        o  Queue-Operation Switches

             These switches can be used only once in the command  string.
             They  affect  the  entire  request,  and  you can place them
             anywhere in the command string.  If you  have  used  one  of
             these  switches in a command string, you cannot use it again
             in the same string.  Many commands have a /NO  construction,
             which  takes  a negative effect.  Be sure you do not use the
             /NO construction of a switch in the same command string.

             switch in the same command string.  To achieve  a  temporary
             or  permanent  effect  by  the  placement of the switch, see

                                      appropriately.      This     switch
                                      specifies that if any file  is  not
                                      present,   no   files   should   be

        The full wildcard construction can be used for the file name  and

        Switches can be passed to PIP by enclosing them in parentheses in

        The VERSION command prints on your terminal the version number of
        the  program in your core area (that is, the last program you ran
        implicitly or  explicitly).   One  use  of  this  command  is  to
        determine  the  program  that  printed  an  error message on your
        terminal.  If your terminal is still at user level  (that  is,  a
        character other than a period was printed) after the message, you
        can type the following:

        ^C        (two CTRL/Cs if the program is not waiting for input)
        .VERSION

        The monitor returns with the name of the program  in  core  (that
        is, the one presumed to have printed the message) and the version
        number of that program.  After receiving the information, you can
        type  CONTINUE  to  return  your  terminal  to user mode.  If the
        message was a fatal message (that is, a period was printed  after
        the message), you do not have to type CTRL/C because the terminal
        is already at monitor level.  In  most  cases,  you  cannot  type
        CONTINUE after a fatal error message.

        The version number is obtained from .JBVER and .JBHVR in the  job
        data  area  and is printed in standard format.  Similar output is
        automatically generated by the SET WATCH VERSION  command.   (See
        the  SET  WATCH  command  description.) The output from these two
        commands is in one of the following forms:

             [low + high]        The low and high segments are different.

             [low]               There is only a low segment.

             [low +]             The low and high segments are the same.

             [+]                 A GETSEG monitor call has been performed
                                 to  a  high segment that matches the low
                                 segment.

             [+ high]            A GETSEG monitor call has been done to a
                                 high segment that does not match the low
                                 segment.

             [+ high + high]     A SEGOP. monitor call has been  done  to
                                 bring  a  high segment into core without
                                 destroying the existing high segment.

             [blank]             The high segment has been released.

        With  the  VERSION  command,  the  low  and  high  segments   are
        represented in the format:

        name version

        With the SET WATCH VERSION command, the low and high segments are
        represented in one of three formats:

             name version      The program is not from SYS:.

             :name version     The output  is  the  result  of  a  SETNAM
                               monitor  call  (for example, at the end of
                               loading).

             S:name version    The program is a program loaded  from  the
                               system  device  (actual  SYS:, not logical
                               device SYS:).

        The name is the name  of  the  program  and  the  version  is  in
        standard format.  When the version number is output, the standard
        format is:

        major-version minor-version(edit)-group who modified program

        The major version is octal; the minor version is alphabetic;  the
        edit  is octal and enclosed in parentheses and the group who last
        modified the program is octal and preceded by a hyphen (0 is  DEC
        development,  1 is all other DEC personnel, and 2-7 is customer).
        There are no spaces separating the items, and if an item is zero,
        it  does not appear in print.  The parentheses and hyphen also do
        not appear in print if  the  corresponding  item  is  zero.   The
        following  are  examples  of  version  numbers output in standard
        format.

                              SWITCH.INI FILES                              SWITCH.INI FILES



   You can create a SWITCH.INI file in your UFD into which  you  can  put
   switches  for  certain  programs.   Some  of  the  programs  that read
   SWITCH.INI are:

        BACKUP         CREDIR
        DIRECTORY      FORTRAN
        INITIA         LINK
        LOGIN          MAKLIB
        QUEUE          RUNOFF
        SORT

   The SWITCH.INI file allows you to automatically  override  the  system
   defaults  of  these programs.  The SWITCH.INI file must reside in your
   UFD.  A SWITCH.INI file can contain two types of command lines.

   The first type of line is written in the following format:

        program-name/switch/switch/.../switch

             program-name   Where:    program-name is a program name such as DIRECTORY or LOGIN or
             a  command  name  which  runs  one  of the programs, such as
             PRINT.  You must use the full program name or at  least  six
             characters of any program name that is longer.

              switch             /switch is a valid switch for the named program.

                              SWITCH.INI FILES                              SWITCH.INI FILES


   Example   Example

        DIRECTORY/DETAIL/NOSUMMARY

   When you run the program, the switches in SWITCH.INI will be  used  as
   the  defaults instead of any program-defined defaults.  When you run a
   program,  the  system  searches  your  directory  for  a  file  called
   SWITCH.INI.   If  the  file  is not found the program uses any program
   defaults.  If the system finds the file but does not find a  line  for
   the program, it uses any program defaults.  When the system finds your
   SWITCH.INI file and the line for the program,  the  program  uses  the
   switch  values that you have specified in your SWITCH.INI file instead
   of any program default values.

   You can override any switch in  your  SWITCH.INI  file  by  issuing  a
   command string to the specified program containing a complement of the
   switch in your SWITCH.INI file.

   For example, you could have  a  SWITCH.INI  file  in  your  area  that
   contains the following:

        DIRECTORY/FAST

   Then, when you issue the following command:

        .DIR<RET>   

   The system will print a fast (shortened) listing  of  your  directory.
   You  could override the SWITCH.INI file by typing other switches after
   the command.  For example:

        .DIR/NORMAL<RET>   

   The second type of line that can appear in  your  SWITCH.INI  file  is
   written in the following format:

             program-name   Where:    program-name is a program  name  such  as  DIRECTORY,  LINK,
             LOGIN, INITIA, or QUEUE.

             option-name             option-name is the same as  used  for  the  /OPTION  switch.

             Chapter 2.)

   You use the second type of line to override both program defaults  and
   any   defaults  that  you  might  have  previously  specified  in  the
   SWITCH.INI file.  You refer to this type  of  line  in  SWITCH.INI  by
   including  the  /OPTION: switch  in a command string to a program.  If
   you specify an option name in the command string that does not  appear
   in your SWITCH.INI file, the program prints a warning message and uses
   the program defaults.

   Assume that you create a SWITCH.INI file that contains:

        DIRECTORY/FAST/UNITS/SUMMARY
        DIRECTORY:THISRUN/WORDS/ACCESS:25

   If you then type the DIRECTORY command, the program will print a  fast
   listing  showing  both the actual unit names (instead of the structure
   names) and the summary line on  your  terminal.   When  you  want  the
   program  to  print a normal directory listing, you must type a command
   string to DIRECTORY that includes the /NORMAL switch.  Note that  disk
   unit  names,  not  structure names, and the summary line will still be
   printed.

   You can type the following command string to  automatically  list  the
   length  of  the  files  in words, instead of blocks, and to update the
   access date of files with 25 blocks or less:

        DIRECTORY/OPTION:THISRUN<RET>

                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS



   The six basic COMPILE-class commands are:

        COMPILE
        LOAD
        EXECUTE
        DEBUG
        MAKE
        TECO

   Each COMPILE-class command is described in detail in Chapter 2.

   These commands cause the monitor to  run  the  COMPIL  program,  which
   deciphers  the  command  and  constructs  new  command strings for the
   system program (such as, TECO, PIP, FORTRAN).  Each time you type  the
   MAKE  or TECO commands, the command with its arguments is written as a
   temporary file in memory or on the disk.  Therefore,  the  system  can
   recall the last file specification you typed.  This is an exception to
   the requirement that the file name  must  always  be  specified.   For
   example if you type:

        .MAKE PROGX.MAC<RET>

   You can then later type the following:

        .TECO<RET>

   instead of the command line:

        .TECO PROGX.MAC<RET>

   assuming that you have not issued a TECO  command  changing  the  file
   name in the interim.

   The system also writes the COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG commands,
   with their arguments, in two places:

        1.  In memory in temporary files written on device  TMP:.   These
            are deleted when you log out or when the system crashes.

        2.  On the disk in a temporary file.

   When you use a file specification as the  argument  to  one  of  these
   commands, you can use another of these commands with no argument.  The
   stored arguments will be used.



   C.1  INDIRECT COMMANDS (@ CONSTRUCTION)   C.1  INDIRECT COMMANDS (@ CONSTRUCTION)

   Most programs receive input in the form of commands from the terminal.
   However,  it is possible to write a program that accepts commands from
   a file.  That file is known as an indirect command file.

   For example, when you must type many program names and  switches,  you
   can  put  them  into a file that eliminates the need for you to retype
   the names and switches for each compilation.  You can use the  @  file
   construction, which you can type with any COMPILE-class command.

   You can specify an @ file at any point in a  command  line  after  the
   first  word  in the command.  In this construction, when you specify a
   file, you do so by typing its file name, followed by an optional  file
   name  extension  and  project-programmer  number.   If  you  omit  the
   extension, the program searches for a command file with  a  .CMD  file
   name  extension.  If that file is not found, the program then searches
   for a command file with a null  extension.   Then,  when  the  program
   finds the specified file, it places the information stored in the file
   in the command string, replacing @file  name.   If  the  file  is  not
   found, the program prints an error message.

   Example

   If you have a  file  called  FLIST.CMD  that  contains  the  following
   command string:

        FILEB,FILEC/LIST,FILED

   You could replace this command line:

        .COMPILE FILEA,FILEB,FILEC/LIST,FILED,FILEZ

   with the following command line:

        .COMPILE FILEA,@FLIST,FILEZ

   You can have command files that contain the @ file construction  to  a


                                    C-2
                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS


   depth  of  15 levels.  If this process of indirection results in files
   pointing in a loop, the maximum depth is  exceeded,  and  the  program
   prints an error message:

        ?NESTING TOO DEEP

   The following rules apply in handling format characters in  a  command
   file.

        1.  Spaces are used to delimit words, but are otherwise  ignored.
            Similarly,  TABs, vertical TABs, and form feed characters are
            treated as spaces.

        2.  To allow long command strings, command terminators  (such  as
            RETURN,  ESCAPE)  are ignored if the first nonblank character
            after  a  sequence  of  command  terminators  is   a   comma.
            Otherwise,  the  command terminators are treated as commas by
            the COMPILE-class commands.

        3.  Blank lines are completely ignored.

        4.  Comments can be included in command files  by  preceding  the
            comment  with a semicolon; text from the semicolon to the end
            of the line is ignored.

        5.  If command files are  sequenced,  the  sequence  numbers  are
            ignored.




   C.2  THE + CONSTRUCTION   C.2  THE + CONSTRUCTION

   The + construction specifies that the files to the right of  the  plus
   sign  are  combined with the first file you specified.  Therefore, all
   files you specify become one file in the compilation and not  separate
   files.

   This construction is useful when the first file is a subroutine of the
   other files you specified.

   When you use the  +  construction,  the  compiler  produces  a  single
   relocatable  binary  file from a collection of input source files.  To
   construct a single program from several input files, you can name  one
   input  file  FIRST.MAC, another MIDDLE.MAC, and a third LAST.MAC.  You
   can then specify the following command line:

        .COMPILE FIRST+MIDDLE+LAST

   After this, the compiler produces one binary file named LAST from  the
   three source files, FIRST, MIDDLE, and LAST.  This construction allows
   you to use one input file as part of several  different  compilations.


                                    C-3
                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS                           COMPILE-CLASS COMMANDS


   For  example,  you  could later use the FIRST.MAC file with SECOND.MAC
   and THIRD.MAC to obtain a different binary file.  The  +  construction
   permits  you  to  maintain material in a single file that is common to
   more than one compilation.

   The compiler gives the name of the last input file in  the  string  to
   any  output  file  (for example, .REL, .CRF, .LST).  Therefore, in the
   previous examples, the output files would be called  LAST  and  THIRD,
   respectively.  Note that you can include device names, extensions, and
   project-programmer numbers in  any  +  construction.   Therefore,  the
   following is a valid command string:

        .COMPILE FIRST.MAC[27,4072]+SECOND.MAC+THIRD.MAC[35,234]



   C.3  THE = CONSTRUCTION   C.3  THE = CONSTRUCTION

   Usually, the compiler makes the name of the  relocatable  binary  file
   the same as that of the source file, with the extension specifying the
   difference.  You can override this action by using the = construction.
   The  =  construction  allows  you  to  specify the names of the output
   files.  For example, if you need a binary file called BINARY.REL  from
   a source program called SOURCE.MAC, you can type the following command
   line:

        .COMPILE BINARY=SOURCE

   You can also use this construction to specify an  output  name  for  a
   file produced by using the + construction.  To give the name WHOLE.REL
   to  the  binary  file  the  compiler  assembles  with  PART1.MAC   and
   PART2.MAC, you can type the following command line:

        .COMPILE WHOLE=PART1 + PART2

   To change the file name of the output file is the most common  use  of
   the  = construction.  However, you can also use it to change any other
   default condition.  The  default  condition  for  compiler  output  is
   DSK:SOURCE.REL[dir].   If  you would like output on DTA3 with the file
   name FILEX instead of the  defaults,  you  could  type  the  following
   command line:

        .EXECUTE DTA3:FILEX=FILE1.F4



   C.4  THE < > CONSTRUCTION   C.4  THE < > CONSTRUCTION

   The < > (angle bracket) construction can be  used  in  COMPILE,  LOAD,
   EXECUTE, and DEBUG commands only.  You use it to cause programs listed
   within the angle brackets to be  assembled  with  the  same  parameter
   file.   If  you also use the + construction, it must appear before the


                                    C-4

   < > construction.  To assemble LPTSER.MAC, PTPSER.MAC, and  PTRSER.MAC
   with  the PAR.MAC parameter file, you could type the following command
   line:

        .COMPILE PAR+LPTSER,PAR+PTPSER,PAR+PTRSER

   However, using the < > construction you could type the following line:

        .COMPILE PAR+<LPTSER,PTPSER,PTRSER>

   The following command string construction is invalid:

        .COMPILE <LPTSER,PTRSER,PTPSER>+PAR



   C.5  DEFAULT COMPILER   C.5  DEFAULT COMPILER

   When you name a file with a standard file extension (.MAC, .CBL, .FOR,
   .ALG),  the  compiler implied by the extension will be used to compile
   the program.  Standard file extensions are listed in Appendix D.   You
   cannot  override  the  compiler that is implied by the file extension.
   The COBOL compiler will  compile  a  file  called  DATPRO.CBL.   Files
   without  a recognizable compiler extension are compiled by the default
   compiler, normally FORTRAN.

   If you have a file with a non-standard file extension, you can control
   the setting of the default compiler (FORTRAN) by including switches in
   the COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, or DEBUG command string.  The descriptions
   of the COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG commands in Chapter 2 include
   the switches you can use to change the default compiler.

   In the following examples, the installation has chosen FORTRAN as  the
   default compiler.  If you issue the following command:

        .COMPILE NOEXT

   the file named NOEXT will  be  compiled  by  FORTRAN.   The  following
   command:

        .COMPILE FILEZ.MIN

   causes the file named FILEZ.MIN to be compiled by FORTRAN because  MIN
   is not a recognizable compiler extension.  The following command:

        .COMPILE APART,DATA/COBOL,TEST

   causes the files APART and TEST to be compiled by FORTRAN and the file
   DATA to be compiled by COBOL.

                                    NOTE

           By setting the appropriate assembly switches  you  can
           indicate  SNOBOL,  BLISS,  or  MACY11 as the compiler.
           However,  these  switches  and   compilers   are   not
           supported.

   The switches that change the default  compiler  can  be  temporary  or
   permanent.  (See Section 1.8.4.)



   C.6  COMPILER SWITCHES   C.6  COMPILER SWITCHES

   It is occasionally necessary for you to pass switches to the assembler
   or  compiler  in a COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, or DEBUG command.  For each
   translation (assembly or compilation),  the  COMPIL  program  sends  a
   command string to the translator, containing three parts:

        1.  Binary output file specification.

        2.  Listing file specification.

        3.  Source file specification.

   To include switches with these files, you must do the following:

         o  Group the switches according to each related source file,  if
            you use the + construction.

         o  Group the switches according to the three types of files  for
            each source file.  The order of the groups of switches is

            a.  Binary

            b.  Listing

            c.  Source

         o  Separate the groups of switches by  commas  for  each  source
            file.

         o  Enclose all switches for each source file within one  set  of

         o  The switches immediately before a closing  right  parenthesis
            are source (SSSS).

         o  The switches before the first comma are binary (BBBB,,).

         o  The switches before the second comma are listing (,LLLL,).

         o  The order of the switches is BBBB, LLLL, SSSS.

         o  The individual switches are separated by spaces.

         o  The switches contain no more than 150 characters in all.

         o  The switches  contain  only  the  following  non-alphanumeric
            characters  within  the  parentheses:  colon (:), hyphen (-),
            slash (/), comma (,), and parentheses.

   One linking loader is available to you on TOPS-10:  the LINK  program.
              _______ ____ _________ ______   (See  the  TOPS-10 LINK Reference Manual for complete information.) In
   complex loading procedures, it might be necessary to pass switches  to
   LINK  to direct its operation.  The percent (%) character accomplishes
   this passing of switches.

   The LINK switch specification, preceded and followed by  a  delimiter,
   follows the % character.  The delimiter can be any character; however,
   you must be careful that  the  character  you  use  does  not  have  a
   specific  meaning  to  COMPIL.   The @ character indicates an indirect
   command file, and the semicolon (;) causes the remainder of  the  line
   to   be  treated  as  a  comment  and,  therefore,  is  ignored.   The
   recommended delimiter is a  single  or  double  quotation  mark.   The
   beginning and ending delimiter must be the same character.

   A LINK specification consists of the switch name  and,  optionally,  a
                                 _______ ____ _________ ______   keyword  and  a  value.   See TOPS-10 LINK Reference Manual for switch
   formats.
