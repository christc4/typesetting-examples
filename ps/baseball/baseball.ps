%   I wrote this program because I was interested in learning Postscript, and I
% got tired of paying outrageous prices for scorecards at the baseball stadium.
% Most ballparks no longer sell scorecards separately and make you buy a whole
% program just to get the scorecard inside it. Print this on cardstock or
% have a clipboard or piece of cardboard handy. Just don't forget to bring a
% pencil!
