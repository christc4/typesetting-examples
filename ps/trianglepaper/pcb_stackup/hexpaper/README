This program prints out hexagon mapping paper on a PostScript printer.
The size of the hexes is adjustable via the side_size variable. The darkness
of the lines can be changed with the setgray operator and the line thickness
can also be altered with the setlinewidth operator.

Hexagon mapping paper can be printed on any PostScript printer by sending the
file hexpaper.ps directly to the printer after optionally making any desired
changes.  Those without access to a PostScript printer can use Ghostscript /
ps2pdf to convert to Portable Document Format (PDF) and then print the PDF
file.
