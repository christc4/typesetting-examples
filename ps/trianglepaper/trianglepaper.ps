%   This program prints out triangle paper on a PostScript printer. I used it as
% a template to create triangle trusses with toothpicks for a toothpick bridge
% school project. The size of the triangles is adjustable via the side_size
% variable. The darkness of the lines can be changed with the setgray command
% and the line thickness can also be set differently with the setlinewidth
% operator.
