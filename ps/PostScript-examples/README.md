THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT.

## Program

This is a series of PostScript programs that build on top of each other, covering quite nicely the basics of two-dimensional graphic programming, i.e, one can see how one could build on top of the techniques in them to build applications with a four-dimensional interface (mainly videogames).  
PostScript is an old programming language developed by Adobe, so the interpreter can generate .pdf files at demand. I've added them for most of the exercises.  
The language uses Polish notation because the compiler uses a stack to generate machine code.  
These exercises are very approachable since the math in them is very light. In fact, the math in them is an excuse to complicate an otherwise very limited set of exercises. And then there's the Alaska flag. 
This was probably my favorite college project although I couldn't finish it.
